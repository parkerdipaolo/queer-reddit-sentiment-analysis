I AM SO RELIEVED!!!	"I‚Äôm gonna speak about politics but no debate, just a massive relief.

I‚Äôm French, and today, French people elected our president. The choice was between a racist, transphobic and generally lgbt-phobic woman named Marine Le Pen, and a man called Emanuel Macron. 
Since several months, I was afraid Marine Le Pen would be our new president, because she ( and her party ) is hard towards lgbt+ ( and specially the T and + ) people.
So the new president is Emanuel Macron. His precedent mandate was good for us lgbt+ people ( end of the conversion therapies, no more obligated sexual abstinence time - 6 months - for gay blood donors‚Ä¶ ), whereas Mrs Le Pen‚Äôs party voted to exclude transgender from the banishment of conversion therapies.

I‚Äôm so relieved and happy, I was really scared and stressed and didn‚Äôt know what I was gonna do if Mrs Le Pen had been elected. I love you all and wish you all to have as much luck for your next democratic events as we, French trans people, had !"	"As an American, I breathed a sigh of relief. I‚Äôve never technically been to France, and probably will never go, but I‚Äôm happy to see them kick fascism to the curb. Macron may not be the best President ever, but anything is preferable to a fascist.
I'm not necessarily psyched about Macron but same, I was so frkn relieved when I saw the result. I'm still afraid that the fascist got such a high score tho, and I hope we'll manage to build a healthier political landscape in the future
This year we have ellections on brasil, I'm really scared that maybe Bolsonaro can win, even after genocides
I would like to know how LaPen a fascist can get so close to being elected president twice?!?
As someone a short swim away in Scotland, I'm so relieved for yous!!!
I'm not crazy about Macron but this election was a no brainer for the French people. I'm so glad that Macron pulled it out. In less-covered news, Slovenia also had elections today where they ousted a right-wing, authoritarian-leaning government and replaced it with a more liberal, pro-democracy government. Two big defeats for the far right in Europe today!
To my understanding she's basically just a full on fascist, so this was basically just like the 2020 USA election but for France. I was also pretty nervous about this one, glad to see that she lost.
Meanwhile in America, I'm horrified Trump will get another term üôÉ

It's good to see some nations getting it right, though. It honestly keeps me going at times.
Honestly, while it *is* a relief that Le Pen isn't elected, I'm fucking angry at Macron *somehow* being president after the shit show that was the last 5 years
I'm not French, I'm Polish, but I've also been waiting impatiently for the results of the elections and I'm so relieved Le Pen didn't win. So happy for you guys x
Vive la France. I was watching this closely. My congratulations, Love wins over hate again. You keep fighting. All you have to do is exist and exude nothing but love and we shall be victorious. Fireworks tonight. So much winning.
I was watching the election with bated breath, and I‚Äôm glad to see that my trans siblings in France not have to deal with that!
like a friend of mine said : ""we're sure she will advocate against LGBTQIA+ rights, but we're not sure he won't.""
This year is election year on my country, and i feel that i'm in the same situation, but not such in an extreme way

Still, i'm a little nervous about what's going to happen
Love from Poland, at least you got lucky :')
J'ai √©t√© soulag√© aussi m√™me si j'aurais pr√©f√©r√© que ce soit M√©lenchon qui passe avec son progressisme. L√† on reste juste sur la m√™me chose alors que pour l'√©ducation et tout c'est le bordel, m√™me les profs le disent ils gal√®rent avec le gouvernement de Macron. Enfin on ne peut pas tout avoir, comme tu l'as dit au moins le Pen n'est pas pass√©e
Agreed, may Le Pen take the hint and just leave politics.
Whoever you are for, you can‚Äôt deny he did things for us and he‚Äôs way better than far right
Let‚Äôs hope he doesn‚Äôt!
Giving simple solutions to complex problems, using minorities to scare majority, demagogy at a high level, making promises she can‚Äôt keep, speaking in people‚Äôs name and way more. Fascism always found its way, in France and everywhere around the world. An economical crisis ( covid and Ukrainian war ) helps this a lot to be fair.
Unfortunately farcist leaders are de result of all problems of a country.

Here in Brazil we're facing our disgusting president have chance to be elected again..
Heyy Scottish friend ! Love from France ‚ù§Ô∏è
Yeah I saw that and I‚Äôm so glad about that ! I feel  European Union and Europe generally speaking are becoming better space for everyone, except for a little number of countries which are directly exposed to the ongoing war. I hope this will continue and give further results !
Yeah, watching America endorse a fascist might have shown the rest of the world what that can do to a country...

I honestly think people in other nations are more aware of how horrible letting fascism into governments is because of it. Fuck, I bet seeing Putin annihilate his own country is also having the same effect. 

Anyway, it's America, you can never stop hearing about America, even when you don't want to.
Not here to do politics but was it all his fault ? Covid and Ukraine war aren‚Äôt his choices actually, and they took basically half the presidency. He clearly deserves a second chance
Actually we are pretty sure he won‚Äôt, if we see the last 5 years and his objectives. He has bad ministers, I can‚Äôt deny that but he did good things for us, and most of his deputies are and let‚Äôs hope will be former socialists, and they always voted in favor of laws that were good for us ( conversion therapies, no more abstinence time for blood donors, etc‚Ä¶ )
Not even terf tbh. It would really hurt my feminist heart to say that since terfs refer to themselves as feminists, which she clearly does not.

Edit : this comment became useless since you got the ‚Äúterf‚Äù part away
I'm definitely relieved Lepen wasn't elected. She's not even comparable to him, for us, for democracy, etc
But Macron isn't all good. He has a role in the rise of Far-rights and some member of LREM are borderline terfish.
Sorry if I'm kind of a bummer
""better than Le Pen"" may as well be Macron's slogan it seems
M√©lenchon would have been even better, not just for LGBT+ people, but also for people affected by economic inequality, high rents etc. (things which also strongly affects LGBT+ people, who are overproportionally at risk of being poor).
Of course
In other words some of the people's in France are as gullible as they are here in the United States of America.
If that is a reference to Russia, I'm hoping that Ukraine will be the graveyard of the Russian Federation in it's current format. If it's not a reference to Russia, I'd be very interested to know what you mean! üòÉ
Yeah, point well made
Yeah I saw your point and took it out
The f in terf should stand for fascist
This is how I feel about every US presidential election for some time now. It‚Äôs like a choice between a disappointing candidate and a dangerous one.
Nan you‚Äôre totally right. I am a LREM militant to be honest but I hate some of the representatives ( Darmanin, formerly Benallah, etc‚Ä¶ ). Yet I like Schiappa and Moreno a lot, mostly for the laws against sexist harassment, rapes and domestic abuses, and formations of police to take complaints for those violences.

Edit : I mean there that as any political group they are as previously said, not perfect, but they have good points and did good things for feminism and lgbt+ people
Or in United Kingdom or in Germany, Russia, Brazil, and way more ! That‚Äôs exactly it. Fascism relies over those people actually
Yeah it‚Äôs Russia but also Hungary and Poland. Hungary elected again Viktor Orb√°n ( more and more of an authoritarian ) in this context of war started by Russia and Poland still have their hard conservative government ( no abortion ‚Ä¶ )
It‚Äôs fine haha, I just preferred to explain why I made this comment :)
I wouldn‚Äôt say I think President Macron was or is disappointing but more that he has done some errors which I hope he will correct during the five next years. I would have been disappointed in a extreme vs extreme vote, but not by him actually
And actually, if we count the father, it is the third time : 2002, 2017 and now 2022. They have never been that near to presidency tho
Yes, Hungary and Poland have been going down the wrong path for awhile now, and if I'm not mistaken Orb√°n just won re-election =/ I'm also nervous that the current goodwill towards Ukrainian refugees in those countries will fade as the war drags on and fuel more right-wing discontent. But for today, let's just enjoy the victories in France and Slovenia : )"	ub3hd4	trans	1437	0.96	2022-04-24 20:25:49
My very transphobic friend just admitted they‚Äôve always wanted to be a girl	"TW for transphobia.
So my friend (17 m), just admitted that they‚Äôve always wanted to be a girl. But, this is literally the most homophobic, transphobic, everything phobic, arsehole I know, so it‚Äôs sort of a shock he admitted that. I‚Äôd also like to mention that I‚Äôm secretly trans myself lol but obviously he doesn‚Äôt know that.

Basically we were playing minecraft together and I jokingly said to him
‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you always play as a female skin‚Äù, 
Because most of the time he doesn‚Äôt play as a male character.
He avoided the question, also answering jokingly, he said
 ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you always play as a male skin hm?‚Äù, 
I simply told him well it‚Äôs because I am a male, (even though I‚Äôm trans.)
Then he said it, he said something like
‚ÄúI always wanted to be a girl but I‚Äôm not‚Äù,
So I said to him
‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre trans?‚Äù,
And he smirked and said
‚ÄúYou know I don‚Äôt believe in that shit‚Äù
So‚Ä¶. That happened‚Ä¶. But this is actually the most openly transphobic person I know, and quite frankly, they are a bit of an arsehole lol so it‚Äôs very unexpected. This is like my best friend though, and I want to help in some way, I know I can‚Äôt go around telling people if they‚Äôre trans or not and I know there might not be much I can do to change their opinions but like, there‚Äôs got to be something I can do to help right? Even if there‚Äôs just anything I can do to show supportiveness or open his mind slightly? This could be some real nasty denial type thing so I really just wanna help my friend out a little. I mean I myself am struggling with self acceptance so only god knows what he could be struggling with. Anything at all I can do?"	"This is pretty common actually, tons of people ""overcorrect"" way too far in the opposite direction in order to compensate for their actual feelings
Not unusual for the most phobic people to actually be deeply in denial about being whatever it is they're railing against themselves...

Like all those rabidly homophobic preachers who eventually get caught with their same-sex lovers...
Internalized queerphobia can do that to a person. I'd recommend showing them some trans-related content, like Love Me for Who I Am, because they are clearly an egg.
tbh i'd just subtly start showing that you're supportive of the trans community if you havent already. you dont need to come out if youre not ready, but just being open about your beliefs and standing up for those beliefs could make him see that being trans friendly is an option (which will eventually make being trans an option). as you said, when youre surrounded by transphobia, it seems normal. you can show him there are other options. it can be subtle stuff like occasionally sharing someone's queer positivity posts online, or just casually mentioning ""yknow idk why people make such a big deal about having to stay in these narrow little gender boxes, like do they think someone's going to plop over dead if i paint my nails or something"". just gradually introducing the idea that it's safe to talk about gender and there's nothing wrong with being trans. he honestly might just be scared and needing someone brave to show him that not caring about gender norms is like, fine. and just being a safe person to talk to for when he's ready.

you're not obligated to be that person, but if you did want to show support, that's what i would do. i had some friends who sort of paved the way for me to be myself just by them being themselves and it helped so much
This was me when I was 17. Always picked girl characters because I wanted to be s girl but simultaneously hated trans people and thought ""it was bullshit""

Internalised transphobia is very common
I think a lot of us have hidden behind phobia when we weren't ready to accept and deal with being trans.  Like always deflecting anyone from possibly thinking YOU could be one of them! 
You're friend is probably not ready to deal with it all yet so be gentle, don't push them but be there for them and be kind
Send them egg memes
Not sure why you're staying friends with them if they're transphobic, but they're definitely trans themselves, which I wouldn't say is uncommon. Some transphobes are actually trans themselves but are fed lots of misinformation that causes them to be transphobic
Unfortunately it's pretty common.

I wish I could give good advice but I don't really have any.

Just she's hurting a lot so be nice ok?

I know not everyone agrees on this but coming from a similar place I would try to be nice. That's my reasoning.
Poor girl. Hope she winds up okay.
Yup, it's called overcompensating and that used to be what I did. I went from super right-wing bigoted edgy kid to a lesbian trans bb girl so I wish this person the best
This was me for a very long time. I mean, I wasn't hateful or anything. I didn't go out of my way to hurt trans people or any LGBTQ people, I was like ""you do you, that's fine""

I just literally didn't believe it was possible to change your gender and thought that trans people are just living in a delusion. I feel ashamed that I used to think like that and I feel bad for even having typed that sentence now, obviously, I don't think that anymore.

I just thought to myself ""welp, I wish I was a girl, but I can't, that's literally impossible, so I'll just have to live with this feeling and get over it""

I'm 32 now, just a few months after my MTF trans awakening and I feel so fucking guilty, and I regret so much and I just wish I could go back in time and slap myself across the face to not waste my life thinking that my dreams are just dreams and can't be reality.

This kind of internalized transphobia ruined what could have been the best years of my life, my young adulthood was wasted on being someone I'm not because of it.

I hope your friend finds themselves sooner than I did.
That's an egg.
He is just running away from himself, from it true self, but how do you overcome something if you don't face it?
I never was transphobic, but in my high school years I was a misogynist. It took me a long time before that was changed. What helped for me was getting a role model. I remember browsing 9gag and seeing a meme about a crossdressing guitarist called Hizaki. Looked up his band and realized I wanted to be like him. I never started crossdressing but that was the start of me getting over my misogyny and, after fixing my other mental issues this year, realizing I was trans.

Your friend could be in need of a role model like that too but if he's as transphobic as you claim he is then it might be best to subtly start chipping that away first. I don't know how to do that since I undid my misogyny myself but I'm sure you'll find a way. For the meantime just let him know you'll always be there for him whatever decision he makes.
Smoke some weed with him and just start talking about it. Maybe if you are comfortable sharing your own story. You both might benefit from sharing with each other and be able to help each other come out. Your already best friends, I would love to have a person that‚Äôs going through this to vent to. Cis people just don‚Äôt get it sometimes.
r/egg_irl
Maybe make some eggirl jokes, bend some gender norms around your friend, maybe use some masculine rhetoric like ""are you afraid to paint your nails/wear makeup"" stuff like that. If your friend isn't the best of shape, maybe go exercise with them? Like hikes, the gym, what not, and maybe encourage your friend to be more feminine without saying that? Making a safe space to explore gender identity and such
U know I was kinda like that's but that's only because I didn't know and understand fully and one day I just felt like looking it up and seeing what others experiences were like and I swear someone said the exact same shit in my head and all I could do was break down because all I did was ignore myself and my feelings for all these years and some days I still struggle with my identity... A lot of the time I wish I would of concerned about looking it up earlier in life than when I did
I was pretty transphobic when I was a teenager‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs how my parents raised me. Wasn‚Äôt really a reflection of who I actually am. Just a reflection of how parents can be so influential over their kids.
Also what is their home life like? Does he have a transphobic father or uncle? Religious family? Could be extenuating circumstances you aren't aware of?
I was extremely transphobic in middle and high school so I understand. People run away from what they are and sometimes it causes them to hate the people who aren't running
i used to be transphobic as hell too
Sadly,  may of us who can't accept who we are are turn that hate/shame/fear into those who are what we can not admit to ourselves as being. 

I will forever be ashamed of the things I said and did to deny the truth,  especially after learning the truth of how I was born. 

Fear and ignorance are the greatest of enemies. 

Use that window to let them know you will always love and accept them no matter how the shall ever see themselves.
Welp, if they're willing to change and learn, it's possible to help. You could have a chat with them (but don't reveal yourself unless you feel safe/comfortable), and tell them that talking to a therapist (a pro-lgbt one, avoid religious ones) could help them understand those feelings and maybe find ways to act upon them.

Unfortunately, they still need to realize if they're willing to learn or so, or not. You could also argue that cis people seldom question their gender, and that being trans has nothing wrong.
I absolutely recognise this in myself.

Do to Correction of parents I had an absolute Aversion against female behaviour in male. In Dutch we call a somewhat fem person amab ( often gay) a ""nicht"" ( Niece)

I wish I could be more confident to show my fem side more. I think you call it gay behaviour?! In gay man. 

I now myself are out, but not really well enough. Baby steps I guess.

I had a horrible horrible experience as a child. 38 jear later  I finally found myself again. 

I am now 44 married, two kids. I have have been very lucky with my partner. I identify myself now as nb, but I'm very sure that I am woman also. So confusing ü•≤



I hope for the both of you all the best and love in the world. Just be honest with your self. ‚ù§Ô∏èüåà
This was me. I always wanted to be a girl but I was rabidly anti-trans, mostly due to my fundamentalist religious upbringing. Looking back, I'd say I was in denial.
Internalised transphobia
Internalised transphobia
> i want to be a girl

> i don't believe in that shit

What? So they don't believe trans people ""are real"" and yet experiencing feelings of being trans. How does your friend not realise this?
My question is why you're friends with this person who's a super-bigot...
TL:DR. She's almost definitely trans and overcompensating support her but know it's her journey

Sound like she's overcorrecting. You know the stereotype of the homophobic bully who turns out to be gay? It's a result of the same thing. People are raised in homophobic and transphobic environments and told ""these people are sinners these people are delusional these people are wrong"" over and over from the day they're born basically so they'll overcorrect. They'll put on the biggest display of toxic masculinity to try to prove ""I can't be gay I can't be a woman look at how I am"" they fear themselves and try to avoid the notion that they might be something they've been told is wrong. I used to overcorrect. Probably not to the same degree as your friend. But I was homophobic and transphobic growing up when I started to realize I was queer (wasn't sure in what way I thought I was bi now I'm questioning if I just subconsciously knew my attraction to women was in a gay way) I managed to get a little bit past my internalized homophobia... But I was still resentful of the gay people that ""make it their whole personality"" now I realize that was a stupid way of thinking. And I was still transphobic... Now I've come around to accept that I'm not a man. I'm not sure if I'm a she/her woman or a she/they woman. Right now I'm on she/they but I'm starting to wonder if I'm a binary trans woman. And I've come to accept that I'm gay. And I love the people who have the confidence to be openly themselves in every way, the people I once thought of as ""they're making being gay their whole personality"" I realized I'm envious of them. That they can be their true authentic selves and they don't care what anyone thinks. So yeah that's where your friend is now. Overcompensating. But she needs you to be able to help her on her journey. Help. But don't push. It's her journey. You aren't the wizard, you're toto, or the scarecrow, the tin man, the lion... All 4 rolled into one traveling with her down the yellow brick road.
I was the same honestly. Transphobic and homophobic in my teenage years but then as I was exposed to more accepting groups I discovered that I was a girl and that it was all just projection. I hope she comes around too

Life is too short to hate people who just want to exist. Or to be someone who you‚Äôre not. You get one shot, don‚Äôt spend that one chance living a miserable life
be there for him and provide a safe space for him to heal and grow. resist the societal pressure to isolate him. you should only take a break or separate yourself from his presence if he‚Äôs corrosive to your mental health. 

i can‚Äôt be in his head, but he knows you and chooses to hang with you. that itself seems telling. 

i hope whatever happens, he gets to experience what joy feels like just like we did. he‚Äôs young and much more vulnerable than he knows or admits. 

send him my warmest regards 

i was there once
No way, this was literally me for years!
As Mrs. Potts sung it, ‚ÄúTale as old as time, true as it may be.‚Äù
I was transphobic as hell too before I decided to accept myself. Worst decision was to make a music too much transphobic but I prefer to laugh about it
If you think that his Transphobia is performative and meant to make him seem cis, then maybe talk to him about carefully about these things. Maybe start by telling him that you support trans rights, maybe later escalate to coming out to him. 

Don't do anything that you think would put you in danger but showing him that he's not on his own and not without support may do wonders.

Whatever you do, let him be the first person to say (or even imply) that he himself is trans, it's a personal thing and you have to make that discovery on your own to a certain degree.

""No one can tell you what the matrix is, you have to see it for yourself""

Be safe and best of luck to both of you.
Ask a lot of questions to lead him to that conclusion. That‚Äôs how therapists do things actually and it works really well.

Maybe tease him a bit too Like ‚Äúoh no you want to be a girl if only there was something you could do about that‚Ä¶‚Äù so then he‚Äôs bringing it up instead of you.
Sounds like they're scared and over compensating, I did it for a while too, thankfully it wasn't too bad tho. I'd just try to support them and try to subtly show them it's ok to be trans and that you would sorry them if they were. Because he may be acting transphobic but deep down that may be all he wants to be, trans. Obviously there's no telling fs but it feels likely
You could find a way to subtly expose him to the Gender Dysphoria Bible and he may choose to read it out of curiosity?
Do not take this as serious, its just a random suggestion out of personal experience!  
There are a lot of stories from trans people who enjoyed being the other gender, when they weren't out or realised they were trans, in roleplay.

But since you two play minecraft - why not make it a small game or something? Idk like a day where you both play as the desired gender and rp like it?   
I've been there on the homophobic and transphobic side when I was young and looking back on all the stuff i played and roles I took on at play pretend, house etc..   
it always was male, always - I always prefered to play male characters when I could ( I am AFAB btw)   
So since you said he/she  (not wanting to missgender but it seems your friend is maybe in denial) always play female characters, this could lift a few things maybe? Other comments have also very good ideas!   


I hope the best for you two and that your friend and yourself will come to accept yourselfs ‚ô• Its a hard way, but worth it :)
He's been projecting his insecurities onto trans people to cope with being to scared to do anything about it himself. That's literally all it is. He should try to unpack these feelings more.
That‚Äôs actually really sad. I was in the same position before.

I guess what you can do for them is try to direct them away from apps/sites/media where it‚Äôs popular to hate on trans people (what I did for myself) and maybe try to talk to him about the trans community. That‚Äôs really all I can think of.
Work on yourself first do not get too emotionally involved with someone using hateful tactics towards anything. There are plenty of ways he could be in denial without being hurtful and rude. 

If you yourself are closeted and young you really should just prioritize yourself and keep an eye on this person they may be even more hateful if you ever come out to them.
Yeah to be perfect honest I was the same way until I realized (not proud but hindsight is 20/20). I‚Äôm pretty sure that its not uncommon for people to do that, as other people have said just give them light encouragement and let them know that you would still be there for them. Honestly I just did it subconsciously, and even after I realized I still kept up the act for a bit to blend in (really everything-phobic school). Hopefully they will come to there own conclusions themselves, but just be there to give them a little push from time to time.
‚ÄúYeah dude and some people didn‚Äôt believe in Covid still got it. If you want to be a girl and you‚Äôre AMAB that makes you trans. It‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs literally okay. Give yourself time to accept that wanting to be and being a girl is okay. No big deal.‚Äù
I was the same before I meet my husband. One year later and I came out.
I don't know what to really tell you. I used to be transphobic but it took me being educated and just actually looking into my deep dysphoric thoughts and denial to fully realize who I am. It took lots of just researching from reliable sources and overall just looking around to find myself.
A couple of years ago I was all the phobics you could think. I always had that desire to live as a woman, but I thought back then trans people became trans for purely sexual reasons and that they were pretending to be something they weren't, it's what I was taught growing up and all I heard about. With time my views began to change, and I had a lot of time to think and question my beliefs and now I accepted myself as trans.

&#x200B;

Edit for some advice: For me I had a friend who was gay and while talking I mentioned reading a book from Jordan Peterson and he told me I should watch a video from Aaron ra talking about Jordan's book. That started the journey for me. I noticed that people who were critical about right wing content weren't crazy people having meltdowns, they were just like any other person. I began watching, reading and considering different points of views and it led me to where I am now.  So maybe if they mention something similar try telling them that they should watch this other interesting video after and then you can send them a video that shows a different perspective. Try not to be too pushy though that might make them a bit defensive and unable to consider other points of view.
My sister‚Äôs the same way, she‚Äôs the most transphobic person I know but once told me that she hopes she‚Äôll be reborn in her next life as a man. üíÄ

I tried to help her bc she knows I‚Äôm trans but she got really terrible to be around for a while so I dropped it.
Poor girl. I hope she doesn't take as long as I did to self-accept. 

I think the best thing to do is to open her mind a bit, and get her less transphobic. Make sure she knows she'll still have a friend no matter what. Over time, her barriers will break down. 

Potential triggers ahead?:

Personally it took me till this year (I'm 29) to self accept. Like your friend, I always wanted to be a girl, but I was born a boy. Im a 90s baby, so the attitude in society was pretty transphobic most of my life, and caused me to suppress my feelings. I had many daydreams and fantasies about being transformed into a woman, but always felt like I did something wrong afterwards and told no one about them. I was transphobic myself, and ended up thinking I had a fetish for trans women bc I liked watching p*rn with trans women. 

When I was about 24, a coworker came out as trans male and I almost broke my shell then, but didn't relate 100% to his experiences and ended up googling if I was trans, and found a post that made me feel like my desires weren't valid for being ""trans enough"" - I never cross dressed or played with girls toys as a kid and thought that was a requirement. 

All of this is to say - try and help your friend get rid of these social programmings that I struggled with personally, hopefully it will make them self-accept sooner, especially before they get far into being changed by Testosterone. Starting transition by age 20 is so helpful from what I've seen. 

Best of luck to you and your bestie! üíì
Sadly we don't get to pick the ideology and belief systems we are born into, even if they are antithetical to the core of our being. We grow up with all kinds of things normalized which may conflict with our inner selves. That means that for some they not only have to make a gender and social transition, but they have to change their core operational foundation for their sense of self and their view of the world. Just like the rest of transition, it's a slow process that happens in incremental steps and requires desire to change and consistent effort. Not all of us are aware we need to make this mental transition, because we are fooled into thinking how normal our own experience is when even we also know it's not. We just get stuck on trying to figure out why we can't just like ourselves.

I'm saying this from experience. I was born to hate myself before I even knew who I was. That's a huge problem, because you can unknowingly fool yourself into thinking the reason for that is because you are trans, or some other random fact about you that's out of your control. I was so desperate to be accepted despite all my, ""shortcomings"" that I'd end up putting up with all kinds of terrible behavior in my life. This is all stuff that has taken so much time and pain to see and recognize and work on.

Being trans or queer does not automatically imprint liberal views on you. I think when your belief system puts you at odds with who you are, people tend to double down on trying to fit in and suppress themselves even harder. Belief systems can't change overnight either, it's a slow process of learning and unlearning. You don't just teleport from one end of the idealogical spectrum to another, it's a journey. This person clearly has a long journey to make, and it's up to you if you wanna be around that. I personally had to break all contact with my family and other people to get away from these toxic systems. Even other queer people who were never anything but condescending, judgey, and controlling despite the fact they accepted my, ""transness"". It sucks to see other people who are going through this, but at the same time I don't have any control over other people.

As far as what to do, the best thing you can do is realize it's not your responsibility or under your control to fix them or change them. There is nothing you can do that will just change the way they see themselves. You can continue to be there and listen, and ask a thought provoking question every now and then. If you try to confront someone like this it will usually backfire. You may think outing yourself to them might also be helpful, but that could also backfire on you. If you are really determined to help a person like this, the best way is to just gently hold up a mirror, using the art of reflection.

Based on what you posted about the convo, what that might look like in response to their reply is, ""It sounds like you don't believe you are trans, but it sounds like you have thought about being a girl quite a bit"". And that's it. It's not confrontational, nor is it driving any agenda, it's just a simple reflection, and will likely prompt some elaboration by them on the topic to which you can continue reflecting. This is the best tool for disarming someone because you are indicating that you are both listening and understanding without judging or preaching to someone. You can ask curious questions, like how much have you thought about being a girl? When did you first start thinking about it? If you could flip a switch and be a girl without disrupting your life, would you do that? Again though be very mindful of how they are responding, reflect and respect. If they don't wanna talk about it just let it go. Always try to ask questions from a curious place, and not try to be making a point. You want them to stay focused on themselves, and not you. It may be hard to do this without taking what they say personally, so that's why it's important to pay attention to and prioritize your needs and internal state as well, because reacting to what they say will just create more disconnection.

It's hard not trigger someone to put their guard up in these situations. They wouldn't be at odds with themselves if they weren't already set up this way. It doesn't matter how much you think you understand where they are coming from, just pointing things out may feel like an attack. I think just continuing to be an open and engaged friend is the most you can do unless you also want to be their therapist. If you really want to help them understand themselves more, you might wanna read up on something like Non Violent Communication, or lookup other similar tools on creating emotional safety, compassionate listening, etc...

Just please take care of yourself first, and it's totally ok not to make yourself responsible for helping them. You can only help people who want to be helped, and the next best thing is just being a good safe person to talk to, and helping them see the door, but they have to open that door themselves.
A classic...

The biggest phobes are closeted.
Share this with him it‚Äôs how I realized, the female game character thing is one of the signs.

https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/
Work on yourself first do not get too emotionally involved with someone using hateful tactics towards anything. There are plenty of ways he could be in denial without being hurtful and rude. 

If you yourself are closeted and young you really should just prioritize yourself and keep an eye on this person they may be even more hateful if you ever come out to them.
Honestly I did it too before I realised. I mean I hang around with these types of people a lot so it was just the normal, I was never as bad as this guy though. Anything I can actually do to help or do I just leave it and move on?
I was the manliest of men before I realized I wasnt a man. Now I wish all that manliness was gone so people would stop calling me he/him üò≠
I remember growing a big old bushy beard and buying a bench press about 6months before I cracked.

I was convinced I could just exercise the thoughts away ü§£
That's very true. I unfortunately used to be transphobic. I didn't realise until I was trans that it was because it hit too close to home and I didn't like that
Means people like Donald Trump are trans?? üò≥
If we're talking about the religious kind of preachers, I'ma correct that to

\*same-sex children they sexually abuse
It's like how ben shapiro massive sets off my trans radar
I wasn't like INSANELY transphobic but I definitely was somewhat and made inappropriate jokes right along side my old transphobic friends.

Sometimes you really are projecting
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd take it seriously if I introduced them to any serious trans/lgbt contentüò≠
Ok thank you! This is really helpful, and thanks for giving some examples because i was sort of struggling to come up with ways to subtly introduce these ideas
This comment belongs at the top
Alright thanks, I‚Äôll keep all this in mind and definitely make sure not to push him
Don‚Äôt worry I completely understand it, I also came from the same place a couple months back, I never realised my friend would be doing it for the same reason as me though‚Ä¶
I really agree. And most often, it takes time for people to process these internal feelings and come to terms with them; whether those feelings are related to identity, beliefs, desires, fears, etc.

And processing those feelings can be even more difficult to navigate when surrounded by cultural norms which contradict or even punish the implications of those feelings.

So for this friend, you could even say something as simple and genuine as: ‚Äúif you wanted to be a girl, I‚Äôd support you. You‚Äôre my friend, of course I‚Äôd support you.‚Äù

Even if that‚Äôs the end of the conversation, you‚Äôre practically giving this friend permission to entertain the idea in a safe environment. We as people often feel like we need ‚Äúpermission‚Äù to push back against societal and cultural norms without punishment, whether we get that ‚Äúpermission‚Äù from ourselves or from others.

So yeah, be genuine and kind and keep yourself safe (because, sadly, some people can‚Äôt be trusted with our secrets or valuable things). Hope it goes well!
There could be those circumstances causing it. I know his home life is unique, I won‚Äôt go into too much details of what I know, but it could be a cause. I don‚Äôt think it would be the sole reason for his personal transphobia though, because he really overdoes it unlike anybody else I‚Äôve ever seen.
I‚Äôm not completely sure what he meant by that either. I suppose he means he doesn‚Äôt believe people can change gender? But I don‚Äôt know. Also he doesn‚Äôt realise that those 2 things he said conflict each other because of denial and lack of education probably
Well I used to be just like him before I figured out I was trans myself, and I haven‚Äôt really got rid of my transphobic friends. I‚Äôve made a few more lgbt supportive friends since then, thats just so I‚Äôm not always surrounded by self hate, but yeah I don‚Äôt plan on ditching any of my old transphobic friends yet because I‚Äôm not out to anybody and we‚Äôre all good friends and have been for a while. Apart from the bigot stuff he‚Äôs a good friend and fun to hang around with anyways
Alright thanks for writing this and your other comment. They‚Äôve actually used the ‚Äòmaking it their whole personality‚Äô thing a lot‚Ä¶ Guess it comes to show how similar some of our experiences are in this community! Hopefully as you said in the other comment I can help make a safer place for them to figure it out and be accepted somewhere once the egg cracks
We have done lots of roleplay type stuff in games, so it wouldn‚Äôt be a new idea. He does usually play female characters but the only thing is it‚Äôs going to be difficult to pick up on why he‚Äôs playing those characters, everything is displayed as a joke to hide his real feelings, so who knows what ones are a joke and whats not lol. Thanks for your help and support btw <3
This is probably the most helpful comment yet! Tysm, this is a great insight into helping out my friend. The reflection ‚Äòtool‚Äô is something I hadn‚Äôt thought about and it‚Äôs going to be super helpful for not seeming confrontational. But damn, this thank-you message is tiny compared to all the helpful info you just posted so thanks I really appreciate it!
You could just offer support, my partner figured out i was trans within a couple months of dating, nd it still took me 2 years to figure it out for myself

Like they would say its ok if you are trans, but never pushed me on it which was good i think
I think the main way to support her at least at this stage is make it clear (without necessarily saying it) that if she decides she wants to come out to you that you will be open to hearing her out and that you will love and support her just the same. Right now she needs a safe place to figure herself out. It's not your job to crack her egg just make sure she knows she'll be accepted when it does crack
yep i feel you, i was like this too
Thats also another overcompensation that happens, you also wouldnt believe how many trans people just join the army as their last ditch effort lol
Same. The Hipster Ron Swanson Era of performative millennial manliness did a number to me. It reinforced egg-me's shell in a layer of plaid button ups, crudely made woodworking projects, and craft beer cans.
I always wished my ex wouldn't see me as cute and rather as hot. Now I know, I love to be cute and girly. It's such a rough and long journey. Anyways, Good luck on yours!
Yup this is a tale as old as time lol
This but im ftm so i tried to learn how to do makeup lol. Gave up on that after about a week
I bought a bunch of testosterone supplements and creatine and then asked the doctor to test my hormone levels. I had convinced myself that I had low T, but my hormone levels were very normal. That's when I knew I needed HRT.
Yup i was mildly transphobic as well, but we live, learn, and do better
Unfortunately that too, yeah....

The particular one I was thinking of though got caught with an adult lover and a whole mess of cocaine....
Homophobia still seems to be the root of the cause imo.

""I'd like to be with a guy, but not openly... Hm, children might keep their mouths shut."" And then they just say, fuck it. Completely oversimplified, but this is what I could imagine it looks like. Being afraid of being found out that they have  a same sex 'relationship' after preaching homophobia for so long so they try to keep it down with as low a risk of it coming out as possible. 

Don't get me wrong it's still abuse and still absolutely terrible.

This world is so messed up in so many ways.
Omg! As much as I hate that mf'er I would love nothing more than to hear him come out as trans. I can already hear millions of republicans heads exploding.
I love the ""Ben Shapiro Is Abby Shapiro"" conspiracies.
Maybe that could work though! Get him to watch it under the pretense of like, ‚Äúhaha isn‚Äôt this weird‚Äù and he‚Äôll definitely outwardly be like ‚Äúyeah, super weird‚Äù but maybe something that explains a bit would bring down his transphobia, even if just a little.
no prob! good luck!
I'm not sure if you meant to respond to me or OP?
It's so frustrating to see people who make up their mind about something without knowing enough and then never reconsidering even when it might impact their own lifes like that...
Well good luck with that, I suppose.
I know you'll do your best at least. I do think worst case scenario if you have to step away from the friendship because of their homophobic and transphobic behavior make sure they know that when they realize they're being stupid they can always reach out to you
Mhh makes sense :D Yeah thats a difficult egg to crack then (if its an egg at all lmao)   
But I am sure you will figure something out with all the help ‚ô•
It‚Äôs super difficult to have a genuine, serious conversation with him when it comes to this stuff, but I‚Äôll try to show support without being pushy of anything. thanks for your help
I'm in the exact same boat. I had a non-binary bit while I was on my way to cracking, and they way they smiled for me felt uncomfortable at first? But looking back on it, it was a knowing smile. They knew I was a girl just waiting to come out and they were so excited to see it happen naturally as I felt more and more like myself around them.
Yooo I joined the army at 17 (not because of trying to be what I wasn‚Äôt, but because it was a family thing) and it was what made me realize I didnt like being a guy; they are gross, rude, and obnoxious! (Not all of them of course!! This has just been my experience, but it made me see I wasnt just different from ‚Äúthe guys‚Äù I WASNT a guy
Wait... How did you knowwww
I thought i had pcos and it was making me trans!
thats sigma though
I didnt know about them
The other thing to consider is it might just not be worth it too, but thats something you'd have to figure out
Like i don't wanna say its a coincidence, but like lol
I had this experience in high school and college where I never really felt like I belonged with ‚Äúthe guys‚Äù and found most of them gross and annoying but still sort of clung to trying to be a non-toxic form of masculinity. My boyfriend always joked that I was the one non-toxic cis man we knew so it‚Äôs especially funny now that I‚Äôm not a man üíÄ
I have to know the story of how you fooled yourself into thinking you have pcos
Yeah.. in the end it may not be worth the effort at all, but this is my best friend so I might as well try! (Or at least that‚Äôs how I see itüòÖ)
Forreal lol, when I told my dad he wasnt sure how to take it at first. I think he is coming around to it? But I was just like ‚Äúdude you wanted me to join, reap what you sow‚Äù
i have a lil mustache and i get bad cramps, that's about it lol.  I also thought i might be intersex. Basically I was looking for a ""medical"" explanation, that i was ""born this way"". Bc even though I thought I was a good ally, I still subconsciously believed that trans people are crazy, and I didn't want to be trans bc i was afraid of people thinking that about me
Maybe over time change the tone? Make sure that he knows he has at least one friend once he decides to accept himself.

Like when that topic comes up be again be like ""dunno man, live and let life. If you were trans I would still be your friends"" and stuff like that. 

You could also take the nuclear option and tell him you feel the same way.

(I am also not misgendering him on purpose but as he does not see things that way at this point in time...)
I agree with this take, but I think there's a good middle ground.

Maybe next time you're playing, find a way to ease back into the topic. You could let them know you actually feel the same way about wishing you were a girl, but let them know that you did a lot of research and found out that a lot of what you were told about what being trans is wasn't true. You don't have to commit to outing yourself, but you can plant that idea in their head, as a trusted friend and someone they probably ascribe their own views to, in order for them to maybe do some thinking on their own time.

If they think YOU are similar to them and can do that research and come to that conclusion, it helps break down a lot of mental gymnastic-driven barriers for denying your identity via internalized transphobia. A lot of people that hate trans people just don't know any."	whzrgu	trans	980	0.99	2022-08-06 22:15:25
I gotta get out of town‚Ä¶	"Tonight at my birthday get-together, something brought it up‚Ä¶  My friend started talking about this friend of his he visited once. He talked about this guy‚Äôs ‚Äúdaughter that ended up turning into a man‚Äù‚Ä¶

My dad decides to chime in and saying, ‚Äúwell guess what‚Ä¶ THAT AIN‚ÄôT A MAN‚Äù, or something like that, and they started laughing‚Ä¶

My mom just STARED at me, because she can recall our past four ‚Äúcoming out‚Äôs‚Äù.

My dad even made multiple LGBT-phobic remarks all night about ‚Äúmen in tights‚Äù, and saying that they ‚ÄúAREN‚ÄôT REAL MEN‚Äù, all because another friend brought up ‚Äúmen in tights‚Äù and then the whole transphobia thing with my dad, etc etc‚Ä¶

I just had to recoil and smile the whole time, while overhearing it all‚Ä¶ ‚òπÔ∏è

EDIT: What‚Äôs even more ironic is that my dad actually mentioned the one time years ago that he dressed up in blackface as a woman, AND WON THE COSTUME CONTEST."	"Oh god. Sending lots of hugs and mental fortitude. 

Yes you need out. I'm sorry you had to deal with that. :(
There's a double-standard that somehow a person AMAB is simultaneously both not a man and still a man when wearing feminine clothing, depending on which one would be most offensive to the person.

My dad told me he was ""so uncomfortable seeing her dressed like a boy"" when my non-binary spawn of my sister was performing a school play.  My dad is the only one in my family I haven't come out to and now I know I wont be able to.

The most I can offer is to just let you know you're not alone.
How old are you? You know what it doesn't matter, I'm your dad now. üò§
I'm sorry to hear that, honey. 

Try not to worry about it, okay? You are a wonderful woman and you deserve to be respected, don't mind comments like that. 

I know it's hard, especially since these comments were made by your father, but you'll be able to move on. 

Happy birthday, and I'm your new father now :)
To these people you're not a man of you don't conform to traditional gender roles but as soon as that ""man"" comes out as a trans girl/woman it's ""Man!"" ""MAN!!"" ""M-A-N"" all day long. üôÑ

Their stance is not at all based in kindness or understanding, nor is it even consistent or accurate. It's not your problem and once you get them out of your day to day life it'll be good riddance.
Pain in the ass, i guess i barely understand you, but can't tell, everyone fell differently of the others...
Good luck queen üòî
Damn... Sending out blessings for you!

What are your preferred pronouns? Asking out of curiosity.
If you need another parent, hit me up, though I'm just a month older than you
your dad is a piece of shit

edit: though that's just my opinion. if you still care for your father that's fine, just i don't. we're all different. my mom was bad at motherhood, but as much as i dislike her for that she's supportive now especially for my trans status so i care for her a little more with each passing minute
>My dad even made multiple LGBT-phobic remarks all night about ‚Äúmen in tights‚Äù, and saying that they ‚ÄúAREN‚ÄôT REAL MEN‚Äù

This is a great opportunity to say something snarky like ""So you DO agree that trans women are women. I'm so glad you're supportive!""

Maybe this is why my parents beat me as a kid lol
this is what i call a man child. a man who isnt even close to a  definition of a man. he makes men look like a disgrace. shit im a trans man who wears makeup and paints my nails and i got recorded once. yea it hurt but thats not gonna stop me from being a bigger man then they ever will be. im sorry about your father and if you do decide to move out, you can always vut him out of your life. we are here for you üíú
‚ÄúYour friend‚Äù sis that‚Äôs not your friend
UPDATE: What‚Äôs even more ironic is that my dad actually mentioned the one time years ago that he dressed up in blackface as a woman, AND WON THE COSTUME CONTEST.
sorry for your experience...

hope that you and your mom can find a way out... no one should have to live with someone like your dad...  (i know, my mom was like that... talking bad about something knowing that the other person couldn't defend themselves)...

escaping was my... best day.  idk how i lived like that...

escaping my first and second (my only) ex's was similar.  some people won't let other people be themselves... wants to control them...    escaping is life...

sorry your birthday was ruined... i've.. been there...  just try to ""redeem"" it next year... surrounded by people who love u 4 u :)
I'm so sorry that you are having to go through that. I've had to do the same with my father. I'm a trans woman and he said a lot of the same things ""that I will never be a woman and you will never look good."" He was wrong on both parts. As time goes on I hope you dad gets better.
I'll adopt you
I bet I could guess the region of the world you live in. Also, as a software designer and coder, I like the ""girl software, boy hardware"" :)
I stfg if you were in the UK I'd come get you right now, I have a spare room...
That makes me so fucking mad what the hell
Oh my god that's horrible. I'm sending you hugs.
My suggestion after a breif read: Call them on their shit, then tell them to shut up and change the subject. Unless you are dependent on them/it would endanger your safety.
On my birthday, technically, especially.
‚Ä¶he does realize that people have played characters that are other genders since the conception of ‚Äútheater‚Äù, right?? i feel like this is one of those places where people trying to act more transphobic has actually made them more closed-minded than they would‚Äôve been if they hadn‚Äôt been putting in an active effort. sorry you have to deal with this üòï

That's a good name. Not only is it a name from a old (and canceled but you could probs bootleg it) TV show called Firefly, but it's also the name of a halfway decent characters in one of my favorite (fairly new) games, Cyberpunk 2077! Good choice. üëçüèª

Interesting! I didn‚Äôt know either one of those connections!
You're right, but I shall be better! I am new at fathering a (probably) human person! (Please imagine a determined pic/emoji here - my iPhone doesn't have a determined emoji lol)
You may need practice at the dad-jokes, but... you are already incredibly supportive and know how to admit your own failings... that is what makes a dad a great dad... üòò
Yup! The one from Firefly is a girl named River Tam, and the one from Cyberpunk is a cop named River Ward that kind of, in my opinion at the very least, looks like Derek Morgan from Criminal Minds.

"Should I say ""Screw it""?"	"My mom told me that she needed to borrow $500 from my savings last night in order to take care of some things, so I obliged and gave her the $500.   


I am supposed to start HRT Monday, so a lot of the funds that I had saved up are gone until TUESDAY when my mother can put my $500 back in my account (I have about $1700 left rn)... The only issue is that when she does that, she will most likely see the transactions from Spectrum (my clinic) and Publix (my prescription provider).   


Should I go ahead and reschedule my appointment in a safer time frame on March 3 (supposed to be alone with my girlfriend in Orlando, away from my parents) ...  


... or should I still go for this appointment and spend the money, and allow whatever consequences to happen, happen?  


 I'm honestly tired of waiting, and these are my two options...  


(KEEP IN MIND, MY PARENTS ARE LGBT-PHOBIC, AND THIS MIGHT NOT GO WELL)"	"If they are giving you money back, I don't get how they will see your transactions. That's not how banking works in the UK
Time to set up a new account. It only takes a few minutes, he‚Äôll there are online accounts. If they can‚Äôt handle your transition, then they don‚Äôt need to handle your money.
You could say you‚Äôre having issues logging into your bank account and ask her to pay you back in cash maybe?
Could you buy a prepaid card and use that for the payments? I think that if you went to Walmart and bought like a prepaid card and a few small items, it would appear in the account as a walmart transaction, and you could just claim the money was spent there?
No girl, open your own account NOW and transfer YOUR  money. Don't get caught through inaction.....you've got this!!  ü•∞ü•∞  Lilli~
Get out of the shared account asap if your parents are transphobic. Last thing you need is them finding out and draining the account.
Could say you were helping a friend in need? They didn‚Äôt have funds at the time so you helped them out?
Depending your age if no longer a minor id open your own account and put it there
bruh more than anything its time to pull your cash out and get your own bank account. Bank account sign up is super easy you literally take your money wander into a bank and make you an account there, takes maybe 15-20 minutes and carries the same energy of creating an email. Alsoooooo do you know where your papers are? I'm talking social security card, birth certificate, passport etc. To be frank it sounds like youre in a controlling abusive situation and you need to have your shit wired a little tighter. Get control of your money and your papers this two things alone will take you farther. And yes she will absolutely be mad when you make your own bank account but I'd dare say explaining the desire for personal responsibility is going to be a lot easier than explaining being trans to a transphobe.
How will they see the transaction I don't understand this unless of course she's doing it or or let me rephrase that if you have a joint account with her and because they have lgbtq phobia, maybe you should Huggz them while telling them because at that point they'll be embracing you just a thought
Huggz Becky üá®üá¶
hey, just want to ask for a quick clarification to try and help‚Ä¶ üíñüòñüòìüíïüíñüíñ

are you saying even just in using HER account and sending you money she will see your transaction history? or does she have DIRECT ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT and that‚Äôs how she‚Äôd see your transaction history??? sorry if that seems like a dumb question just a little hard to understand from my region and the banking systems we use here üòìüíñüíï

cause if it‚Äôs just that she has complete access to your account and that‚Äôs how she‚Äôd see all recent account history, maybe you could come up with some reason to ask for her to give you back the money in cash instead for some sort of like‚Ä¶ farmers market or used goods market you‚Äôre hoping to visit and need to pay with cash at so then she won‚Äôt even come close to seeing it??? or maybe, honestly, if it just shows recent history no matter how she accesses and see it, maybe you could try to make a few super small purchases after like going to lunch or picking up some personal supplies or groceries, that way the charges from your appointments would be further down the list and potentially off the page of how much is first shown at a glance? that way unless she has a reason to want to dig through it she more than likely to just say ‚Äúoh, okay, nothing strange or out of the ordinary far as i can see, guess everything is fine and i‚Äôll just exit out and not think on it‚Äù

hope these ideas help, we‚Äôre all praying for you üíñüòìüòìüíïüíñüíñ
Honestly, when you get so far into T, they'll figure it out, it gets harder to make your voice a higher pitch, and the higher you try to make your voice, the more voice cracks you get, you also get harrier and they might notice, so you should think about that too
Call your clinic and ask if you can pay cash (shouldn‚Äôt be a problem at Publix). Make a cash withdrawal and pay that way. If your parents ask about the withdrawal, say you needed the cash to buy some concert tickets from a friend or something.
Im so sorry...
Honestly I say just go for it, and if she's transphobic that's her problem and she'll just have to fucking deal with it.
Is your mom able to log into your bank account? That‚Äôs the only way I could think of that she could see all your banking details. If so I would change your log in credentials. If your bank account is listed as an account that she is the primary holder of and you are just an authorized signer, I would get your own separate bank account tbh.
So you share your money with your parents even though you can't share your identity with them?
Does she know what spectrum is? If she‚Äôs that queerphobic you could probably just say that it‚Äôs a fancy clothing brand you ordered from and the Publix is a multivitamin.
Make whichever decision you feel is correct ‚ù§ but due to the nature of non accepting family just be cautious wait if possible but if not then go ahead I wish you luck on the journey ahead OP üòÅ
Spectrum is also an internet provider where I live if you wanna use that as a bluff.
You have to live your life for you, not them
Maybe pay with a one time use/ burner credit card, assuming you can put money on there?
Wait. I know it's hard to but it's better to be safe.
Here's what you should do (In my opinion)

Reschedule the appointment.
Make a new bank account.
The second you get the 500 back put all your money in the new bank account.
Get that good HRT.

This is probably the safest way to do this and the best way to ensure you get all your money.
Hey Jamie,
I suggest one of the following, but you do you!
Go to the bank and withdrawal the amount you need?

Tell her just to give you cash... keep a stash somewhere like a safe?

Prepaid  card? 

7 months in for me, and knowing then what I know now, there is no way I'd reschedule!  (Just me)

Not sure about your doctors but changing the appointment might not look good for you transition goals? I know some doctors take schedule changes as a sign that it is not that bad or you are not needing care... (I know that is not right, but possible) 

As for the parents, it is going to be evident in time, but definitely stay safe, 6 months in I had a friendly tell me it is visible... though everyone is different. 
     They are probably going to react the same way if it is now or within the year... not to stress you out, but I suggest do be ready, have facts and spell it out, or the will google and that is not always the best!

You have a good name, River is strong, water being one of the most powerful and beautiful things on the planet!

I wish you the best! ‚ôæ‚ù§üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàü¶Ñ You Got This Girl!
Based from other comments, 100% make your bank acc private to you (make yourself the sole owner) or set up a new bank account. You are 22, you are grown. Your mom doesn't need to be updated on everything you do (even tho she prolly feels like she does). Good luck with everything
I mean, depending on circumstances you could say you wanted to get checked for STDs if the question comes up about the expense, that'll cover it until you need a refill. 
Kind of depends how likely they are to ask, as someone eho was closeted for decades, you'd be surprised how much I can hide in plain sight.
Maybe ask for cash that you can deposit yourself? Make up some bs excuse for wanting cold hard cash (maybe try some fancy words like ""wealth diversification"")
If you have a safety plan, I‚Äôd say screw it if you‚Äôre tired of hiding it


HOWEVER you have to remember that safety needs to be your #1 priority. If you have no safety net of any kind if this goes south, you might get stuck in a tight place and regret it, putting strain on yourself you‚Äôre not ready for. If you have a backup plan, though, then you‚Äôre covered in any scenario. I‚Äôd also look into making another account in case your parents pull some toxic behavior stunt. Be careful! üíõ
It's through Regions online banking, so every transaction, even paypal, is visible.
Good point.
In fact, I‚Äôll chime in and say you probably really don‚Äôt want them handing your money.
It's telehealth. It has to be an online transfer.
Well, since it is money that I made personally, couldn't I do something about that fact if they were to drain it?
I'm 22.
Say I spend $600 through Paypal for something VR related... It shows up as ""$600, PAYPAL"" or something like that.
she has direct access...
I'm transfem. XD
Telehealth. Cash won't work.
<3
but the thing is, if she ""just has to fucking deal with it"" it'll lead to more tension in the family, making relations extremely difficult.
I don't always share money... They have their account.
She canceled my appointment last time.
Thank you.
Same here, but she has already canceled my appointment once.
That transaction still shows up if the burner card has a balance from my checking. If I take cash out for the burner card, it shows a transaction from the ATM...
I‚Äôve never liked cash. Lol
Yes, to you. But if someone is paying YOU money, they don't see YOUR transactions. That's madness
Yeah then you can deposit the cash
make a new account without their knowledge
Id they have access to it they can just take it. It will be a pain to get it back. I recommend making a new account.
Ouch,üò≥ oh so you have a joint account. Well I would say it's time to get your own account and transfer your money over to it that's what I would do I wish you the best and I know what you're talking about girls software boy hardware yes I know all about that and I wish my boy hardware we just disappear cuz I want my girls software LOL

i see, and i am so so sorry that this is happening and you‚Äôre having to deal with this ü•∫üòìüò≠üíîüíï of course just like everybody else here i don‚Äôt want you to do anything you don‚Äôt want to do, and i want you to stay safe and do whatever you think is best for yourself ü•∫üòìüíïüíñüíñüíñ personally if possible i think those are decent options if your mom isn‚Äôt the kind of person who would or does already scan through all your transaction history when accessing your account and thus if trying to remove the reason for her to access it herself to deposit what she owes you by giving you cash instead or by covering up the immediate account history with other purchases could potentially be enough to get her to not notice and know anything üíñü•∫üòìüíïüíñ however again, i want you to stay safe ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫üíïüíñ and if waiting is something you are able to manage mentally and emotionally and physically to begin your transition‚Ä¶ then hopefully there‚Äôs no other delays either and in just a little tiny bit more time you will be back on track ü•∫üòìüíñüíï but if waiting isn‚Äôt something you want to or cannot do‚Ä¶ i think potentially trying to put in little safe guards like this to try and help decrease the likelihood of your mom seeing and investigating the charges on your account is a good thing to consider instead of just giving it all up to luck and saying (as you suggest in the title üòñüòìüíîüíï) ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù üíñü•∫üòìüíïüíñüíñ
OMG IM SO SORRY, I THOUGHT THIS POST WAS IN r/ftm I am SO SO SORRY

Instead of the voice, They'll start noticing a Chest, lol, so you might wanna get a compression shirt or something just in case


P.S. I'M SORRY FOR THINKING YOU WERE TRANS MASC, I FEEL SO BAD
Then you could wait till Orlando. Even then take care to not get caught. But yeah, you have like 6 to 8 months till it‚Äôs possible they find out so count on with that time extra to find yourself a safe place where you can live and have your ups and downs as you transition. Sis, everything is going to be freaking fine you‚Äôll see. But don‚Äôt do dumb movements don‚Äôt get caught for free ‚ô•Ô∏è
I would open a second bank account without your parents cosigning ASAP. See if any local banks are open on Sunday, or go first thing in the morning on Monday. Transfer the money to the new account, pay from the new account. 

Alternatively, find a different excuse for why you went to the clinic. Tell them you got herpes and had to pay for tests and medication to treat it.
Don't give them your money if they wouldn't give you unconditional support.
No I mean that my mother will see that I transferred however much to these two areas, and will DEFINITELY hound me about it if she finds out.
I want my girly hardware too!
No worries! No harm done here!
Compression shirts aren‚Äôt typically recommended for people taking feminizing hormones, they can harm breast growth
Don't give harmful advice! Compression can HARM YOUR BREAST GROWTH. DONT!!!!
They know of Spectrum. My mom canceled my appointment 4 months ago.
Now, that's a good life lesson right there... I could blackmail them if they try and say something...
You mean she has access to your bank account and that‚Äôs how she can see it?
If she has any questions tell her you're starting to invest in a stock/shares ISA which is probably a smart thing to do anyways.

I did something similar before I came out with a Roth IRA in the US since my mother was a cosigner on my savings account at the time, it also works fairly well as a savings account that builds interest better for me for future surgeries if I choose to use it that way (I don't know if an ISA can be used the same way though)
Huggz sister Huggz 
Becky üá®üá¶
One thing I'll note as a professional at booba ([my degree](https://imgur.com/gallery/DXg3lMJ)), is that compression can be harmful to chest growth so I suggest layering up instead assuming it's possible.

Cheers sis!
There is harm, I misgendered you on accident and now I hate myself for it, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, lmk ü•∫‚ù§
There‚Äôs no such thing as a clinic that only does HRT. Tell them you went to spectrum for an STD test or literally 100 other things.
Also, hopefully you warned the clinic about your parents so they can‚Äôt cancel your appointment again. If not, call them ASAP and do that too.
Your mother had no right to cancel your appointment. You might want to tell the clinic that you are of legal age and if your mother is on your HIPAA, you need to take the consent off your file. Meanwhile, think ahead to the future. Get copies of your birth certificate, Social Security card (or contact the appropriate offices to get copies. Password protect any programs you use with 2 factor authorization. If you are on your parents phone plan, you will want to get your own. Your excuse can be that you‚Äôre 22 and it‚Äôs time. 

And if you need to say no to your mom when she wants to borrow money, you can say no. Once you have your own account your financial information not be accessible to your parents. You can have paychecks direct deposited to your account.
Yup. Co-partnered account or whatever, ever since I started high school.
XOXO
Hey babe just so you know it‚Äôs pretty universally accepted that if you accidentally misgender someone just correct quickly and let it go, big apologies can actually be worse because it makes a big deal of it‚ù§Ô∏è
Don't sweat it. You did nothing wrong in my eyes. <3
Look at ""Spectrum: The Other Clinic"", and that will tell you otherwise. https://www.otherclinic.org/
Yeah, Stacie and Lee know the situation.
I‚Äôd get out of that if possible my uncle had toxic parents, went to the militrary to escape them and they took all his money while he was gone 

Tried to do the same to me, not that your parents would do that but I‚Äôd still have my own if given the opportunity, maybe ask your bank if they can remove the transaction listing afterwords
Making the transition (haha) to a sole bank account is a normal thing to do and doesn't need to be sus.  Teens usually have to have an adult joint signer, but once over 18 (and assuming responsible account usage, ie no falling for scammers, overdraft, etc) it's totally normal to get your own account as you get more independent.  If anyone asks, you can even say it's to help ""build your own credit"".  Manage your expenses while busy with school, yadda... and if you want to help family with expenses, it's so easy to transfer money these days without sharing accounts, through zelle, PayPal, Venmo, etc that the convenience factor of a joint account isn't required.
can you start a new bank account and transfer the money over? idrk how bank accounts work im 15, but if that is an option I feel like it‚Äôs not as suspicious if you say you want a new account since you‚Äôre older and it would be much easier and simpler to deal with financial stuff.
Also someone else here mentioned you could transfer the money to a new bank account and use that one instead I know it‚Äôs a lot of work and all this is probrobly a bit overwhelming 

 being pretty isn‚Äôt easy
Time to get them off the account friend. Or else things are gonna get much uglier than this question.
OP please _please_ set up an independent bank account, do it today if you can. You can do it casually, as if you were meaning to do it for a long time but only just got around to it.

This is important anyway but especially if there's any chance your parents could use the money as leverage over you. You have a right to privacy and it's important to be able to call on that at a moment's notice

I wish you the best if you decide coming out is the right thing to do :) (but do this first)
Go to a new bank, open an account in your name, and transfer the balance.
Then she may well already know about all of your transactions, if she‚Äôs been able to access it from the start. Hope things work out for you!!
Yeah get rid of that account and get one yourself. Provided your old enough. If not, do it the day you are old enough.
Yeah, if you‚Äôre old enough for your parents to be borrowing money from you, you‚Äôre old enough to have financial privacy.
Sorry D':
This hurts me so bad though, I'm trans and I know getting misgendered feels like getting bitch slapped in the face by a basket ball, I feel so bad about it
Find a different clinic or find a different bank. Or delay it and keep making excuses. Your call. 

Actually, find a different bank no matter what. I see too many stories in this sub about angry parents stealing their kids‚Äô cash.
That is true... I forget about paypal and that sort of thing...
I second this. Your parents shouldn‚Äôt think it to be suspicious of you to want to have a solo bank account. Especially at this moment in time. Since the money is borrowed you could bring up that you are an adult now and it‚Äôs time to get your own.
I have debated it...
Well, it's really only been this past year since I really came out...
I am 22.
That‚Äôs fair.
We‚Äôre all learning :)
You could always buy a prepaid credit card from a grocery or convenient store if setting up a bank account is too much of a hassle!
Okay, so I can't give you specific advice, mostly because I don't know your full situation and what the rules/customs are where you are.

This is what I understand based on where I live, this may vary where you are. This is the information I would give to a friend in a similar situation:

* Opening a bank account is often free
* It can often be done within half an hour (or less)
* You will likely need to show proof of address (a bill or similarly will usually do) and a form of ID (passport, driving license, etc)
* Services like Monzo allow you to open an account on your phone, without leaving the house
* Monzo even lets trans people use a preferred name instead of their legal name (I believe Citibank also allows this)
* Shared bank accounts don't guarantee access to your money, anyone on the account can access. Once it's gone, it can be very difficult (or impossible) to get it back
* It is easy to ask your employer to update the account where they deposit your wages
* It's a good idea to keep a buffer in your current (/checking) account, below which you treat as 'zero', to protect yourself from potential overdraft fees
* It is a good idea to have at least some money that only you control, even if you decide to keep a shared account with a parent, a partner, etc. So they can't restrict your access to it, for example if you needed to escape an abusive situation. In my opinion everyone (who is capable) should do this, no matter how much they trust the other person
* Lots of people continue to use the bank accounts their parents open for them, perhaps because it seems too scary or complicated to change. It doesn't need to be, and you may be missing out on good interest rates (this is a secondary benefit, your safety is the most important thing here, but it may be a good excuse)
* If you're concerned about privacy (or the environment) you can usually opt-out of statements sent by post

Apologies if there are things here you already know, or if there are other reasons that are holding you back. Again, this is not financial advice, just what I understand. 

I wish you the best of luck!

p.s I'm not recommending Monzo specifically, but I just know they're a mobile bank that's available in the UK and US. A bit of Googling should be of great benefit
Get your own bank account and you might even get 100$ by the bank for it, you are a grown adult now so you are responsible for your own safety. Parents are transphobic? You can absolutely prepare for that by taking away their power over your life!

Avoid mytransdate its a queer phobic chaser hell and u can't even date other woman there...	Gross disgusting site	"Thanks for the heads up. But I honestly avoid dating apps and everything else in general.
When I googled for trans dating sites It was like a greatest hits reel of bad gender select options
Dating sites aren't safe in general for trans people especially and also women.
I've only ever met creeps and people who wanted to just hook up instead of going on dates.
It's hard as hell but it's better to find dates irl as you're more likely to find genuine people.
That just sounds gross. This is a bit like saying ""Heads up, Slimeleech Pond is NOT a great swimming hole!""

I would have simply assumed that to be the case, but thank you for actually being the brave one and making sure for others though.
This was the sight that banned my account for looking like a man...
doesnt work for everyone, but my strategy for finding a partner is simply look where i feel most comfortable. i happened to meet a kind individual on xbox who i been besties with.  also there are lgbt sub reddits here with tons of girls (and others) who are looking for accepting  partners. i just dont see dating sites as trustworthy. i rather get with a bff then risk it with a stranger. then again thats just me. im wierd like that.
>> online dating service specifically marketed towards people who specifically seek out trans women

>> is filled with people who specifically seek out trans women (chasers) and no normal, respectful people

Took me by surprise, thats for sure!
That sounds disgusting, ty for the warning
Well i am in the site and i enjoy it.. i dont get why girls calls every guy that are into them chasers..
I- how didn't you know that before using it? Something called ""Mytransdate"" is 200% an app made by chasers for chasers- üòÖ
Good idea
>Thanks for the heads up. But I honestly avoid dating apps and ~~everything~~ everyone else in general.
Didn't expect much of it

But I am a curious whore so I went for it
Lesbians are so rare thoxD
I read stuff like this and it makes me cringe even more that my kids have used dating apps.

Have we gotten here because we're all attached to our phones? Typed on my phone ofc.
... I wasn't going to say it, but yeah. trans4chase.com  

hmm, ok
im going to slimeleech pond and gonna swim there you cant stop me
Aww I am sure u don't :/
If you have fun u go queen


But the site is problematic and banning girls because they aren't pretty enough is very hurtful, as I have read underneath my post... 



Also me as a trans woman being able to select if I am interested in pre op post op etc but not being able to view trans woman is also not speaking of much effort in the coding...
Haha yes

But someone said I could try it cuz they have seen an ad but didn't wann try it themself

So my slutty ass did it

Almost uploaded slutty pics aswell but don't want chasers to have rights of my pics... :)
I mean I don‚Äôt see it as a good idea lmao. I see it as a way to protect my self worth that I‚Äôm struggling to find. I find it as a way to not be lead on and then disappointed in the end. But that‚Äôs just me
That's trueü•∫üò≠
Maybe it'll be a better idea on just a lesbian only dating site.
Secretly hoping a coworker of mine is gay cause she's hella cute though haha
If it‚Äôs available in ur area try using HER. I‚Äôve only ran into one creep there so far and it‚Äôs pretty trans friendly from the time I‚Äôve spent on the app.
I will admit that I don't look feminine to most people. Depression makes it hard to do a lot of self care. But trans people shouldn't have to follow stereotypes to be validated.
Nah, fam, that‚Äôs EVERYONE
If she does finger guns or says ""cool beans"" then she's gay.
i can second this, also: try complimenting her with something that's almost obviously something that pretty much only someone gay would care about, like her star sign, or some other thing about her that seems gay, and if she blushes, then she's most likely gay - disclaimer for this advice: this is coming from a single lesbian with bad luck in dating, bear that in mind lol

My trans phobic family don't know what the flag looks like so I pulled a sneaky (ftm)		"What is this on? Is this a tattoo? Is this a computer background? Is this a wall?
My computers background is a trans flag disguised as a landscape
Sadly my family knows the trans flag
My aunt has the trans flag on her jacket, but doesn't know it.
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to deal with that. Nice little protest.
A Samsung phone
Nice!
mine use to be a trans flag also, but got rid of it because 'i thought you didnt like pink, now you do, that means you will wear girly pink clothes' no, but go off i guess.
Sounds cool, link?

I just had to learn from my grandma that my dad isn't accepting me	"We all live very far apart so we mostly talk on the phone. I just had a call with my grandma who I hadn't come out to yet. She said that my dad told her and she asked me a few questions but immediately tried to correct herself to use my chosen name and he/him pronouns for me, and even though she said that she will have a hard time adjusting to it and she probably doesn't fully understand it she was so nice and accepting it made me really happy. It doesn't matter if she slips up and has to correct herself every time, I'm just happy that she's trying and doesn't question my decision.

Then she told me how my dad told her and how he said that he ""isn't doing this"" and how I've ""always been his little girl and he won't adjust to it now"". Meaning he will never use my name or pronouns or see me as his son. This broke my heart. This isn't what he told me. Last year when I visited and came out to him he told me it's ok and he accepts me and understands that this is something that makes me happy. I could see that he wasn't very happy about me coming out. And when I asked him to use my name and pronouns when talking to other people he said that ""it won't be easy to do that in public"". But I still thought that... idk, it will get better and he will get used to it. We haven't talked since which I guess is one sign that he doesn't want to talk to me. But hearing from my grandma how he talked about me... Idk. I just want to be his son. And I want nothing more than to be my little brothers big brother. Him seeing me as his big brother is so important to me. But he lives with my dad so that's probably not going to happen, and his mom probably won't say anything about it since she isn't related to me. 

I don't really know what to do know. I want to talk about it to my dad but I don't know what to say. Hearing that he said those words hurts a lot and I'm scared that whatever he would say would just hurt me more.

I'm also going on T in a few weeks and he doesn't know that yet. I was going to call and tell him so he knows that my voice is going to change and that I will look differently next time I visit, and that he also can explain it to my little brother. But now Idk if I should do that anymore. I never thought I would be in this situation with him. My dad is not a conservative or LGBT+ phobic person. He used to be a punk ffs. He's probably just getting old. But I keep having dreams where he's more accepting and it just breaks my heart that he isn't, and especially that he can't say it to me directly and that I have to learn it like this.

Edit: Holy fuck there really are a lot of transphobic trolls commenting in this sub rn (deleted immediately but I have to see their shit anyway)"	"I'm sorry you're going through that. 

Think of the future though when if you're still around him a few years after starting T just use the soft overcarring voice if he misgenders you in public. ""That's right dad, your daughter,"" as someone clearly male. (/Jk sort of)
That sounds really tough and I'm sorry you're going through that. I think it's difficult to say what you should do in a situation like this, but I just hope that your dad is an otherwise levelheaded and decent person so that you *can* go to him and say you have an issue with how he's talking about you and work it out.

In the meantime, I guess you should try to draw support from the people around you who do accept you and do make an effort to affirm your gender. I don't know how old your brother is, but I hope he's old enough that you can get in touch and explain yourself to him directly, so he can understand these things from your perspective instead of your dad's.

It seems like your dad knows what he should be doing but doesn't want to do it because he finds it difficult in some way. I wonder if he would respond to you pointing out that you were brave enough to be honest with him and the others around you by telling him who you really are, and asking him if he can just be honest with you in return so you can make progress together.

If all else fails, just remember that you owe no respect to people who don't give *you* the respect they owe you. You're not duty bound or honour bound to respect your dad if he doesn't respect who you are. 

Also, bear in mind that he might be getting old, but your grandma is older, so it's clearly no excuse.

I wish you luck and success in getting better affirmation from your dad, and in helping your family understand you better. You deserve that from them.
Hey, don't worry.

He might need more time to process it. Do you have any way of talking to your brother besides your dad? Can you visit more often as to form a bond with him and explain to him that you're his brother? Try to get your dad to go to a therapy session with you if you have a gender therapist, or an lgbt parent-children support group, there are online ones ad far as i know-

I can see you love your dad very much and i understand what your going trough because my dad as well lied to my face saying he would love me either way, and now he turned around and is explicitely transphobic. I would say your dad might be too, people change, not always for the better.

In the end, this is about you and what you want to do. If you start T, and your dad doesn't like it, well, his problem, until his brain can wrap around it, he will have to stay mad, if he goes no contact, his loss, too bad he couldn't accept his own son. Focus on those who do accept you.
I'm sorry you're going through this. I'm a trans woman and my mother did not handle me coming out very well. She had been very homophobic my entire life so it was more or less what I was expecting but what I was **not** expecting was for her to completely come around over the course of six months. We live about 110 miles apart and I just kept calling her to talk casually(awkwardly is probably more apt) until I drove down to see her(or more accurately let her see me for the first time) about 6 months after I came out to her. She immediately saw me as her daughter and we sat on her bed drinking and talking for like 4 hours. It was magical. She has 100% treated me as her oldest daughter since then. Sometimes people just need time.
My notifications say I have at least three more comments on this post than I am able to see in the app. Sorry for not replying to y'all, I appreciate it
Grandmas are always very accepting and you should hang on to them. 

Your dad should eventually come around. If not. That's tough. To bad he wins the game show who's going to retirement home!
Welp no matter what, I really do think that it‚Äôll make it way harder for him to see you as your AGAB as you progress on your T journey and the voice deepens and the facial hair comes in / you get a 5 o‚Äô clock shadow. 

I suppose that‚Äôs a good thing as it will make it more natural for him to eventually come around if that hopefully does happen. üôè
Parents can be tricky for sure just try not to overextend yourself for acceptance.

My experience is I tried to do everything send parent work books, websites, videos, my own experience and he‚Äôs still stuck in his ways it hurts like shit but I can‚Äôt change someone who doesn‚Äôt want to change.
i would confront him, dear. it‚Äôll be hard but i promise it‚Äôll be relieving .
If he will even want to see me at all... I just don't want him to hate me
Thank you. I will try to talk to him soon and consider telling him what you said. My dad is a decent person but he can also be a huge asshole. I never really understood him.
Sadly no, my brother is very young and I can't really communicate with him without his parents knowing. And I live very far away and don't have much money so I can only visit very rarely. I wish I could see them more but right now it just isn't possible. And I know he can't stop me from starting T but I have to tell him somehow and I'm scared of that. He will either get angry or just sad (which is more likely) and I don't know how to deal with that or what to say.
Ayo you a lakers fan?
That's so great to hear :) It would be awesome if my dad would be like this too. I know I shouldn't, but... I envy my little brothers a lot. I want to be his son too.
True :') She probably doesn't understand half of it but she's trying her best. I love her so much.

I really hope he does. I never expected him to react like this.
Yeah I hope so
Yeah that's something that I usually do too much. But I will try to make him understand me.
I know I should... But I'm really scared of what will happen.
Hopefully he will come around. I always have those evil silly thoughts like I posted, most I'll never use but they comfort me so I share them and hope to get a smile in dark times.

My ex is slowly coming around so it's possible (kids in the picture). My father side not so much.
I don‚Äôt think he hates you. I don‚Äôt think he would have pretended he‚Äôs all accepting of everything to you if he hated you. It sounds to me like he doesn‚Äôt get it and is having difficulty accepting it but he also doesn‚Äôt want to hurt you and knew that saying that saying that to you would hurt you. It really sucks that he feels the way he feels, but it says something quite different for him to have vented about this to his mother than said it to you. Hopefully he comes around, but even if he doesn‚Äôt I highly doubt that he hates you. Stay strong man, you‚Äôve got this <3
He doesn't hate you, he's confused and afraid of the things he doesn't understand. I'm both a father to 4 children (three girls and the fourth is questioning whether or not they want to remain female or be NB) and I'm a trans mtf, and honestly, even with myself being a trans person, it was weird to hear that my child was feeling NB and wanted to get a binder.  
  
  Obviously I'm totally cool with it, it's their journey, not mine, and from the outside looking in as a parent, I don't actually think this is the right move for them, but it's my responsibility to give them the space and the support to find that out for themselves.  
  
  The difference is that your dad has zero education on what trans people actually are. In his mind, he's only thinking about how LGBTQ is indoctrinating people's children and how he lost one of his own to the evils of gayness, or whatever. And you need to recognize that this is part of his personal journey. He isn't unreachable, but he is obviously transphobic.  
  
  Transphobia has a lot of causes, but it can be overcome, and seeing someone you care about live their life as a transgender human might be the thing that helps him see that there is more than what he currently knows.  
  
  Either way, I wish you luck, and if you need to just cut ties and move on from your parents, that's unfortunately pretty normal for the trans experience.
I have difficult parents too, it might be worth drawing a line in the sand so you can be sure you're not giving too much room to him if he doesn't earn it.
I really hope it works out for you. My sister is very narcissistic and I've realized I was a bit of a doormat for her for years because of what I now recognize is envy and some other reasons. Good luck sir!
It can happen if both of y‚Äôall are trying for sure. & Sometimes it takes parents to see us change on HRT to change. I hope it happens for you.
if you‚Äôre an adult, and your sibling can maintain contact with you on his own will, then let it be what it is‚Ä¶ speaking from the perspective of someone who‚Äôs done this before and suffered the negative consequences. sometimes negative outcomes can be just as healing - if someone doesn‚Äôt love you for you it‚Äôs fair for you to cut them off. 
BUT!!! if you want to try and grow ur relationship still, that‚Äôs your choice! it may be true that over time he will become more accepting. but i‚Äôll b real w u, hiding that you‚Äôve ALREADY STARTED T will be way way worse. he‚Äôll find out everything eventually, and it probably won‚Äôt go well thag you hid it from him. it makes you out to be untrustworthy and there‚Äôs a big chance he‚Äôd make u cut contact. 
so TLDR; do what makes you feel safe, but know the consequences of either will be bad if you aren‚Äôt careful and thoughtful about jt
I wish I could do something like that lol. Doing these ""evil silly"" things always sounds so easy when it's about other people and their families. But I don't want to destroy our relationship.
Thank you. I will try to explain it to him but honestly I'm just extremely bad at talking to people and bringing up good arguments. I always avoid situations like that because I know I will loose the argument no matter what. But I guess I will try. I just never expected him to be like that. And I already lost my mom because she was toxic and I had to cut her out of my life (for other reasons). I don't want to loose my dad and my little brothers as well
I should probably do that. Ugh, I'm so bad at these things.
Oh I agree, if a relationship can be salvaged don't ruin it
Take your time. Life is much longer than it feels like at your age. While a few months, or a couple years of tension with your dad might feel like a lot, after ten years or more, you will have a whole different relationship. Whether that means he'll be able to learn and embrace you, or if you'll have created more distance, I cannot say for sure.  
  
  You don't need to push an education on him immediately. Spend more time learning about yourself, and other trans people as a whole. There is an ASAP Science video on YouTube you can search that gives a good scientific explanation for how certain genetic codes in our DNA can misrepresent what body we have, even though our biological gender was assigned differently. It's a very common problem, since technically the male chromosome is a mutation anyway and everyone is more XX than XY.  
  
  Just don't expect to have all the answers now, or that the problems will be resolved on their own. The best thing you can do is just embrace the journey, bad and good. The fact your dad has at least hidden his negative opinions means that he cares enough not to outwardly hate you, and I doubt you will lose him or anyone else in your family right now.  
  
  Again, just try to understand that while this is hard for you, this is also hard for him.. but never forget that you are right and he is just misinformed. That you know and must remain true to yourself, and that he just simply does not know how to be anything else yet.  
  
  Good luck. My DMs are always open if you hit a tight spot on the path.
I mean that's fair enough in itself. Our circumstances may not be the same, but when I drew a line in the sand and explained the consequences of crossing it to my parents, they immediately crossed it and I haven't really talked to them since. Best decision I ever made, but that's also a consequence of who my parents are (and who they are is why the consequence for them crossing that line was so steep).

You migt find it best to draw a shallow line and give a shallow but natural consequence at first - for example, you could say ""I need you to start calling me by my real, chosen name and use my real, chosen pronouns in public, or I won't go out in public with you anymore/as often.""

This can be useful because the fact that the consequence follows directly from the boundary means that it's more obviously reasonable and harder to boundary-creep past. Cause in reality, the natural consequence of being misgendered or deadnamed in public by someone is to not want to be in public with them, for a lot of people. If you find you have a different natural reaction to that circumstance, it might be best to reflect on that to help you decide what consequence you'll enforce.

The other reason this is useful is because you get to reclaim power of the situation - suddenly you're talking about consequences, and no matter what anyone does they're consequences you have the power to enact, so people will either respect your boundaries or face those consequences, and there's very little they can do about it (which is as it should be, just like there's very little you can do about how they make you feel when they cross that boundary).

Symmetry is an indication of healthy boundaries, but it's far from the only one, so feel free to do whatever you see as reasonable.

And finally, remember, you're the minority defending yourself here, your dad is being biggotted and disrespectful, so you needn't feel any guilt over him facing those consequences. It's not like they aren't natural for you to enact, it's not like he won't have fair warning, and it's not like he's in the right to begin with.

If there's anything else you want to talk through surrounding this, I'm happily available to do so here or in DMs :)

Also, a good resource on drawing healthy boundaries and dealing with people who don't treat you right is TheraminTrees' YouTube channel. It's centred on abuse and provides therapeutic advice for dealing with abuse, but whether that's a label you feel applies or not, he explains many healthy approaches to dealing with unhealthy interpersonal situations of various kinds. Approach it with skepticism about whether it applies to your situation though, I don't know how your dad or family act outside of what you've explained here and am not indicating that those behaviours are or are not abusive, since I feel underinformed about that.
Thank you, this really helps. I'll keep it in mind."	u458s6	trans	192	0.95	2022-04-15 10:42:25
School called and told my grandparents I‚Äôm trans when I specifically told them they‚Äôre trans phobic.	I emailed my school saying call me luna with she/her pronouns and specific stated in the email that my grandparents are transphobic, please don‚Äôt call them and tell them. They call them right after I got out of school and told my grandparents everything! I‚Äôm so upset, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I just want to be myself	"Happened with me, someone I asked to call me by name (Elliot) when to the school counselor and she ""gave an option"" of telling my parents or they would tell them (reads:  Threatened me).

She said she would give me until next day, but 2 hours later she called my mom, I had to sit my mom down and try to explain to her but as always our conversation was just me trying to talk, her getting mad and sad and then pretending it never happened 

The counselor in question is a fanatic Christian right wing homphobe and transphobe

I'm so sorry this happened to you
What country are you in? If you're in the EU this is explicitly illegal.
that's fucked.
I know there isn't gonna be a next time, but for those who read this and may be in this situation. Make sure you explicitly stress that you will not be safe. Your goal is to make them feel that telling your parents or legal guardians will put you in real danger. Explain to them that they will physically harm you if they know, kick you out, or anything else. The school will be very hesitant upon hearing that as it means that they would be putting you in harms way. 

It's like when you call the hospital. Always lead with your worst problems. If you get in a car accident, don't start with: ""Yeah, I got a light headache in an accident."" You start with: ""I got in an accident and am in pain.""
That is so wrong! I‚Äôm really sorry and hope they will be supportive. Do you live in Arkansas by chance? They are doing some crazy stuff!
Do you have a support network? Find people who will support and help you, and stay safe
you're school administration isnt an ally. they use she/her to avoid lawsuits and firings. im sorry they outted u. i've been outted to mine b4. it sucks.
As a teacher in a conservative-ish state I‚Äôm horrified that this happened to you. It‚Äôs unfortunate that in several conservative states (I.e. Florida and Texas) teachers/counselors/admin are legally required to disclose trans identities to families. It‚Äôs beyond fucked up and if that happens here I will be refusing to comply. 

Another comment suggested reaching out to the ACLU and that is correct. If the person/people you told at your school are not affirming (which I‚Äôm assuming is the case because people who affirm would never do this) then the ACLU is your best bet. 

I hope you can find peace and acceptance soon with all of this :(
If that‚Äôs not illegal, it fucking should be
Im so sorry that happened, I dont have much advise bc you‚Äôre US, but just want to make sure you know that what they did is not okay and shouldn‚Äôt have happened to you. You deserve to both have your identity respected, and your need for privacy respected. I hope you have some supportive friends around you ‚ù§Ô∏è
That sounds like a lawsuit fren... they legit put you in potential danger. That's unacceptable
I remember in 8th grade my hardcore Christian parents getting a phone call from my teacher saying I was playing dungeons and dragons because she saw I had a paperback fantasy book I would read with me during lunch. (Ridiculous as playing D&D and reading a book are completely unrelated). Then getting home to my dad threatening to ‚Äúbeat the shit out of me‚Äù if he ever heard about me playing dungeons and dragons again. Such love and understanding. Gee I wonder why I never told them I was uncomfortable about my gender. Schools, teachers, and admin are typically not your friends or allies even though they pretend they are.
Can you get in touch with your state ACLU and see if they can do anything?
[removed]
Oh wow I'm so sorry they violated your trust in this way! Where do you live? This is totally crap and I'm so sorry! Did it go okay at home?
I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. I have been here too and I know it sucks. ü´Ç
I'm so sorry to hear to is happened luna! You deserve to be yourself and have your privacy respected.
Sue their asses! They explicitly ignored your wishes and potentially put your housing and life at risk! Call the ACLU
Lawsuit. They violated your privacy and express wishes and did so without your consent.
Your second par my mom did this to me she has done it like 10 times now and I was so close to talking to her then she yelled at me so I didn‚Äôt then ran upstairs and cried in the shower for 45 minutes help
(Cw self harm mention)

I was writing a note to my friend about my SH in 8th grade and the counselor did the same thing. Gave me ab option to tell them myself and then a couple hours later call me down and my mom is sitting there. Why give me an option in the first place??
It's absolutely disgusting. It seems that confidentiality means nothing when you happen to be Trans.
I‚Äôm in the US
This is helpful! Thanks!
No, I live in Illinois - I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre doing some bad things down there
I live in a very rural and small town, it‚Äôs hard for me to find many things like that.
It sucks I had to learn it this way tbh
Why would you come on a trans page to shit on trans experiences?
No, it didn‚Äôt. They were extremely angry.
<3
Our important talks are always like this, me getting overwhelmed because I can't explain the thing, her getting mad and interrupting, me ending up crying 

And then she forgets it ever happened but then later uses it in a fight 

I love her so much but it's tiring because we always end up colliding since we have similar personalities
Exactly, its just a intimidation tactic to make us feel scared and also to take us by surprise and be on the parents good graces (the bad ones at least) for telling them about ""something their child would've lied to them about""
Unfortunately yes
You‚Äôre very young and it‚Äôs unfair we have to advocate for ourselves‚Ä¶ but i‚Äôd ask you to make a written complaint to the school informing them of the dangerous situation they put you in disclosing your personal medical information without consent‚Ä¶ When I say the school, I don‚Äôt mean your teacher, I mean the management or local authority who manages the school.
I think the school bored will still be very upset with thwm
Yes, now the non-binary word Latinx has been banned. Gendered Latino or Latina must be used. Drag shows and anyone dressed in clothing not of their birth gender cannot perform in public for more than an audience of two. Trans kids will violate this if acting in a  school play or choir concert! They already banned gender affirming healthcare for minors but it is being challenged in court. Outing students to parents too.
plus you're still stuck at home. its not like college where you can be more open about transition (depending on your state/province)
I was checking thier comment logs to figure that out. Def cringe.
Ik right I would scream at her if I didn‚Äôt want to keep the family okay

Unfortunately in some states in the us it‚Äôs required for schools to do this, and even in states where it‚Äôs not there‚Äôs no legal protection for lgbt minors. Most people are considerate enough to not say anything, but a lot of people arent
I'm not in Oklahoma, but have you seen the proposed bill to make being trans before 26 illegal, making hormones for any reason a felony with a 40 year statute of limitations and they will forceably detransition anyone who say gets in a car accident in their state while passing through, if you get hospitalized they will fuck up your shit with this bill...Don't Oklahoma kids
I just give up at screaming what I feel because I depend on her a lot and I know she feels bad and cries later 

But also because it's not worth it I won't be out of home now, I still have to wait 2 to 3 years
I'm sorry, hope you can get better with time and get the mental care you need
Yes, I have. I think the new bill in Kansas or Kentucky  is age 26. I also understand day before yesterday that Oklahoma filed a bill that will ban medical providers from being able to get reimbursed from insurance for ALL ages of people that provide gender affirming healthcare.  I fear medical providers will just stop providing it and people won‚Äôt be able to afford care without the use of  insurance benefits. I doubt this is constitutional. I‚Äôm hoping the decision in the Arkansas case, that should be forthcoming, will help in some of these instances.
You should not have to be your parents parent. You‚Äôre still a kid your mom is not. I know it doesn‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs any other options and there might not be but just remember that it shouldn‚Äôt have to be like that.

Online: Blocking them. I don't have the patience.

IRL: Not saying anything, but disengaging from the conversation. I've only ever gotten transphobia irl from family members so I can't exactly curse them out or cut them off completely, but I just interact as little as possible afterward.

If I got anything from a stranger irl I'd probably either ignore them or just tell them to go die. I'm honestly too tired for anything complicated lmao
What is a man/woman, then slowly dismantle everything they say.
Rickroll them
""I'm sorry you feel that way.""
Ducking eye contact and walking away because I like remaining alive
Walk away, if they ask where you‚Äôre going, respond with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna show your dad how to use a condom‚Äù
My go to reaction is to act somewhat confused and then ignore them, it‚Äôs their problem not yours
""ur so far in the closet ur in Narnia""
Just look at them with a straight face and ask them ‚Äúdid you mean to say that out loud? That‚Äôs embarrassing‚Äù then walk away 
Shame can go a very long way
Depends on the type of transphobe. If they hate for the sake of hating, then either complete non-chalance (""ok"") or completely ignore their argument (after all, they'll only ignore mind) and instead grade their comments like an English professor. If they're simply unknowing, then try to help them learn.
""Oh, what a horrible person you are. I'll pray for you.""
I used to just smack transphobes across the face (which was quite effective) but the school said I can‚Äôt do that anymore lol. Glad they didn‚Äôt expel me my principal is a straight G
I have low vision so people say they‚Äôll never see me as a woman. I usually say that‚Äôs ok. I don‚Äôt see you anyway, it usually diffuses problems
Takes one to make one
""Ok""
I‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre hurting, friend. I know that what you‚Äôre saying is not really about me rather it‚Äôs about you. I hope you find healing.
'I am going to hell but it's got nothing to do with my gender.'
Have you really got such a sad and disappointing existence that making fun of someone is the only way you can find happiness?!

its a simple spell, but quite unbreakable
If I actually respond to it I tend to drop this.

"" Don't you have anything better to do?  My body my choice and your prejudice has no weight on that.""
I carry a sword aroumd now. That helpa
You know what?! All i have to do is outlive you(then walk away) if they report what you said just gaslight em
Look directly in their eyes ""why would you say something like that?"" they usually claim its a joke, so I follow up with ""I'm not laughing. I'm disappointed in you."" and then walk away.
The best comeback I‚Äôve ever done was fucking the woman‚Äôs boyfriend I was at a bar and she was insulting me later that night I called a taxi and he saw her and was like oh that‚Äôs my girlfriend and I was like hmmm interesting so I hit on him and we fucked in the taxi
MtF here, women typically leave me be but for men I just say ""Oh I'm sorry, did I make your penis tingle?"". Be preprared though, those be fightin words.
Laugh. Show them i‚Äôm not offended. Don‚Äôt stoop to their level.
I don‚Äôt really get them in public. Generally when I do one look is enough to get them to back down. Could also be the katana that‚Äôs usually across my back, couldn‚Äôt say.
There are 2 types of people in this world, good people and then there is you.

Outsourcing problems I don‚Äôt have time for
If someone says ""I will never see you as a man/woman. "" 
Shoot back with ""I've never seen you as a man/woman"" 
Or a recording for hr, whatever works best.
Honestly my favorite is to imply that something about them is weird or unnatural. Along the lines ""you say that with your nose"" or ""at least my ears are even"". Something specific and innocuous.

 People who attack others are terrified of anything they find weird so if you hit them right they will be self conscious for a while.
""funny, I don't remember having gender with your mom last night""
""if what's in my pants makes me who I am then you must be an asshole"" just seems funny to me
Well I‚Äôve only used it once but when someone calls me fruit because I‚Äôm flamboyant I say bitch I‚Äôm the whole salad
""Gender is what's in your pants!""
""...So my gender is your mom?""
‚ÄúUr mad that I got shapeshifting abilities and u doooonnntttt‚Äù
I usually repeat ""huh?"" or ""what?"" over and over until I get bored of them repeating themselves like an idiot and ignore them.
Nice name, did your mom pick it out for you?
Nice gender, did your mom pick it out for you?

Try to ignore, it is often best to not engage at all.
they used to call them jump-olines before your mum used one
I dont think there are any, even if you do they'll flame you back
I just ignore them. I don‚Äôt like talking to those types of people.

RELIGIOUS LINK & POTENTIAL COMMON PHOBIC STATEMENTS WARNING - To those religious, facing 'religion-based' phobic remarks	"Just a reminder that;

- If your body is a 'gift', it no longer belongs to the one(s) that granted it - it is yours to own, to adapt.
- If you were *made* in someone else's image, surely that'd be temporary - you have the freedom to become your own image.
- If any divine presence is 'incapable of making mistakes', but you view incorrect biological assignment a 'deity's mistake' (rather than only incorrect social assignment), certainly 'everyone makes mistakes' applies to the one(s) we're built on the image of?

On a similar note, if it 'isn't natural' how did it happen? Try to genuinely think of a solid answer to that.

While not being wholly religious myself, I do still get these things. I'm not sure how much they can get to some religious people, but these are some counters to what I hear.

There is undoubtedly support in what/whoever you believe.

üíú"	"Their Christian based view of trans people only reminds me that their religion has been transphobic and hating fellow humans for 2,000 years and counting.
You know what is ""natural""? Dying from dysentery when you're 27 because you ate the wrong berries or uncooked meat or drank stagnent water.
>If you were made in someone else's image, surely that'd be temporary - you have the freedom to become your own image.

Or, for a particularly fun reaction, ""their image"" must then be open to Trans and intersex bodies. üòä
I'd say it's less 'their religion' and more 'people who believed certain ""authority"" and decided to push that into their other beliefs' - a socialisation loop to bring it as 'just another religious belief' so their kids would take the same information in - really most original religious stuff is basically flipping the current 'religiously-linked hatred'.

One of the last things I want from this post is generalising a full religion and its 'entire history' as something full of hatred.

Christened Protestant, schooled Catholic, raised for my own decision by Pagan & Atheist - then again nobody is seeing all of the history of any single religion no matter how hard they look into every one of them, but while Christianity itself has quite a lot of up & down mess around it, I'd hate to say it's 'the religion'.
This is the future the Republicans want
I don't. I am not a believer. Never have been. They say it is their religion. They cite passages from their book to attack my existence. They have been doing this my entire life.
Well, if they're wrong about trans people, what foundation have they to say they're right about an entire religion?

It's funny how they need to quote someone they don't know the name of and their additions to a book that has been adjusted time and time again to feel right.

I am not saying religion is 'not true' when I say this, but...
Surely if they wanted to back their point up, they should choose anything other than *one of the most 'factually disputed' and heavily edited scriptures to exist*.

There are many things religious texts can be pulled up for, especially if the one on the other end is also of similar beliefs, but 'exceptions to human rights & nature' ain't one of em. Can't tell me to forgive the one I am 'wired to hate the most' but hate someone just trying to be themselves, can ya?

Religious beliefs are only valid when they're *beliefs that come from a religion*, not *beliefs that are pushed 'into a religion' so people can back their points up with it*.

It's like *putting* a knife next to a burnt fly to back up the belief that the fly was stabbed.
Just many words to explain why a religion has hate for other humans. A hate that has been used throughout my life. This has been going on for thousands of years.

I am tired of all of this.

Amab trans woman struggling with male expectations pushed on me as a youth	"Growing up and as a young adult one of the things that upsets me and has angered me a lot is the idea that since I was born as male and seen that way by my phobic parents they sort of made me do things they would expect boys/men to. Like being physically tough, doing labor intensive work. It gives me mad dysphoria.

The weird part about this is that it almost sounds like I‚Äôm embracing gender stereotypes and gender roles but I‚Äôm not. After having to live with male expectations pushed on me for so long I personally would like to be treated as a princess, to be ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù, to not have to do grueling laborious work, to be showered with support/love/reassurance that I‚Äôm cared for.

Does anyone here relate or if not at least get what I mean?"	"I get what you mean, from the opposite perspective. It's not that I was ever treated like a princess, or expected to find a man that would - but there were expectations such as being the one that made dinner, keeping the house tidy and clean, have my job be pretty secondary to whatever guy I was with - it was truly an odd mix between parents wanting me to do good in school and getting a nice job/career, but at the same time be ""the wife"" - my (boomer) father pretty much lost it that I was away more hours than my then-fianc√©, although he was also the one that bragged most about my job. 

On the other hand, there was also the whole thing that it was my then-fianc√©'s job to do all the other hard work, men taking heavy bags from me, that sort of stuff. 

I've become pretty allergic to gender stereotypes, and learned to say ""fuck those, I do what I want"" long before I came out as transmasc. That doesn't mean that doing manly things can't make me euphoric though. They are just things I've wanted to do without it feeling odd or quirky or questioned every single time. 

I don't see it as falling to gender stereotypes as much as there is a reason certain things ARE stereotypes. It is because, if we look at the population as a whole, certain things, interests, traits, are just more commonly found in women than in men and vice versa. 

Since you are a woman, you are just *more likely* to have a desire for certain things that are considered typical womanly.

On top of that, we've fought tirelessly against these stereotypes for so long. They didn't fit us, they were wrong for us, or we wanted to be like the other side - conscious or not - so now that we allow ourselves to fully be ourselves and have fully stomped on all expectations that came with our AGAB - we just wish to go full out. We just have a lot of catching up to do.

If being spoiled is what you want, there's nothing wrong with that. It's not you embracing gender stereotypes. That's just you being you, finally, unashamed and unabashed.
A random older man helped me downstairs at a party I was just at. I was wearing heels and he held his arm out and offered to assist me down the stairs. I know I didn‚Äôt need his help, but‚Ä¶ I took his offer enthusiastically. 

I love being treated like a lady! It makes me glow. 

OP, I was raised to be the gentleman. I get it and agree wholeheartedly.
That‚Äôs the feeling most of us older ladies have, growing up with that era. Just be true to yourself and you will definitely feel better eventually. I know that I am finally finding my happy place after 40 years. It takes time and self reflection to get there, but it is truly worth it.
I think a lot of us can relate. You‚Äôre not alone.
I feel so much pressure all the time. I did exceptionally well in college and now also am getting promoted very fast in my engineering job. Everyone sees that and thinks I must be thriving to be able to so well but it feels so isolating to me. I‚Äôm struggling a lot internally and I cope by pouring energy into work and math problems so I can forget about my dysphoria. My psych says ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to believe you have anything debilitating going on‚Äù because my job performance is not suffering.

My roommates in college jokingly called me Princess all the time because I was usually late and people were waiting on me‚Ä¶ and deep down I loved it even though I was still treated as male. 

I have been literally begging people irl to listen to me and help me because I feel incredibly anxious and everybody just sees it as me opening the door to talk about THEIR problems because they think I can handle it and nothing is really bothering me. I want so much to just be treated like a girl and have emotional expectations where I am believed when I say I‚Äôm stressed out. Everything is expected to be my responsibility as a ‚Äústrong man‚Äù and I absolutely hate that.
Your trying to chase after any and all femininity after being denied it for so long, not surprising to see happen.

I am sortive had that issue but nipped that thought in the bud by reminding myself my sisters were all tomboyish like so no need to be something I don‚Äôt need to be, can be happy being a tomboy like my sisters if need be.

Then again‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt stop me from getting dresses and wanting more so idk>.>
I get what you mean but I‚Äôm the opposite, I am a trans man and I was lucky to find my soulmate he loves being spoiled, and I‚Äôm happy to let him stay home to be a streamer while I‚Äôm the bread winner.
AMAB agender queer here.
I've embraced my ability to do it all. It has nothing to with gender for me, it's just my ability to learn tasks and compete.
I'm tall, thicc, femme, and strong. Most people have no idea what to call me.
I too crave the soft things, someone to cuddle up with, someone to treat me like a queen and tell me everything is alright.
Baby it's what we all want. You're not strange for wanting it. It's human! We all want someone to take care of us, to pamper us, to spoil us with the things that make us happy.
You're a powerful creature of incredible potential. Embrace it all!
I only recently realized that I‚Äôm trans at 30 after missing all the signs growing up. Yes, I wanted to not do guy stuff. I never longed for girl activities because I wasn‚Äôt exposed to them
There are already a lot of great responses here, but absolutely! Personally, I can 100% relate to what you described. When I was younger I fulfilled very masculine roles and engaged in ""manly"" norms. I did tons of labor for my parents and employement, I played heavy contact sports in school, my roles in relationships was always the stoic caretaker. My hobbies and interests were typical of masculine individuals my age. I know where you're coming from and how that can feel. It's really hard to shed those expectations, ESPECIALLY when they're internalized and coming from inside. You can't just ignore a rude family member or rando at the store, it's you.

Remember to show yourself kindness, give yourself time to reframe those internalized expectations, remind yourself that those messages aren't true for everyone, and you'll be right as rain, girl. Wishing you the best üíõ
I feel the same- I used to think I hated formal environments, then I realized I wanted to be in dresses and treated chivilrously. I was raised as a ‚Äúgentlemen‚Äù to, expected to be manly and stuff. i get it entirely.
I was AMAB and didn't figure it out for almost 28 years. Since then, a big portion of my life has been spent finding thing after thing that I had no reason to believe or support except for societal pressure and general opinion. The amount of positivity I've discovered and self-improvement I have made on both my body and mind has been staggering in perspective to those first 28 years. When you encounter something that makes you upset, ask yourself if you are thinking or doing that thing because society wants you to or has just taught you that things are just this way versus you actually wanting to do the thing. Re-examine aspects of your life and values and choose the ones that create the most happiness for yourself. Worry about the happiness of those around you after you have taken care of yourself.

Stereotypes exist for a reason and are not automatically bad. They are bad when they are used to mock someone or something such as a culture but stereotypes used in their literal sense often reflect some level of popular opinion or preference. After exploring myself have found many things that are female stereotypes that have brought me amazing Joy. There's no reason not to enjoy something just because it is something that stereotypical girls do. Do what you think is right and what feels good to you short of directly harming someone else. And remember that even though many of the haters cry that we are ruining them, their way of life, and their values, you are not causing anyone harm because they can't accept you for who you are.
The amount of stress and anxiety I had about portraying myself as masculine literally ate away at my body. The 2 years before I came out I had constant tension headaches, I had lost over 60 lbs (200 to 140 lbs), I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I had a seizure, and my muscles started to atrophy to the point where I couldn‚Äôt lift more than 40 lbs

Once I came out and stopped pretending to be masculine these things quickly went away.
I absolutely relate. Unfortunately, my apartment complex does not, so off to work I go
Yes!  Honestly I was taught to open doors and let women, children and older folks go first.  I was taught to be a leader, be loud and heard, to make my presence known, to be strong, and show no fear.

As a trans woman who has been out a year and is a technical lead in the workplace.  Some of these lessons have turned me into a very strong leader who is highly respected.  Other parts absolutely destroyed and confused the woman inside of me, and made it so much harder to come out and finally transition.  Fortunately emotionally I have gotten over many of these weird lessons.

But I have to say... its still really weird when I insist an older gentleman go first... and they ABSOLUTELY insist that no I have to go first, or they have to open the door.  Its so affirming but so weird for me still!
I relate to that a lot because I was raised by mormons. I was literally sent to gender brainwashing camps with strict sexist segregation. It really made me feel like I had to be a girl in order to have access to all the things I enjoy. I felt guilty about wanting to be the kind of woman I was and I found 2 things that helped me out a lot. I found that separating my feelings of wanting to be a princess from my gender was really helpful with dysphoria. I want to be who I am, as a woman and not that who I am is because I'm a woman.
And knowing that tons of ciswomen everywhere look for the same kind of attention as I'm looking for and that it's our responsibility as women to let societies image of us affect us as much or as little as it needs to, to go live in this world.

Knowing both of these things helped me embrace my femininity and even made me more comfortable doing traditionally masculine things without dysphoria. It gave me a whole new perspective as to what nonbinary people might experience the world like too. I started identifying as more of a demi-girl femby now that I'm confidently feminine in my own style.
I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm an older lady. But I‚Äôm 27? I of course get that for most people under capitalism, everyone has to work for a living. That‚Äôs not a gendered thing..But that‚Äôs not what I meant. I was talking more about like the type of work I‚Äôm expected to do.. does that make sense?
I‚Äôm envious ü•∫
Yeah.. I still have to work to pay my rent unfortunately  because capitalism.. but at least the job I now work at is not like a typical male expected labor intensive job in the hot sun that always left me exhausted all day that I was expected to do before when I lived with my parents. I know if I was afab I would not have been forced to do that while living with parents.
Like in other words I of course understand that almost everyone has to work‚Ä¶ but I was more talking about the type of work‚Ä¶
Thank you everyone for the beautiful responses and validation. Love you all üíù
Totally makes sense. I‚Äôm actually looking at changing careers from my original career due to not being comfortable in that environment any more. But I already was looking at changing careers before my egg cracked."	y8vtde	trans	79	0.97	2022-10-20 11:35:30
How is everyone handling the recent crazy increase in transphobia?	"tw: transphobia 


I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just my algorithms bumping phobic comments, or if maybe I‚Äôve just been more sensitive recently, but my socials have been inundated with transphobia and TERFs. 

It seems like everywhere I look there‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs disgusted by me and thinks I deserve to die for just existing. I‚Äôve been getting more stares and glares in public. I actually had to delete twitter because reading through comments was affecting my mental health so badly.

It‚Äôs obviously never been great, but I feel like it‚Äôs gotten much worse in the past 3-4 years, especially with the increase in anti-queer legislation (in the US). I don‚Äôt feel safe in public anymore, and I live in a fairly liberal area.

It just feels like no one cares about us, and those that do actively despise us. Has anyone else noticed this? How are y‚Äôall dealing with it?"	"It really does seem like things are worse. Obviously, there are a myriad of laws being passed in the USA and other places to take away our bodily autonomy. We are currently the target of a large, global-reaching fascist reactionary movement. They hate us and also they think that we are an ""acceptable target"" and that they can convince others we are dangerous.

I think it's important to remember that our laws are not really representative of what people think. I've noticed a huge increase in anti-trans sentiment online, but when you start to look into the numbers of, for example, TERF accounts, or at protests against trans rights, you'll start to see that there is a lot of astroturfing going on. A lot of the TERF noise comes from bots, or people who are prolific transphobic posters, but there aren't actually all that MANY of them. Transphobic actors are being extremely loud and in your face right now, which gives the perception that this kind of violent transphobia is ""the norm.""

Here on reddit you can see it a lot in the major, default subreddits especially. Right-wing fascists astroturf reddit all the time. We saw it with the\_donald in 2016, we see cops do it in local city subs like clockwork after some police brutality is brought to light.

Now, i'm not saying that these people are not dangerous and that their laws have no effect. It's true: our community is under grave attack, and most people don't seem to care. But try to remember that these people WANT you to feel afraid and alone, like the world is against you. These fascists are not popular outside their circles. They rely on the perception of themselves as ""what everyone thinks but is afraid to say"" in order to be taken seriously.
A candle burns brightest before it goes out.
I wish that me being trans was infectious like Covid for like a month. I'd just go kiss a few haters and see how they like what they see in the mirror.  All we want to do is just be comfortable in our own skin and share our joy.
No change for me here in Canada honestly.  I‚Äôm pretty obviously trans but haven‚Äôt got any rude looks or comments.
Buying another gun
i honestly haven't really seen any increase (just the regular amount üò©) BUT i am not on twitter (and refuse to be bc quite frankly it's a cesspit... tho i've held this opinion for at least a decade now) and am fast on the block button. vibes slightly off? block. someone sharing things from someone i don't like or even don't care about? block. pretty much, if something bugs me, i block and move on, i don't have the emotional energy to deal with nonsense on the internet.

so yeah... not something i've noticed, but i attribute it to well curated dashboards. i hope it eases up for you and you start to see less of it in your online spaces üíö
Staying in Brooklyn and depersonalization.

Watching US politics from here feels kind of like being queer in Berlin in 1930, but I don't know any safer place I can go. I just have to hope that the city stays relatively safe even when everything else is burning.

I'm in as privileged and safe a position as I think I possibly can be. Things here haven't changed much. It feels unreal, like watching a movie.

I transitioned a long time ago and am semi-stealth. I'm working on closing up any remaining documents that could out me, as much as is possible. I submitted the forms to update my birth certificate (3rd attempt, last two rejected on bullshit reasons), and I'm trying to lock down medical and insurance records. I may try to hire a lawyer to see what else I can do.

I don't know how much of a difference it'll make, but at least it gives me something to do.
Not well. I feel trapped and isolated and im putting together a plan to flee the US if it becomes necessary. It's taken a massive toll on my mental health which was already pretty shit. Im struggling to take care of myself already and feeling like the whole country is trying to suffocate me has made things like hygiene extremely difficult. Mostly it's just depressing and i'd be lying if I said I haven't had some concerning thoughts. Im safe and im definitely not going to hurt myself, and I hope no one else does either, but it's been a bit tough mentally.
Literally the ONLY reason i‚Äôm still in the closet is because of transphobia. I‚Äôm terrified that republicans will take power in 2024.
my reaction to the growing amount of transphobia? i am revolting, resisting, rebelling, i am going out and protesting, being loud and being seen and noticed, questioning the set up, the who and the what and the reasons why, we shall overcome, they can‚Äôt kill us all, and if they do get me, i‚Äôm going out fighting for me, for you and for every other trans and queer person and every minority, i have zero tolerance for intolerance
Not well tbh. I live in Tennessee and recently decided to get some basic personal protection.
Things are legitimately getting worse. More and more Republicans are proposing or passing anti trans legislation. 

You aren't imagining it. I think it's tied to the resurgence of fascism happening as economic conditions worsen. 

When corporate greed starts to suffocate the common people, our politicians will look to place the blame on a minority group. Looks like we're that group. 

I don't think it's going to get any better. Currently democrats are upping police spending, the looming cop city in Atlanta is a tell of what's to come; we will let corporations choke out the public and when they try to stand up, our militarized police will put them down. Us trans people are being used as a release valve, a scapegoat for the common person to redirect their hate towards. 

Over the years we've gotten more rights and visibility, over the years your dollar buys less and less, the politicians connect the two so they can protect the greedy corporations.
I've been spending a lot less time on Twitter lately. I have a timer on it and have been using Reddit more often since it's easier to curate your feed. It doesn't cross my mind very often day to day when I'm offline. There are a lot of people who care about trans people or are indifferent to them, they're just quieter than bigots. We'll get through it. ü§û
honestly my life sucks, they\['re winning idk i have no fight left
i‚Äôve had to go half-undercover as binary trans since i‚Äôm transmasc and on T so i pass as male. just hunkering down my gnc self for a little while lol but i‚Äôm comfortable. very privileged to have a good doctor and live in a blue state but the trans healthcare bans really do keep me up at night
I just remember that it‚Äôs just transphobes getting more vocal, not there being more transphobia (more people support trans rights than ever right now) and have frequent panic attacks.
It's been pretty terrible lately, not gonna lie.
But it's subtle enough that it's got me questioning myself sometimes. 

Though even by those who aren't aware I'm trans... the conversation and disgust keep propping up.
Extremely aware of my privilege as a Western European. 

As a freshly cracked egg, very worried for people I only just discovered kinship with and a community I never knew I had. 

Terrified of it wafting over from that shithole military corporate complex of a third world country like covid-denialism and alt-right conspiracies did.
So so poorly I‚Äôm becoming so fucking depressed and dysphoria is through the fucking roof
Trans rights have been increasingly gaining space so the bigots have also been on the rise, but it is definitely easier to be a trans person today than it was 100 years ago. I am Brazilian btw and violence against trans ppl here has always been high so at least now we also have a rise in visibility, opportunities and human rights.
It‚Äôs been super frustrating seeing the rise in transphobia over the years. For me, I didn‚Äôt actually directly experience an increase of hate or discrimination until I suddenly got fired from my last job for no reason. I worked with kids & tried to look as gay as possible w my work uniform, and I was really looking out for the trans kids. The school (and district - it went all the way to the top) really didn‚Äôt like what I was doing bc I was directly challenging their transphobia. They actually kept making up false reasons as to why they fired me months after it happened. Now, I‚Äôm stealth at my current job to avoid a similar thing from happening.
As usual, the minority is making all the noise (and passing some awful bills) but the majority of people are not transphobic like the media makes it seem.  It really is moving in the right direction and, like right wing extreme conservatism, is in its death spiral.
Meh, I'm not worried. I haven't noticed any increase in transphobia, if anything there's less than ever because we're more visible so people realize we're just normal humans like everyone else.
It has definitely been ramping up for me too, im honestly kinda frightened. But I‚Äôve already emotionally decided to leave where I am living a few months ago so that gives me a but of an emotional safety net
I feel like the amount of transphobia hasn't changed at all. There's a saying between my family, ""don't come out to companies,"" it basically means that if an algorithm learns something about you, it means that it's going to apply that to your ads, recommended, everything. 

If you have actively posted about being trans before, then services are gonna show you things relating to transgenderism, positive or negative, because what the service wants is activity, it wants you to be interested, engaged, in whatever's happening. It is possible that there's an increase, but I doubt transphobia randomly exploded.

Weirdly, social media often discourages harassment and bad things. But then it'll show you what people--or you-- hate, almost doing the opposite.

Take YouTube for example. In terms of how their screwed-up algorithm works, *any activity means more recommendations.* If a viewer dislikes a video, it has the same effect if they like it: it's likelihood of being recommended to other users increases.

Simply put, it really is true that any attention is good attention. Some people know this, and exploit it by ruining their reputation so that when people click on their channel or account or whatever, just to leave a bad comment or make fun of them, they still get money.

&#x200B;

*Don't come out to companies!*
There is just so much discourse happening around transness and I feel like I know so many more trans people than I did like 6 years ago.
Poorly. I'm pretty scared for the future most of the time and I consider giving up quite frequently. Doesn't help that I'm basically alone haha
Not well having mental breakdown :D
Delete Twitter now bc *Elon-Fuckin-Musk* is a raging transphobe. He mocks his own trans daughter and she went to court to legally separate from him, saying that she never wants anything to do with him again. 

Courage over money. Life over death. We cannot let the fascist transphobes win.
Barley go be honest. I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm just blessed to be where I am

I truly hope we're not in an age of ""first they came for the queers...""
ive noticed that too and wondered if it was just me.  i think it‚Äôs getting worse. :/
Funny what you're saying about cops. Geographical context is important, I'm a Queensland transwoman, I'm friends with an American transwoman on Facebook where the Tyre Nichols case happened in her locale.

She made a public comment on that and the Thin Blue Line crowd brigaded her en masse, and, because I'm on her friends list they started on me.

I'm literally on the other side of the world. I even got a ""you're not a real woman"" video post from a Trumper in Rhode Island!

Queensland. Austtalia. But they're fighting the good fight, right‚ÄΩ
I agree with all of this, especially since you mentioned an acceptable target instead of an easy target, because (unfortunately with the recent political b.s.) those girl lives in TX and although I've transitioned, I still own plenty of firearms, I'm ready for the U.S., N. Korea, Russia, or anyone else that wants to disturb my peace and way of life or any of the people I care abouts way of life, how hard is it to live and let live?
Fingers crossed ü§ûüèªü§ûüèªü§ûüèª
Was gunna coment the same thing. I really hope this is true.
Unless someone tips it over and sets the whole room on fire üò∞
Definitely a believer in the old adage ‚Äúdon‚Äôt judge someone unless you‚Äôve walked a mile in their shoes‚Äù
Thank you! I‚Äôm usually pretty good with the block button if someone is coming after me personally, but I have a really bad habit of getting sucked into the comments on inflammatory posts. Definitely something I need to work on.

And yes, the Bird App is a generally terrible place, but can be fun if you set your account to private and stay firmly in your little bubble. Tbh all social media is a scourge on society, but here we are lol
I know exactly what you mean. Sometimes I‚Äôm worried my gender marker is basically a pink triangle (I have an X on my license). And then you have the whole thing where politicians are literally trying to gather lists of trans student? Not looking great rn.
I feel the same today :(
Tbh they killed off some of their voters due to the antimask stuff from the past few years, so well see where that takes us.

I really hope them taking power isnt the case, but it unfortunately probably will somehow end up that way.

Im out of the closet, and starting hrt soon, but Im in Florida so my hrt may actually be taken away from me by 2024 anyways given what some other states are doing/trying to do.
It's a smart move I think. I live in a ground-floor apartment and I often think about if somebody followed me home and broke in while I was home alone.
Yeah, things aren‚Äôt great over here. We were making good progress for a while, but we‚Äôve been under heavy attack recently and things are regressing quickly. Although tbh I don‚Äôt know if anywhere else is that much better, no where is really great for trans acceptance. I‚Äôve heard Spain is surprisingly okay for LGBT
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, but I definitely identify with you here. I‚Äôm MUCH more self-conscious about how I present in public now out of concerns for my safety
Theyve been killing themselves off slowly since covid started back up again in the end of 2019 too. Saw so many of those specific people getting interviewed on their hospital bed about to basically croak at any second and they said they still wouldnt have masked up and taken the vaccine. Unfortunate for them, but good for us in terms of hopefully some blue, and non transphobic politicians getting elected.
I‚Äôll admit my worldview is very Western lol. I live in the US, but have also definitely noticed an uptick in the UK from what I‚Äôve seen
yeah i more meant that they think we're a group that won't be defended by the majority, like most people will go ""oh, well, i don't want people's rights taken away, but do trans people really matter that much?"" And i do think a lot of people fall prey to that line of thinking, especially since they're egged on by sensationalism and lies about our community. 

Unfortunately for them, once you decide that a demographic is ""acceptable losses"" you cant uncork that bottle. What cis people need to realize is that the fascists will not stop at us.
Applicable to anything except murder.
And, once you're a mile away, you can judge them because you have their shoes.
Yea, tbh I hesitated about updating my birth certificate because if those terrifying ""lists"".

In TX they got 16,000 names from the DMV based on who had submitted requests to have the gender on their license changed. They stopped there for now but only because their shitty data management meant it was a time consuming manual search, but there are ways around that if they reqlly want to.

My birth state isn't TX but the state government has expressed interest in a ""trans registry"" too. Starting with kids but undoubtedly to expand beyond them if given the chance.

I'm not sure if submitting that update request makes me more or less at risk now. But I figure I'm never going back there, and having mixed ID is more likely to out me in day to day life.
I ask that because here in France transphobia exist yes but doesnt seems to grow its either stagnant or declining I'm sure which is correct though but where I live I have never exeperienced transphobia.
If you aren‚Äôt already, you really need to be a professional writer! Journalist or otherwise‚Ä¶ 
It is clear you can write in a thought-provoking manner! That is both clear and calmly rational.

And yes I agree with everything you said‚Ä¶
>they think we're a group that won't be defended by the majority, 

Many of these people are the same idiots who think being a racist bigot will spark a race war and all white people will be on their side.  Got news for them.
Right. The idea is salami tactics. We are the first to attack, but look how much legislation swings for us and hits drag queens, or adversely affects cis women who don't perform femininity right. After they hang the gender traitors and burn the sexology institute library, they're coming for aborti- oh sh\*t, I mean they'll ban protes- um, I mean...

This isn't a conspiracy theory, it's literally the stated policy of organizations like Focus on the Family. (Fun fact: 'famulus,' the root of 'family,' means 'a man's possessions,' including his estate, animals, slaves, wife and children.)

shucks thanks! I've been trying to post a little... uh... better lately haha. For my own mental health i guess.
100% on the money. Their dear leader JUST released an unhinged rant about how they're going to legislate us completely out of society. People really need to wake the fuck up because the relative comfort they have been living in is a lot more tenuous than they think.

I think I am transphobic	"If I posted this in the wrong place, tell me. If I made anyone uncomfortable and they want me to remove this I will. Trigger warning for transphobic feelings.

Hey....So I have been thinking about this ever since I lost a friend. I think I may be transphobic. I have tried to inform myself ever since I learned about LGBTQ+. I think people should live as how they feel proper and trans people are valid. However, whenever I learn someone transitioned, I feel immediate dislike and disgust. I feel super ashamed afterword, but still I feel these feelings. I even subconsciously avoid people that I learned had transitioned. I always reason with myself and get over my disgust, but those initial moments... how do I stop being transphobic? All of my friends are part of the LGBTQ and I love my friends. I don't want me and my reactions to ruin any more of the relationships I treasure.

This issue has me torn. The way I think and the way I feel is so completely different. This has been a major source of self disgust and every time I google things about this, I just find people saying ""research more"" and I don't know if that will fix this. I have researched for years (about 6 years) and I still feel these feelings. I had even thought myself to posibly be lgbtq and felt these same feeling to myself. I decided I am cis and straight.

&#x200B;

tldr: I have feelings of disgust every time I learn someone transitioned. I don't like this. What to do?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit:(This turns into an angry ramble. You have been forewarned) 

it has been about a week now, and I would like to say thank you to everyone who posted. I read all the replies. I have some wonderful sources now. I would also like to say that I am a female. I understand most people thinking I may be male due to the bearded man pfp. I just hit the randomize button and thought he looked cozy. A lot of people have asked me what my fear may be. My fear is that I may be trans. I alluded to it vaguely in my last sentence, I just wasn't comfortable sharing it at that time. I now realize that has caused misunderstandings, and I take full responsibility. I have some dysphoria when it comes to my breasts. I have always despised them and refuse to look in mirrors when there is a chance I could see them. This among other things has caused me to wonder if I was trans. I refuse to entertain this thought however as I know my family would no longer like me. My dad voted for former president Donald Trump, my mom thinks all trans people are scary things and enbys don't exist/are mentally unwell (despite her saying that she isn't phobic). My mom holds my bank account and my dad owns my car. My aunt transitioned and my all of family really dislikes her. I was told to never speak of her or else others would think I was trans. Trans has always been a sort of unspoken evil in my family. I love my cousins and mother too much to attempt to ever do something gender nonconforming around them. I am 19 and have been an adult for 2 years and still live with my family. I learned the term ""trans"" when I was about 13 and ever since then I have been researching it quite a bit. My greatest desire for when I move out is to cut off all of my hair and get a buzz cut. And never wear a dress again. I posted this now because I didn't really want this to see the light of day but I am mad and needed to vent. 

My aunt is actually not the greatest person, but relations got worse when she transitioned. She is M2F. She has backstabbed all of my family members in some way or another for financial gain, she got my dad drunk and had him sign a contract that negatively effected him. That is only one example. My aunt has been the shining example of a real life trans person for the majority of my family, only reinforcing beliefs that trans is bad. My family kind of taught me this with her as an example. They would dead name her as ""petty revenge"". At the time I thought dead naming was ok as a result, until I looked into it further. 

I guess the point of this edit is to say that I am far to scared of the consequences that could arise if I were to explore my sexuality and gender properly and that reading all of the peoples answers has made me ashamed of my fear of that exploration. I had originally made this post thinking that these 2 feelings were separate but now I realize them to be connected. My fear of the possibility of being trans seeping out and affecting others around me. Thank you Reddit."	"The first thought is your parents/teachers thoughts, the second is your own.   


As long as you keep those second thoughts to be good, you will eventually find them to become your first thoughts.   
Fuck i still need to remind myself of this. When i play games and someones being annoying, my first thought is 'wow they are a \[r-slur\]' and i have to mentally step back and correct myself 'wow they are ANNOYING, nothing else'   
Or if i hear someone with a stereotypical gay voice, despite being gay myself, my first thought is 'wow, \[f-slur\]' and i have to correct myself. Why?  
*Because the first thought is whats been drilled into me. Its my fathers thoughts. Not my own.*  
Once you realize that you can better yourself, you are already doing better than those first thoughts.  


Sorry for my ramble, but ive experienced this too, and nobody talks about it. The fact is, its the life of alot of people who were raised with those thoughts ingrained in them. But as long as you try to do better, you can do better.
Wow that's very honest of you.
I think, therefore I am. You are curing yourself subconsciously by coming here. Exposure therapy to treat transphobia.
Well everyone is innately biased because our ancestors based on our fear of foreign groups for survival sake. However that instinctual prejudices become annoying in modern day. So don‚Äôt be so hard on yourself for thinking this way. Actually it is already great you immerse yourself with lgbtq despite these feelings. I am impressed by your honesty and willingness to associate with the uncomfortable. I myself was transphobic before realizing I was trans. I guess it was because I was not yet exposed enough. I am curious, after 6 years of exposure, you must have an idea of what exactly bothers you about trans people. What would that be exactly? Why is it that transitioning is disgusting?
If you genuinely want to change the way you think and feel about something, the way to do it is therapy.
How you deal with this is unique to you, but have you spent time considering what life is for us trans and enby people? Im not talking intellectually, im talking about putting yourself in our shoes?

Consider that for many of us, generally speaking, not transitioning is one of only 2 options and the one of those is the last option ever. 

Spend time thinking about what you would do in that situation. No one can grow for you. You cant become ok with trans people by only knowing the intellectual parts of the equation, you need to understand the emotional side of it.
It's good that you're working on self growth.  

I think the biggest thing to learn is that most cis people do inately fear themselves being the opposite sex. And that fear sometimes comes off as fear of trans people because our presence makes you think about something that as applied to you would make you uncomfortable.

The lesson here is, ùòµùò©ùò¢ùòµ'ùò¥ ùò®ùò¶ùòØùò•ùò¶ùò≥ ùò•ùò∫ùò¥ùò±ùò©ùò∞ùò≥ùò™ùò¢.  You imagine yourself in a body that doesn't reflect your identity for a second and it feels wrong.  That's how we feel pre transition every moment of every day, until we transition and start to feel right.

The more you allow yourself to be around trans folks, you'll learn to separate us from your own dysphoria about imagining yourself as the opposite sex, and realize, yeah you can even relate to how important it is for us to transition.
Maybe you're confusing intrusive thoughts with your actual thoughts? One thing I'd recommend is start consuming queer content, like tv shows, like Pose, Heartstopper, Sandman, Young Royals, Shameless (on HBO, but the other ones you can watch on Netflix). Or watching trans youtubers, like Noah Fince, Imo Blair White is not a very good trans rep, but she does some good takes *sometimes*, or a tik toker called Dylan (she's an awesome person btw)
Your initial thought is never your own. It's the one you've been taught is correct
if someone says they‚Äôre trans,
forget it.
completely ignore the fact they‚Äôre trans. Just act like nothing changed, because in reality, nothing changed.
they‚Äôre still the Man/Woman/Person that you know.
I was going to talk about the first thought/second thought idea but WoodyBaka beat me to it. We all have these ‚Äúfirst though‚Äù biases ingrained in us whether we realize it or not. Prejudice instilled early in childhood is difficult to shake. I would say the fact that you are repulsed by your bias is a sign that you don‚Äôt really believe in it. If you were ‚Äútruly‚Äù transphobic on a deep level you wouldn‚Äôt care. If you keep working at it I believe that your second thoughts will eventually become your first thoughts. I also think it‚Äôs valuable to explore what the root of your repulsion is, as that will affect how well you are able to recover. For my part, I had a lot of internalized transphobia growing up largely because I knew instinctively on some level that I was trans, and that everyone around me HATED trans people with a burning passion. Burying my identity and shying away from anything remotely trans-related was a way of protecting myself from abuse. I didn‚Äôt realize I was trans until I started trying to push back on the bias I was raised with. Not saying you‚Äôre trans, but if you were, this would affect how you address transphobia differently than if you‚Äôre bothered by a subversion of gender roles, or if you had the idea that ‚Äúgender/sex is eternal and immutable‚Äù hammered into you as a child. Knowledge is power, and I‚Äôve seldom started improving before I knew what was wrong in the first place. I want to commend you for being honest about having a problem, takes a lot of courage and shows a lot of character.
I, myself, am told by my wife, sometimes I am somewhat transphobic. I don‚Äôt agree, but I can‚Äôt fully deny it either. So, don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself. You‚Äôre on the right path. However, stop punishing yourself for it. The more you fight it, more it‚Äôll become an issue. Just keep appreciating the people in your life and the lines will start becoming blurry‚Ä¶
You‚Äôre trying your best and that‚Äôs what matters, plus you‚Äôre supportive.
Thank you so much for that!
You're already on the right track to deconstructing the transphobic rhetoric that's been drilled into your head. I'd say maybe go on TikTok or YouTube and watch some trans creators let yourself get past that initial corrupted thought so you can start seeing them for the people they really are. Honestly when I first started seeing trans content creators on TikTok I still had some internalized transphobia and just watching trans content helped me finish deconstructing... It also helped me come to terms with my own identity. But that's another story for another day. But yeah do that. Maybe start interacting with the trans people you've been avoiding (you can let them know you're trying to get past the negative feelings that you've been having like it may hurt them knowing that you've felt the way you have but the fact that you're putting in an effort to be better might help the situation)
This may be the first time phobia is used correctly on Reddit. There actually seems to be an irrational fear here. As your original post doesn‚Äôt mention parents a lot of people may be jumping to the conclusion of conditioning during childhood. Myself as a child of the 80‚Äôs am disgusted by the content of entertainment from that generation. But that really changed as we went into the 90‚Äôs and then had a major change entering the new millennium. Society does have an influence especially considered what was/is considered societal norms. It absolutely appears that you recognize these personal feelings as wrong and that‚Äôs a first step. Therapy is the best route when it comes to phobias. I read that you don‚Äôt have money but insurance does cover therapy even the ACA.
Wtf
So, I have a *slightly* similar issue, but it's more like I'm ashamed of myself not being able to transition, and thus I cannot partake in most things with other trans or enby people that involve transitioning or celebrating it. It's like self-hatred and inward disgust for me.

Basically I'm transphobic only to myself.
Whenever you feel like this, remember how many trans folks in here took time to read and even talk to you and try to help you when you just admitted they disgust you. Though I‚Äôm  not that kind of trans person and reading this just made me want to slap you in the face. Your brain, your own education, your choices, not our problem
So you created a brand new account just to come tell us, ""No offense, but the very thought of you makes me sick.""

What did you expect us to do for you?
Tbh, I got super uncomfortable around trans people growing up‚Ä¶until I figured out I‚Äôm trans too and then it mostly went away. Still had stuff to work on but it got better. Glad you want to get better.
I don't want to hear about how much I disgust you
as someone who was raised in a conservative home, i know how what you hear can make you feel a certain way. but when i went into middleschool, i learned to care for people. because we‚Äôre all people. we aren‚Äôt better or worse for being straight, gay, cis, or trans. i was able to change my views real fast by simply realizing they‚Äôre innocent people just like the rest of us. it‚Äôs one thing not to date trans people because of genital preferences, and that‚Äôs fine. but to be blatantly hating and rude to trans people isn‚Äôt okay. all i can advise is try your best to view them as people like you. what if you were in their situation, you know?? meeting a trans person may also help. i thought lgbt was wrong but 1) i developed my own personal thoughts and realized what others were shaming them for wasn‚Äôt right, and that they‚Äôre people like the rest of us, and 2) having a queer friend helps you build a relationship with queer people, and helps you care for and love them more. the fact you want to change is already great. but it‚Äôll be some work. don‚Äôt let others think for you. trans people are human and deserve rights like we do, it should be pretty easy to accept soon
I think you're doing pretty good. The transphobia you were raised with takes time to undo, so the longer you deal with it, the easier it becomes. It takes us some time to let go of the transphobia, too. Maybe talk to a therapist about it, as this seems to really be affecting you.
I think the fact that you are able to admit this bias and are seeking help to eliminate it is rare and huge! shows that you are already worlds ahead of most people who are truly transphobic. to me it sounds like you ultimately do accept trans people, but have been societally conditioned to find transition unacceptable. it might be helpful to read some trans literature to hear a trans person‚Äôs own perspective on their transition to have a more encompassing understanding of it. i read janet mock‚Äôs ‚Äúredefining realness‚Äù and it‚Äôs a beautiful book that I think is great insight for those who want to be supportive but are fighting that taught bias.
*headpats*
Props to OP for honesty and desire to grow past this
I think you might be disgusted because you‚Äôre not used to it, and it frightens you. You should try to make yourself used to the presence of trans people. First you should try and browse some content made by trans creators (on youtube my favourites are abigail thorn, contrapoints, sam collins, noah finnce, jamie dodger)
And eventually talk to your trans acquaintance more, and try to reflect on why such emotions come up. 
When you say you ""decided"" you were cis and straight, what do you mean? Have you ever had some conflicted thoughts about your identity?
You are doing the right thing right now: say it. 

Call yourself out. When you think those things, tell yourself ‚Äúok that was transphobic‚Äù and even say it aloud. You can‚Äôt fix what you deny is broken by saying ‚ÄúI might be transphobic‚Äù you have to instead tell yourself ‚ÄúI am transphobic‚Äù

Most straight cis people think transitioning is sexually motivated. Is that why you‚Äôre disgusted? I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre male? Women are less transphobic than men because 80% of their reasons for hating us are sexual in nature. Truly ask yourself why you are disgusted, and let it the fuck go.
Your error is in persisting in the belief that your transphobia is in any way ""natural.""

That you can't help the way you feel. You have ""friends"" (don't you f!!ckers always ""have queer friends,"" too?)in the LGBTQIA+ community, but even so ... your natural revulsion just doesn't clear you to land on this field.

That about it?

Piss off.
I'm not even gonna lie, as soon as I read the title I laughed. at least you're being honest with yourself ig üò≠ every transphobic person ik always try to argue with me about it and say ""they aren't transphobic it's just wrong"" like bitch what? üíÄ anyway if you really care about this and don't want to feel this way I'd suggest maybe going to therapy, or if you can sit in on lgbtq clubs, who knows maybe if you just make yourself hang out with trans people you'll start to see they're still just people and they aren't disgusting or bad. idrk how to help, I've never met a transphobe who felt bad about it üò≠ but I definitely do suggest therapy, it could be helpful.

I rlly do think exposure could help, maybe force yourself to stop avoiding trans people. my grandma was hellaa transphobic and said It was disgusting and wrong and a sin, but we've actually gotten very close over the past 10+ months and she doesn't say things like that to me anymore, she uses my preferred name and sorta tries with my pronouns, she tells doctors and teachers my preferred name and pronouns so I don't get misgendered at school or doctor's offices. she also used to be super homophobic and get upset over gay characters/couples on tv but now she only gets upset bc she doesn't like pda in general, she doesn't wanna watch people make out on tv lmao so it's not bc they're gay anymore it's only when they start making out or smth and she's the same with the straight couples. so it's definitely possible to change, I never thought she would but here we are!
Maybe it's not disgust but jealousy?
you said that you are ashamed for feeling that way-that tells me you don't mean the initial reaction. like other commenters, I feel like this reaction might have been the words of others, and subconsiously teaching you hatred. I think you should try not to avoid trans people as much, and mayb you'll get usd to us :D
I'm a trans woman and I've had to deal with exactly this. It's a big part of why I was closeted for so long, and I still don't think I'm fully over it. My advice would be to try desensitisation, where once you subconsciously start to accept something as normal the initial reaction you would usually have starts to fade.

Make a conscious effort not to avoid trans people. Try to spend more time with trans people, without making it weird. Look at images of trans people (not porn btw, trans people in everyday life. Porn might help, but could condition you to see trans people as sexual). Eventually you will subconsciously start to accept transness as normal, and that initial disgust will fade.
There‚Äôs internalized transphobia and overt transphobia. 

Overt transphobia is active. It‚Äôs people engaging in hateful rhetoric. It‚Äôs people only listening to other transphobic people and feeding hate through fear in people who are ignorant or on the fence. It‚Äôs those weaponizing our existence to gain power. 

Internalized transphobia is there because it‚Äôs how you learned to navigate the world. Society taught it. Maybe your parents taught it. It‚Äôs normalized. It‚Äôs what the overtly transphobic try to pull at in you. Many trans people have it ourselves. 

It‚Äôs the thing that had me‚Äî an enby that uses they/them‚Äî being like ‚Äúbut people with neopronouns are just being extra‚Äù before I really sat and picked it apart. 

It‚Äôs the thing that has some binary trans people saying that I just need to figure out that I‚Äôm a man already. It‚Äôs the thing that leads much of the trans community to judge ourselves or other trans people as ‚Äúnot trans enough‚Äù. 

Everyone has internalized biases. It‚Äôs what you do with them that matters. 

Are you doing any active work with the thoughts or feelings? Or are you just waiting til they go away?  If you‚Äôre able to, finding a therapist that does CBT might be helpful. 

What I‚Äôm going to offer here is not therapy advice or even recommendations‚Ä¶ but things you might consider‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre things I‚Äôve found helpful with my own biases.

I approach the thoughts and feelings with curiosity. I have found that the more I try to force myself to believe something I don‚Äôt believe‚Äî even if it‚Äôs something I really want to believe‚Äî the more my brain comes up with reasons for what I actually believe, and that just reinforces the problem

‚Ä¢what is it I really believe here?
  (be honest. If the answer is ‚ÄòI want to believe trans people are valid but I don‚Äôt quite think they‚Äôre the same as cis people‚Äô okay. If the answer is ‚ÄòI‚Äôm pretty disgusted by trans people‚Äô okay‚Ä¶ you have to meet yourself where you‚Äôre at).

‚Ä¢ how much do I believe it? (Scale of 0-10 or 100%‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt really matter)

‚Ä¢what evidence do I think I have for my belief? (i.e. *why* do I think I believe this?)

‚Ä¢for each piece of evidence‚Ä¶ what are the other possible explanations?
 (e.g. if the belief is ‚ÄúI think trans people are creepy‚Äù and one of the whys is ‚Äúevery time I see a trans person they‚Äôre acting suspicious‚Äù 
other possible explanations might be 

-that the person is uncomfortable in the setting that they‚Äôre in

-maybe they‚Äôre worried about hateful things being said

-maybe they‚Äôre anxious about something entirely unrelated to their identity

-maybe they‚Äôre stressed because they‚Äôve got a lot going on at work. 

-I would also include that maybe I see a lot more trans people than I think I do I‚Äôm just unaware that they‚Äôre trans

‚Ä¶.when I‚Äôm doing this exercise for my own faulty beliefs I find every possible explanation I can think of for every piece of ‚Äòevidence‚Äô and write it down in ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù form‚Ä¶ it takes a long time but it‚Äôs training the brain to consider alternatives)

‚Ä¢then I start using bridging statements (sometimes these get called if-formations‚Ä¶ though that‚Äôs usually for self beliefs) to help myself start building the bridge between what I currently believe and what I want to believe. 

Bridging statements live in the possibility, the what if, the maybe. They open the door to a different belief without forcing it and allow the brain to look for evidence instead of doubling down on the current belief.

So if I figured out my belief currently was ‚Äútrans people are creepy‚Äù
my first bridging statement might be: ‚Äúwhat if it‚Äôs possible trans people aren‚Äôt quite as creepy as I perceive them to be?‚Äù

and I would just sit with that. Hang out with it for a while. Remind myself of it regularly (for me that‚Äôs often setting it as the background on my phone or setting a reminder with whatever that may be) make sure to pose it any time that original thought comes up naturally. 

Eventually I find enough evidence that I can sit with the next statement‚Ä¶ which is usually turning the first statement into something more firm. So in this example something like ‚ÄúTrans people aren‚Äôt quite as creepy as I used to think they were‚Äù and I repeat the process of reminding myself that regularly. 

Then once I get that down really well, I go back to the possibility realm. In this example. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs possible some trans people are even pretty chill.‚Äù‚Ä¶ 

and I would just keep repeating that process until I got to ‚Äútrans people are normal and just as valid as any other human‚Äù‚Ä¶ or whatever I wanted the positive belief to be. 

The key, I‚Äôve found, is not moving on from any of the maybes or the more firm statements until I really feel like it‚Äôs my core belief now. Until it‚Äôs AT LEAST at the same ranking or more on ‚Äúhow much do I believe it‚Äù than the initial belief.
Yeah, my parents always said the fa word so it's been drilled into me since like 8, I don't mean it though- nd alwshame myself for it
Yup, this.
This is good advice  üëè üëèüëè
i mean, at least they‚Äôre TRYING to get better. it‚Äôs better to admit you‚Äôre wrong and get help than to stay an asshole. i really hope they can get where they need to be. the fact they show interest in changing gives me hope.
The thing is I am really bad at knowing and realizing myself, my thoughts, and who I am. I am unsure of what it is that I dislike as there is nothing to dislike. I have tried to figure it out and cannot. My family is definitely anti LGBTQ and I think there may be some childhood dislike lingering, but I am not sure. You would think that wouldn't be affecting me as an adult.
If I had that kind of money I would. I did do some therapy for a bit but the therapy wasn't going the way I wanted/felt I needed. I quit and don't have the money to go therapist shopping.
this. it seems like (and please correct me if im wrong) once you learn someone is trans, you put their transness before the fact that theyre a person. a regular person, just like you. in lots of situations our transness is a vital part of our lives. its our lived experiences, our perspectives, it shapes us to our core, but we are still human and deserving of love and empathy. it seems like you know this, OP, you just struggle with applying it. honestly, its going to take a lot of work to undo that bias, but it seems like youre willing to put in the work. what youre doing by being in the trans reddit is good, read as much about our lives as you can until this is normal to you. read into psychology, specifically about unlearning biases. i would also recommend finding fiction books by trans authors about our experiences, especially if they belong to a community you belong to so you can find a way to relate to the characters. off the top of my head id recommend looking into cemetery boys by aiden thomas. studies have shown that fiction books do affect the way we think, so finding books and media where being trans is normal and you see what life is actually like for us, the joy we experience, our ups and downs, our euphoria will likely help. try to look for happier books to reinforce the idea that being trans isnt something to be disgusted of

summary: find ways to learn to see the human in us so you can embrace the trans in us. read books by us, for us. listen to our stories and find what you can relate to. have patience with yourself, but dont expect all trans people to welcome you with open arms into our community with your current outlook on us, some of us have just had it really rough and would prefer our safe spaces to stay that way
Cis Men often say if they could be a woman, 99% of their answers are sexual in nature. Asking a cishet man to imagine being trans is exactly how they start believing we are monsters. They believe if they were in womenswear, they would be aroused, so all trans women must feel the same way.
Yeah, I would say the same. Like how would you feel if you lived in a wrong body and had to present as such and constantly bc of that got missgendered. Propably quite bad.

I atleast did and still do when it happens like half the time. And having issues with gender assesment clinic denying assesmwnt literally felt like nearing the final option until I found a semi diy way to go through transition.
really interesting way to put it, hadn‚Äôt thought of it this way before
Our flag means death is an excellent queer show, and One Topic At A Time makes really wholesome lgbtq+ on YouTube.
Ps. I‚Äôm a TransWoman. And what triggers me is my own ‚Äúnot passing‚Äù features. It‚Äôs only ever triggered by my own image and never by someone else‚Äôs
I did, and I apologies. I had hoped for someone to help point me in the right direction of research. A YouTube channel, a research paper, something I hadn't thought of as I have tried and failed for years. I do not wish to dislike trans people and most of the time I don't, but sometimes, my gut reaction goes against reason.
Not at all. You don't immediately become removed from the biases you witnessed growing up bc you are now an adult. Like everything, it takes time and effort to change your thinking. I think you are very brave and self aware to make the effort, and I wish more people were like that.
I'll also recommend a book called Gender Euphoria. It's a quite good book that shows the positives trans ppl experience transitioning and also does not sexualise transness.
I always think it‚Äôs better to put it in perspective the opposite way; if talking to a cis man ask them to imagine that they feel/ identify exactly as they really do but were assigned female at birth. i find this is easier for people to reach compassion because they‚Äôre not trying to imagine feeling like a gender they‚Äôre not, they‚Äôre trying to imagine being perceived as something they‚Äôre not.
I'll check those out, I love hearing about new queer shows! Where do you watch the first one?
If your desires are genuine, then I appreciate that. I don't know what we could show you after six years, though. And I will be honest: It's not our responsibility to ease your soul when you come with this message, any more than it would be the responsibility of a group of African-American folks if you went on one of their subs and told them they made you sick. At best, they would show you the door. 

Here it is, as I see it, knowing I don't speak for the whole community: We're just people, humans who want to live the best lives we can as our truest selves. Make some friends. Hopefully find love. Same as anyone else. 

Many of us have suffered greatly all our lives before coming to this point, and we know that a lot of the world hates and fears us. We don't want to hurt anyone -- or even *bother* anyone if we can help it. We just want to be treated as people. 

If you can start by working through that concept, you might make some progress.
watch the contrapoints video ‚Äòare traps gay‚Äô
Yes I agree. This post is evident enough that you carry self awareness. You actually listen to us. You attempt in understanding us. All there is left is collecting your thoughts/feelings. What really helped me not be transphobic was when I realized that I see for example a trans man a man trapped in a female vessel. Who grew up being forced to play as a female in our world of a stage. And then I sympathize with him. I later realized I empathized because I heavily related. It may be the empathy that is missing. Empathy doesn‚Äôt come naturally to me. I can see how it would be harder to do so from someone who is not trans. So maybe practice empathy with trans friends. Continue what you are doing with listening and being open-minded.
Yes, this is a good way of thinking about it.
I think it‚Äôs on HBO? And if you want more a have a couple others up my sleeve
I had hoped not to try to make it your responsibility to tell me and explain to me, hence the years of me doing research on my own. As a non white person, I understand the feeling of resentment one may have when others feel they are owed my experience. 

I appreciate you telling me your experiences and I hope that I will be able to make use of this knowledge. I tend to think of things in a factual way and less in the emotional way, perhaps spending more time reading personal experiences and attempting to relate to them would help. Thank you.
ohhh, thx, yes plese I need new shows to watch and I can't take any more cis/het shows that have 1 gay person and cast it as a LGBTQIA+ show lmaoo
Gentlemen Jack- haven‚Äôt gotten around to watching it yet, but it seems really great. Is about a very butch lesbian in the 1700‚Äôs I think. Fairly sure it‚Äôs based on a real story too.

Good Omens- Based on a book by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Cishet ppl probably wouldn‚Äôt realise it‚Äôs queer, and nothing is actually shown, but it is still very much queer. The two main characters are enby and very much In Love. Neil Gaiman has stated that a) they‚Äôre in love b) s2 is going too be ‚Äúsoft and romantic‚Äú. (and every single character they meet in the book immediatly thinks the‚Äôre gay)

What we do in the shadows- A mockumentary about vampire. Very casually queer, but it isn‚Äôt focused on that. Still good tho.

Heaven Official‚Äôs blessing- kinda more anime than show, but still just fantastic. Based on the novels with the same name, and there is also a comic version with absolutely stunning art that you can read (for free) online.

I see you already know Heartstopper.

Hope you find something you like (:

Am i still trans if I like flowers and other typically ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù things?	"Hello y‚Äôall! I‚Äôve been a lurker on this sub for a lil while and you are all amazing I‚Äôm so proud of each and everyone one of u for having the courage to be true to yourselfüíû(damn scottie stop with the cliche lmao..)

Anywho I have a question that‚Äôs been on my mind I hope it‚Äôs ok I ask it here (normal ‚Äúask‚Äù subs are usually very -phobic about these things sadly)

I identify as a trans dude rn (or non-binary depending on the day) but I still rlly like flowers n cats and the colour pink and I never cared for makeup in general but I enjoy wearing/seeing skirts n dresses and virtually any other traditionally ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù thing u can think of! I‚Äôve generally been happy with myself but from time to time I get the horrible thought everyone here is probably familiar with - am I really trans? Am I trans ENOUGH?

‚ÄòCause I see a lotta trans dudes and they go on T and they get buff and facial hair and pass really well and they are so valid!! But I cant see myself being like that. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I want to go on T (and I hate my voice lol so that‚Äôs gotta change) but I don‚Äôt see myself ever fitting in to that box most people sort trans dudes into.

So, idk, is this a common occurrence for anyone else here? Do y‚Äôall think I can still identify as trans even tho I don‚Äôt fit in that box? I am constantly paranoid I‚Äôm ‚Äústealing a label‚Äù haha.

Thank you üíñ"	"Flowers don't determine what your gender is, neither do skirts, makeup, colours or hair length, what determines your gender is what you know, if you know you are a man then you are a man.
Am I still a trans girl despite liking swords and castles and map games like ck3/eui4/hoi4? The answer is yes. Interests might *possibly* be linked to gender, but the link is quite minimal, and tons of people like stuff ""from the other gender"".

Feel free to keep your interests, you're still incredibly valid and no one else can tell you what to enjoy as a dude.
Just do what feels good. That‚Äôs the whole point
Nothing you could do or like will invalidate your gender. I still play videogames, and play wargames no one mistakes the ladies of sword and steel for guys. You will be a handsome guy or NB surrounded by flowers and cats. It all fine
Nobody has pointed out that cats, of all things, are not gendered... except that nobody will call you the crazy cat lady anymore!
In my opinion, what you like and your gender have nothing to do with one another. I have guy friends who absolutely love feminine things but are the most manly guys you'll ever meet. What you like is your personality, your gender is how you feel physically. If you feel like physically you should be a guy, then you're a guy, but if you feel that physically you should be a girl, then you're a girl.

In short, you're still trans for liking feminine things because what you like isn't tied to your gender
Yes
A few weeks ago, I saw what I believe to be a CIS male and his wife walking down the street, his huge white beard and long white hair. He looked like Odin or something. A beautiful, masculine looking beast man.


And he was wearing a skirt. Definitely a skirt and not a kilt. And he was absolutely f*cking rocking it.


If that guy can wear a skirt, you can. I bet he liked flowers too.
Have you engaged with a professional therapist/councillor yet (preferably a gender specialist, but I understand those are rare)? Everyone here is going to want to help you put the doubt out of your mind, but there is only so much us random internet peeps can know/do. 

That said, the ""box most sort trans dudes into"" is a much an unhelpful construct as the ""stuff for boy"" and ""stuff for girls"" boxes, so really don't feel you need to force yourself to conform to that perceived ""norm"".
In the end what determines if you're trans enough is not what your body will look like or what you are interested in. 

What really counts is how you feel. If you feel like you're a man who likes to look at dresses, flowers and cat videos then you're exactly that and you're probably not alone either.

On another note: if you want you can go get yourself a kilt. Still a skirt and nobody is going to suspect a thing.
Check out /r/FtMFemininity, bro. Might be for you. üòÅ
You be you no right or wrong. I don't usually date guys but if I did I want the super cliche gay guy that likes being pink queer and I can get flowers for and make him blush.
How you express your gender and what your gender is are two different things. Have fun with it and do whatever you want. We all question whether or not we‚Äôre valid. Being trans comes with insecurities. You are 10000% valid <3. I find people who break gender norms very attractive and inspiring. Double down on that shit. It‚Äôs awesome
Everyone can like feminine things. Nothing changes if you do.
Listen, personality and gender, sure something may come into contact with how media portrays it, but dont let your personality affect your gender in anyway it shouldn't, nor vice versa, be who you want to be, if you enjoy flowers, you can still be a guy
That really helps thank you <3 I guess it‚Äôs a bit hard when I‚Äôm constantly surrounded by ‚Äúmakeup and skirts are for girls, football and sweat is for boys!‚Äù or something ridiculous lmao, trying to break out of that mindset and learning to ignore what The CisTM say
Oooh hell yeah swords are cool! I want a sword lmao. 

I think interests are linked to gender only if one has been brought up that way. I was brought up pretty neutral but the country I lived in was very male-dominated and binary, all the boys were messing around in dirt and it was normal but when I did it it was weird and I got made fun of. 

Thank you so much for your supportive comment kind stranger ‚ù§Ô∏è
Sometimes I can tell myself in confidence that my interests won‚Äôt invalidate me but at times I just need a lil bit of reassurance, Yknow? Haha I certainly hope I become surrounded by flowers and cats in the future! (Would be hell on my allergies tho) ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ahahahaha yeah that‚Äôs true, I suppose there‚Äôs just that binary tie with even ANIMALS that ‚Äúdogs are masculine and cats are feminine‚Äù which is bs but Yknow, the CisTM are strange ü§∑

Advice re: my 12-year-old who's contemplating gender	"First, let me say that I am an ally and completely supportive of the full spectrum of gender and sexuality, so I don't want this to seem like me being phobic about things with my child.  To the contrary I want to be as supportive as I can be.

That said, my son who is twelve casually let my wife and I know yesterday that he's been thinking a lot about what it'd be like if he were a girl.  The trouble is that even though he is 12 and should be able to start assessing and understanding these things about himself, he is also a 'young' 12 with ADHD and in being supportive attempted to ask him what about the idea appealed to him and the only thing that came up was that he thinks girls are more flexible (physically - something I was very careful not to smile over because I don't think he quite gets that such a change wouldn't in fact change his own flexibility).

He's since more openly started thinking about feminine names which his 15-year-old sister has been very helpful with, but I want to know if there are ways that I can better help him understand if this is really his path.  I know probably better than he may realize at the moment how hard of a path this may prove to be with friends, family, etc., and I worry that he'll start down it half-committed and change his mind in 6 months, but if ht does it publicly that social 'damage' is kind of done.

Again, my goal here is that I want to be helpful and supportive with my child on whatever path is taken, but pointers on helping him realize whether this path is the right one from people who've been down these roads would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!

Edit: as a follow-up:

1. Thank you all for the great advice. It's all been helpful and clarifying.

2. It seems that (at least for now) this might have been jumping the gun. In a follow-up conversation today with my wife, he clarified that it doesn't really feel like hed rather be a girl, just that he was intrigued by the idea. But he also stated he doesn't really feel like the other boys either. Given that we've never enforced or encouraged any particular gender roles ahd he's a naturally sensitive soul, I can see how he might feel alienated. To be clear though, if he does change his tune to claim that this is a path he wants to pursuit, all of your advice will be top of mind. "	"The best you can do is take your child to a therapist specializing in gender. They'll be able to help your kid figure this out. 

Also, if your child wants to be public about it that's their decision to make, and even though they might pay the social price, that's the fault of the other kids and not your child. I get your concern, and if they do decide to do that I'd keep in touch with school administration in case issues come up. But I'd urge you not to talk your child out of coming out, because that teaches them it's their fault rather than the other kids'.
**Find your child a good gender therapist.**  They are trained to work with people and help them figure this stuff out.  And just because he can‚Äôt express what he‚Äôs feeling now fully, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the flexibility is the only thing driving this.  He‚Äôs at a crucial age where things like puberty blockers may have a huge positive impact on his future life if he‚Äôs really trans.

I‚Äôm looking forward to the day when there is no ‚Äúsocial damage‚Äù from this kind of questioning, but I recognize we‚Äôre not there yet.  But it makes me sad.

And now you‚Äôve got me curious about whether flexibility changes with proper hormones for trans girls who transition early enough. üòÑ It‚Äôs certainly young enough for bone structure to change.

Anyway, I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs got a supportive family, wherever he ends up.  Good luck, from a fellow ADHD parent.
Psychology today has an online directory of trans aware therapists... Find a WPATH complaint one and interview them. 
@ OP

Remain open for any further ""trans"" developments, but it is also quite possible that he is exploring in a purely theoretical way.  Check also for signs of bullying and other discipline problems at school, in the school bus or in other activities he does.

Your description of him reminds me of how I felt when I was 12 or 13 (and I am almost 60, so we didn't know anything about LGBT issues back then). My sister and I were raised in a fairly gender-neutral way and I fit only a few of the male stereotypes. But I don't care.

Back in my early teens, I often wondered how it would feel to develop feminine attributes instead of eventually developing masculine ones. It never was ""I should be a woman"", but rather ""What if; would that be different?"" And if you had asked me at any time if I dreamed of eventually being an old man or an old woman, my typical answer would always have been ""I don't mind either"".

But one aspect made me envious of the girls at school: the administration cared about their safety. I was bullied a lot because I didn't quite fit in ‚Äì I hate organized sports and I am not competitive  preferring collaboration (like a relay race). And even though my father interviewed quite often at school, they considered that bullying was good for the boys, that boys need to be rough against eachother, but that girls don't need that. So there were times in my teens when I dreamed to be a girl for a few years so I could be at peace.

So I'm not saying it is your son's problem, but check to make sure there isn't some other lingering issue.


So everyone else pretty much covered everything else that needed to be said.

However you are incorrect about hormones changing flexibility. Most things in the body are affected by our primary hormone in our bodies, including even your bone structure if you start hrt early enough in life. I got way way more flexible after being on hrt for a while, as well as my hips rotated and feet developed a higher arch as most things including ligaments will be affected by HRT.
I think you should get him in to see a therapist/psychologist who specialises in gender identity. Ideally you don't want to push him one way or the other, but this is a very crucial time in his life since he will very soon start going through puberty (if he hasn't already).

If it starts looking my to look like there's a reasonable chance he could be transgender, you should definitely look into getting him on hormone blockers, which will pause his natural male puberty until he is old enough to understand himself enough to decide what to do.

Time is of the essence with this since puberty is going to hit very soon. If it turns out he is trans and goes through the wrong puberty, it will be very distressing and psychologically damaging for him. You need to get on top of this very quickly.
Ask him if he has dysphoria. If he says yes, he's a she. If he says no, he's not.
Thanks!  And I understand what you're saying about the fault issues (and is why I came here for these questions).  I certainly don't mean to suggest I want to dissuade him, just that I didn't know how to really help him know that he is sure about this.  My wife and I have been pretty careful and vigilant about gender-neutral parenting with our kids and as a result neither of them really fit their culturally-normative expectations.  My daughter tends to be more acutely aware of her atypical gender-social alignment then my son.  

In the same conversation my daughter (15yo) casually dropped that she thinks she's pansexual, which is honestly more sexually interested than I'd figured her for as I was beginning to suspect she might turn out to be asexual (again, no judgment on her either way - I just want them to be happy and healthy).
I‚Äôll second this but make sure they‚Äôre a good therapist that isn‚Äôt low key trying to convert or dissuade him. If he thinks about it over a few sessions and comes to realise that he‚Äôs not trans, that‚Äôs fine. If he releases he‚Äôs trans then that‚Äôs also fine. 

At the end of the day, it‚Äôs more important he has a place to explore his gender with supportive parents because that could be all the difference in his realisation that he‚Äôs cis or trans. From what you‚Äôve said, you‚Äôre already great parents!
Thank you!  I will look into that.

As for the social damage, I agree - I'd love for him to be able to explore this without shame or derision.  But kids can be cruel and adults are sometimes no better.

On the point of flexibility, he's about as skinny as a kid can get already and has more energy than I ever did, so his ability to bend is mostly limited to his determination to push things.  He's attempted karate, gymnastics and parkour lessons, but never sticks to it long enough to cement the skills (probably partially because of his ADHD).
Dont be curious, flexibility absolutely gets way better if you start early enough. I got way more flexible after around a yearish of hormones.
Thank you for this. I can say with certainty that some of this hits the nail on the head for my son. He's always been a very sensitive soul who wears his heart on his sleeve. And now in sixth grade, he's basically been in school with the same group of classmates since kindergarten and has always had trouble fitting in with the other boys of his class. He is energetic and active, but not competitive or aggressive. He'd sooner spend recess playing make believe and directing people through the fantasy stories than playing a sport (I was the same way).

In the aftermath of having brought up this gender identity question, one of the observations that he brought up was the social dichotomy of how it was generally acceptable for a girl to join a group of boys in a given activity, but the reverse was typically a harder sell - which I found to be an astute observation at his age of something that is true for a number of complex and layered reasons.

Bottom line, while it doesn't seem like he's in a place at this time where a gender change is likely in the near term, he's definitely acutely aware that he doesn't quite line up with his peers (via a mix of our gender-neutral parenting ahd his natural disposition). So either way he might face some tough times socially over the next few years and my wife and I will need to be ready for that and supportive of him through the struggles. In the end I want to see him find confidence being who he is - whether that is as a he or she is secondary. 
Hey, sorry to bother you but shouldn't someone wait until they are 18 to start medically transitioning? I don't know how true it is but I've read that sometimes people change their minds and regret using blockers at such a young age because it's irreversible. Have a good day.
That seems simple enough, but that assumes he'd even know what that term means. I'm fairly certain he thinks there might just be a pill he can take where he wakes up with long hair and girl parts. He's a great kid with a big imagination, but not one who has a deep appreciation for the complexities of the world. 
I know this is a super late follow-up but relating to that bit about your daughter, I lost my virginity to a girl when I was 14, then acted on some feelings toward a boy I'd had since I was about twelve, and neither time felt physically right so I was confused for nearly a decade about what I was actually attracted to, and spent almost all that time in long distance/+poly relationships, with minimal sexual activity on my end. When I started my transition to female and lost my sex drive and was able to really look at my feelings objectively and not through the testosterone lens, I realized that I was not bi/pansexual, but rather pan*romantic* asexual, with no physical attraction, just emotional attraction and attachment. But again, it took twelve years for me to arrive at that conclusion, and there's no way to throw labels at someone, they have to decide what fits themselves. Just anecdotal but that resonated with memories of younger me.
That‚Äôs awesome!  Far too late for me, I‚Äôm afraid, though I have noticed a couple of yoga poses being a bit easier.  Maybe looser ligaments or something.
Blockers won‚Äôt do that and it‚Äôs very rare for someone who actually is trans to detransition outside of heavy and abusive influence for them being who they are. Blockers are reversible, and really won‚Äôt cause damage if you‚Äôre only on them for a couple of years. Which is more than enough time for more regular visits before being prescribed hormones. There are a lot of hoops to jump through for this people ignore
Blockers just hit pause on puberty. If you stop taking them, your natural puberty will start back up again. I haven't heard of any side effects but if there were any, I'd bet they are very minor in comparison to the risk of permanent dysphoria that _not_ being put on hormone blockers could bring. I'm not a doctor though, and I'm sure OP and their child would talk it through with their doctor if they decide to go this route.

It's quite rare for trans people to change their minds, but going through their natural puberty is almost certain to be very distressing. It's about picking the option that is least likely to cause damage.
>I'm fairly certain he thinks there might just be a pill he can take where he wakes up with long hair and girl parts.

Well, at least at 12, time and HRT can provide long hair and girl parts (except genitals). Granted, that doesn't solve the social bit, but kids who start that early should pass easily, making the social bit a lot easier later on.
That's fair and helpful to hear.  I honestly was not too worried about what labels my daughter opts for or whether she changes her tune a few times on the road to that discovery.  My curiosity there is simply how can I help her be comfortable with who she is regardless of who she likes or doesn't like.  

And to an extent I'm glad that she hasn't gone down the rabbit hole of crushes and romantic preoccupation, not because I at all begrudge her that or aren't ready for it, but rather, knowing my own path and that of many other people I know, I hope for her to be clear of such confusion to occlude who she discovers she is as a person.  While I don't care if my kids end up gay, bi, pan, or straight, or end up trans, cis, or non-binary, what I *do* want for my kids is to be independently confident in who they are and what they want from life and not to try and define themselves too soon by the relationships they keep.

I can only imagine how confusing a path you may have had - especially as understanding and tolerance around these areas is still a work in progress, but it's encouraging to hear that you found a trail through it to a state in which you are comfortable with who you are.  So truly, thank you for sharing.
Haha thats pretty much all it did for me. Getting deep into a stretch just became easier, like my body was fighting it less. Yoga will take care of the rest though, its definitely not to late."	9tmmuz	trans	27	1.0	2018-11-02 18:18:54

Trans girl who works at a local theater is my inspiration	"Hopefully she is a Redditor so that I can actually talk to her and apologize, but, anyway....

My friend and I were going to see GotG2 way back when. He isn‚Äôt so much of a friend, but rather a childhood acquaintance. We have grown up together, but he doesn‚Äôt really know anything about me. He is VERY racist and phobic all around, and it constantly gets on my nerves.

Anyway, I‚Äôm going with him and my father to see GotG Volume 2. We walk into the lobby, and the person checking tickets looks to be a trans woman (and I hate pointing this out‚Äîthey‚Äôre just women, I get it, but in this instance it is important for the impact). She looks to be having a rough day. The place is a little hot and she has a fan cooling her down. 

Anyway, my father is obviously nervous as he is aware that I am (or were) trans. My parents had sent me to rehab the summer before for coming out as trans, so I‚Äôm not sure if they think they extinguished that or not.

He hands her the tickets, and she points us in the right direction.

Then my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù says the unthinkable. Under his breath, he does the whole ‚Äúgaaaiiiyyyyy‚Äù thing. I wanted to clock him right there, because I am almost 90% sure she heard him.

But I didn‚Äôt do anything. It would blow my cover. If I did, I would be jeopardizing everything I tried to repair at rehab.

So we just went on our merry way.

With that said, she gave me so much courage to continue living in hope of a bright future. The amount of courage she must have to have to deal with people like my ‚Äúfriend‚Äù is insane.

So, whoever you are. I am sorry. I wish I did something in that moment, but I couldn‚Äôt push myself to act up. Hopefully you Reddit and will see this. If not, it‚Äôs at least helping me to get this off my conscience.

I was all for it until I realized I was in a cabin in the middle of Arkansas with drug dealers, pedophiles, and alcoholics.

We were told that anything of the sort was a sexual deviation, and we were not able to leave until we ‚Äúadmitted‚Äù we weren‚Äôt really LGBT.
I feel like this every day. But then I remember that it won‚Äôt change anything.

Decided to tell my grandmother about Biden's actions to free up trans healthcare.	"This is just a vent post

So, before this i should mention my grandmother is an extremely adamant Trump supporter, and i thought she was only mildly trans-phobic, mostly just not understanding.

Anyway, she was fixing dinner and i told her about the news. Her reaction involved calling Biden things like stupid, degenerate, and whatever else she said in the conversation afterward. When i asked her how it was apparently bad that people were getting access to something they should have the basic right to, she responded with ""When you are old enough you will understand why someone else limiting what you can and can't do with your body is a good thing""

She only said that because she didn't have an explanation, instead blaming it on me being to young, but i guess just add that to the pile of reasons i won't be telling her anything."	"[deleted]
I'm sorry you have to deal with that.
Well let me tell you this he's only doing that because he knows that he might not win in 2024 so he's trying to make himself look good I mean it's exactly what Trump did with his voter pool he made himself look like the candidate that'd sort everything out when in reality he was a billionaire out of his depth and didn't really know what he was doing even his transgender military ban makes no sense so either he lied about them being a financial burden or he was just mistaken Biden however he's been in office for what 4 5 months and has already announced the spending of 4 trillion dollars which is what previous presidents spent in a year it's absolutely insane Trump is an unstable narcissistic megalomaniac and Biden is a virtue signalling clueless clown all politicians are the same if he truly cared about trans folks he A wouldn't have chosen Kamala Throw That Trans Woman In A Male Prison Harris and he would've done more far far sooner so please don't mistake his virtue signalling as him caring about trans folks he doesn't he's just trying to make himself look good despite being a hypocrite he criticised Trump for being a racist yet he's possibly just as racist as Trump let's not forget what he did back in the 90's I believe or what he said about Obama
Well shes actually my great grandmother, and isnt a boomer, i just have a much closer relationship with her than my actual grandma so i just call her that.
This post was just talking about my grandmother, j never praised him i dont think. I really didnt need an essay on your belief about Biden.

It's not my belief about him it's more my complete inability to grasp why anyone thinks any politician actually cares about anyone but themselves even going all the way back to Washington and the war of independence that was primarily about how the British were taxing tea too much and the rich didn't like that because it cut into their profits none of them were anti British they were just anti tax so they were like me libertarian bordering on anarchist
Thankfully my parents i believe would be understanding at the least, maybe not quite understand but still supportive.
Yeah, and i never said anything about Biden other than what he's just done, like saying that flys can walk too, just a fact and nothing more.

I personally don't like Joe Biden very much, haven't been super favorable of most politicians recently, but if you wanted to scream about everyone's inability to see his virtue signaling maybe say that on a post praising him while being unaware of his virtue signaling. All i talked about was my transphobic grandmother and her reaction to his statement.
Why's it not obvious that Biden is Trump's puppet Trump is still in charge he's controlling Biden via a chip the CIA implanted in his brain

My partner used to get upset about the idea of going out in public with me when I was wearing a skirt. I think they felt as if it somehow reflected badly on them to be associated with a ""guy"" dressed as a woman. I think they anticipated that they would be called upon to explain.

For *me* that particular phase ended the day that I wore a skirt out to the store with them... and they didn't notice until I pointed it out. I wasn't ""hiding"" it, I didn't ""sneak"" it... it just got to the point where they stopped noticing. After that, I guess they figured that if they could be right next to me and it didn't stand out to them, that maybe people mostly didn't really notice or care, that it wasn't going to be a social scandal that they would have to continually apologize for.

Can someone explain voice training to me?	"I‚Äôm afab and genderfluid and I‚Äôve wanted a deeper voice for forever but I literally know nothing about it‚Ä¶if I don‚Äôt take testosterone(phobic parents) will it work? Is it permanent if I train long enough or is it more of a temporary thing? And how the hell do I even do it?!?

But literally omfg I wanna sound like one of those grunge singers from the nineties like the used or bullet for my valentine holy shit please

Edit: would this affect my singing voice in any way?"	"I believe it isn't a permanent thing, as you do constantly have to change your pitch from what it wants to be. But over time, that active pitch-changing becomes natural to you so you eventually don't have to think about doing it if you keep it up üòä
Look up Mongolian throat singing. (Also called Tuvan (sp?) throat singing) It uses the false vocal folds at the back of the throat in order to make subharmonic sounds. Bass singers can use it to drop to truly epic levels of ‚Äúdeep‚Äù but your average alto can also use to to hit a gravelly tenor or even baritone if your lucky. Give it a whirl! It‚Äôs why my range goes from about e4 to f1. 

Once you get good enough you can flip back and forth pretty easily. I can go from my femmy work voice just below middle c to sounding like an goddamn 8 foot tall ogre for D&D games. Hehe
Look into the different vocal chambers. it‚Äôs for singing techniques high and low pitch. Basically you hold your breath as you talk in your chest and low throat. Try to literally feel your voice sitting in your chest as you talk. As our voices develop when we get older our bodies get used to talking in a certain pitch (usually masking voices of others around us) and we unwittingly use a combination of these vocal chambers to form our natural speaking voice. The more you practice talking in your chest and in a lower vocal range, the easier and more natural your speaking voice will sound as you train these muscles.

I have the strongest urge to ruffle your hair right now.

As far as voice training goes, I'm just getting started and trying to go the other way to you, but so far it seems like it's mostly about learning how to use your voice in different ways and getting comfortable with that until it feels natural. It feels more like developing a skill than anything else to me, and many of the basic exercises I've been starting with are actual vocal exercises people use for singing. There's a good subreddit with lots of useful links and guides, I'll edit the link in to my comment here: r/transvoice. I'm starting with their [sticky post on introductory resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/transvoice/comments/mgaci7/solid_introductory_voice_training_resources/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). It's intimidatingly long, but you can probably just jump straight in with Zhea and Clover's 2 hour YouTube video linked near the top if you like, I've just been working my way through that every now and then when I've got a spare half hour or so.
Retraining speaking patterns can also do a lot
Okay good to know thanks!!
Bro tysm I totally will

Also hell yes to that range holy shit
Ahh okay thanks!
Hey thanks sis!! That‚Äôs pretty good advice!!

Also yes giv da ruffles I have the best hair for that
My issue is that ON A GOOD DAY I can hit a low alto. Somehow, despite this, I still fly stealth at work. Nobody knows I‚Äôm not afab.
No worries, happy to help \^\^

Haha ok then \^\^ \*ruffles hair\* You're a funny kid, you know that? :P And oh my goodness it *is* perfect for rufflage! That's little sibling hair if ever I felt it! \^\^

Edit: Oh wait I just thought I'd better double check and realised in your op you said you're genderfluid not transmasc (I got mixed up because you're aiming for a more masculine voice), I hope it was ok to call you that! I've just edited to be more gender neutral (silly English and it's gendered sibling nicknames!)
 Skdmsksmsks sorry I‚Äôve wanted a big sibling my whole life 

And it‚Äôs okay!! Perfectly fine!! lol I actually prefer masculine names!! Dw big sis it‚Äôs kk
Haha thanks for being chill bro \^\^ I figured you probably would but I'm trying not to assume!

Closeted trans girl here! Need some advice	"Heyy! So I recently have come to grips with the fact that I am, in fact, very trans. I could really do with some advice if you could spare the time. The main two obstacles (at least in terms of people) are both my dad and people at school. My dad appears to have the perception that trans people don't exist and that my cousin, who is also trans (ftm) and wore a binder for the entire last time we saw him, isn't trans bcus he wants top surgery, but not anything else. My dad openly mis-genders him, often on purpose, because of this, and has openly said that he doesn't want a trans child. Secondly is the people at school; who are very LGBT phobic and have not hesitated to beat people in the LGBT community. Ngl, these things kinda keep me in the closet rn.

&#x200B;

Sorry if this was too long, or these problems seem quite simple, or it seems like it was written like a bot. I wrote this in one take and have a tendency to write like this. Any advice, or even just an upvote, would be greatly appreciated."	"For now I would stay closeted. Sounds like you are in a tough spot. I am sorry to say ,but do not risk your life. Enjoy being trans on a personal level until your situation now becomes better
Maybe talk to your cousin's parents and ask them for advice?
Idk your family situation, but hopefully the rest is more progressive than your father.
Maybe try going on puberty blockers, your father shouldn't be able to notice that.
Just don't put yourself in danger, stay safe, better to be misgendered than homeless, especially sinse there's a pandemic going on.
Whatever you do, good luck :)
Whatever you do, you must proceed as though there will be no chance of changing anybody's mind. As long as you're dependent on your parents for material support your dad will not support your transition. You must make a plan to transition on your own, which means extracting yourself from dependency.

If you can get a job you can start saving up for hormone therapy, and if you can manage it it's possible to self-administer those hormones. If you can move away for college or uni that would be ideal.

Find local trans/gender-diversity support groups. Any middle-to-major city will have one. Good groups are very discrete and supportive. Bad groups are still discrete but insular and cult-like.

Remember that no matter what anyone else says, you know who you are. You are the expert in your life and nothing anyone says will change that.
OK so, I've got this :

And I hate what I'm about to say. But I've seen too many people go wrong to not say this to you. Please don't go shouting about your trans ness from the rooftops just yet. Also don't deny who you are in yourself. But maybe wait until you have a more enlightened peer group before you go all out.

Some people are very lucky, and you should not have to put up with anti lgbt people family or otherwise. And lots of people are trans without the bottom surgery. That's totally irrelevant.

All I'm saying is, be cautious. Be yourself and don't suppress who you are, but don't get caught doing it until you're sure it won't mean social suicide?
If you could move school to a better one would be good but I'd bet you thought of that already so it seems maybe just say closeted.
I would wait until you're old enough to move out, or start hrt secretly if you can."	ipaobd	trans	19	0.89	2020-09-09 06:16:09
I am NOT your Token Trans [possible triggers]	"Needed to get this off of my chest is a relatively safe space, so feel free to ignore this. There's a lot to read.

There is a woman I've known for a little over 15 years now. Since this person is well-known and respected around the world for her work, let's just call her Anne.

Anne is one of those people that developed a Cult of Personality. There were many, many people that wanted to be near her just to be near her. It completely went to her head, to where she can't comprehend why some people just don't like her.  Add a dash of egotism and narcissism, and you have a recipe for someone who controls the narrative, because who would believe that such a nice and wonderful person would mistreat anyone?

But that's exactly what Anne did. She made a grand show of welcoming me into her little group all those years ago, but as it became clearer that I wasn't going to be just another blind worshipper, I was slowly phased out. I was kept at arm's length for years, rarely invited to her gatherings, had to constantly remind her of my contributions to her projects, and any creative collaboration I wanted to do with Anne was done entirely by me then rubber-stamped without so much as a glance. She threw me table scraps in the form of side projects no one had much interest in. When she started on her big passion project, I was out completely. So far out, that when I casually responded to a FB group question years later that I was part of a project that spawned Anne's passion project, she violently shouted that there were no others on the project and never would be. My very best friend at the time was on that project, eventually she stopped talking to me as it went on.

Here's the big twist: all of this happened YEARS before my egg cracked (and I promise I'm getting to the point).

Flash back a couple of years ago. A mutual friend reminds Anne that I exist, and convinces her to invite me back in. The person Anne knew had ceased to be, so I decided to be the better person and give her a second chance with the new me. I tell her I'm trans. Almost instantly, it was the same song and dance. Anne told everyone how awesome I was, then went right back to radio silence with her faithful followers. All the alarm bells were going off in my head, but I forged on and made a name for myself this time. Made new friends, started new projects, I'm even leading a project team. Then out of the blue, after ignoring me for well over a year, Anne starts sending me DMs practically begging me to join her projects--but never the other way around. And just last night, the cherry on the s\*\*t sundae, out of the blue I get offered a permanent position on one of those 'table scrap' projects she deigned hand me all those years ago. One which I hated with every fiber of my being.

Come to find out that Anne has been accused fairly recently of being transphobic/TERF. Wanna guess who the only T is in the LGBTQ+ portion of this project community?

I am NOT your token trans, Anne. I am NOT something to be used to absolve you from public scrutiny. I am NOT to be held up to say, ""See?? I hire trans people! I'm not phobic!"" just so you can sleep knowing everyone loves you. I am a human being, with feelings and emotions, which you have constantly ignored and belittled for as long as I've known you.

F\*\*k you, Anne."	Fuck Anne. Anne's a bitch.	rb7prt	trans	17	0.88	2021-12-07 19:45:38
i don't feel trans enough to call myself trans	"Idk, I guess like the title says I don't think I'm trans enough to be trans, or at least non-cis. I've been feeling like this for a while now, and been wanting to tell my friend that I'm not cis (been using gender queer on different online spaces for a while) for a few months but been scared cuz I don't want him and friends to think I'm copying him and our other trans friends, and even if I wanted to come out, my father is a bit trans phobic and I don't want to deal with him either (I'll have to wait like a little over year and a half til I can move out). 

And everyone I know knows me as girl and the name I've been using but I would like to change my name, and it'll still be derived from my full name like my nickname, just the new one (I've also been using it here on Reddit and other online spaces) is just more neutral. And I don't really like or feel connected with she/her the more and more I think about it, and internally cringe when I hear people refer to me, but like I'm back at being scared and worrying about copying and trying to claim I'm something that isn't mine to claim. 

And idk if I want to be a man, maybe non binary or something, but like I feel like I'm not fitting and can't because of everything. I want to tell my friend this stuff, maybe ask him to use different pronouns or something but I'm just so scared, worried and don't want to wrongly claim a space in a place where I shouldn't be. And he's now even been hinting at me being an egg or having a gender crisis, which of course I denied, but he also know I go on r/egg_irl frequently (yes, a totally cis thing to do) but even with all that and the knowledge that he and other will support me, I still don't feel like I can be trans/non-cis, because  just not enough, or maybe faking this whole thing 

Sorry that this post is so long, sometimes I just need to go off and type a bit."	"it is super common for trans people to be friends even before their egg cracks, honestly your friend will likely just be stoked to have another person on the team lol. at least thats been my experience so far.
[removed]
Why not just try it out? If the label ‚Äútrans‚Äù or ‚Äúnonbinary‚Äù starts to feel weird, you can always change your mind. You can tell your friend ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm not 100% sure, but I think I‚Äôm trans. Can you call me Jamie and use they/them?‚Äù
I definitely felt like this when I found out I was trans. I thought to myself I‚Äôm not trans and even if I‚Äôm trans I‚Äôm not ‚Äútrans‚Äù enough and I‚Äôm just copying people because it‚Äôs a phase. It takes time to figure out who you are and I‚Äôm still in that position. I have a transphobic family so don‚Äôt come out to people that could hurt you. It‚Äôs better to be misgendered to suffer physical and mental plus emotional pain. Come out to people you trust please, it helps telling them what you prefer to be called and what pronouns you use. My name currently was derived from my initials Ian my middle name first and I added my own letter. I like to think of it as if you feel you don‚Äôt belong and are uncomfortable with what your assigned at birth then your trans. You don‚Äôt need surgery to be trans you don‚Äôt need new clothes to be trans you don‚Äôt need anything. You being you is a symbol of being trans and it‚Äôs ok! :) more importantly don‚Äôt be afraid take a step and a  deep breath of being who you are be firm I always correct people with my name and pronouns be a badass too. Much love >3
I hope they will :)
I know I don't have to label myself, it's just sometimes hard not putting a name to what your feeling, or being able to live how you feel. Thank you :)
I'mma try to tell them, just every time I think I can I kinda just freeze up. Thank you tho :)
That means a lot, thank you. It really can be so frustrating sometimes, and every time I try to tell my friends, I kinda just freeze up. Thank you for sharing with me :)"	ynps6z	trans	16	0.81	2022-11-06 13:21:45
