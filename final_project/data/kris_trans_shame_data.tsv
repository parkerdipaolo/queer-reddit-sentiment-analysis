Faith in humanity=restored		"Fantastic story. It proves the quiet majority are ok with us. It's the vocal, poisonous minority causing the problems ❤️❤️❤️
This makes me think of my best friend. He’s a mountain of a man, tattoos and intimidating. He’s done similar things before in other situations. There are more people like this out there and OP’s post is a great reminder. Stay safe everyone. ❤️
Idk about this one. It has big ""and then everybody in the target stood up and clapped"" energy 😕
I hope this actually happened❤
As millennials and Gen. Z age more I think being trans will stop being an issue
Aww 🥹
Lotta people saying this is a fake story.  Is it? I duno, but personal experience says it \*absolutely\* could happen.  Take for example my godfather.  He's a 6'5"" tower of a man.  Goes by Oger to basically anyone who knows him. Loves geeky things and helped run a D&D radio podcast for nearly 20 years.  Awesome dude who'd come to conventions and run panels, and partook in LARP on a regular basis.  Made himself a BFH (Big F\*\*\*ing Hammer) out of a dowel rod and two couch cushions, and would swing it around without a care.  And he's defended me in the past.  Not someone to mess around with.  He's also a giant teddy bear, and is one of the kindest people around.  Loves to tease his godchildren (so I saw plenty of ribbing in my early years), but when I came out to him, his first words were ""If \*anyone\* tries to bother you about this, let me know. I'll be there.""  For how little I saw him (maybe once a year, which I really wish could be more often), he's been one of my biggest supporters.  
Point is, these people can exist.  
Is this real? it could be.  And for me, knowing that somewhere out there, someone either hopes it is, or has experienced this, keeps me positive.
Ima meat mountain too. As an ally I will always stand up for the oppressed, and stand up to bullies. Good for this guy.
We need more human mountain guy in the world
I find it a little comedic that it says the picture was deleted to me.
it's deleted damn
Looks like it was removed
The mountain man: protector of trans people, destroyer of bigotry
Resume: we need an army of mountain men
what story? it says it was deleted..
Has anyone got a link to this, looks like the link has been deleted 😔
Deleted already 😔
I can’t view the image :(
and then everyone clapped!
And then you start to read the comments. And then the user and post got deleted..
:/
What was the original post? Seems it got deleted
Got removed
I've seen this happen at punk shows, and it's always a delight.
The good ending.
Wonderful! I'm sure glad we have people out there willing to stand up for what's right. People can be really shitty.
I've seen this post before and it makes me wanna work out and be big muscly dommy mommy so bad
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I needed this today
Back in 2002 my ex and I were at the Costco near Modesto, CA when we saw/heard this guy verbally abusing his wife and kid. He was being REALLY fucking mean and loud and finally I had enough of it and went over to do something about it. I'm 6'5 and 1/2 inches tall irl and at the time I was about 400lbs. I'm not a violent person OR into confrontation but my mom was abused by my former step-dad and all I could think of was the misery he put her through. 

I walked over to him and told him he needed to start treating her and his kids better. That they deserved to have a good dad who respected them and not one who treated them like shit. I was terrified he'd attack me and worried he'd take it out on them but his wife and kid seemed somewhat relieved his attention was on someone else. 

The rest of the customers either looked on not knowing what to do or say or did their best to ignore things but I heard at least a few voices backing me up. I followed the guy out the door and tried to tell his wife my email but they just wanted out of there. 

I like to think that if I did something like that now something like what OP posted would happen. What I did is why I feel something like this is more than possible as people these days are way more socially conscious and willing to take a stand. We've seen it with the Pink Pussy hat movement, Black lives matter, the Trans awareness movement, and speaking for myself if I was ever in another situation like the one I was in back then you're goddamn right I'd speak up again.
this literally brings me to tears of happiness
The high levels of RESPEC emanating from meat mountain brings me so much joy :)
Human Mountains are often the kindest people I've found. Not always obviously but I've met a lot of big dudes who don't have anything to prove and they are just chill.
And then everyone clapped.
I love when people remember that they are people, not maggots. Such rare situations these days.
Based mountain

He even asked her for her pronouns as a courtesy to her. Super based guy. I wanna find him so that I can thank him for being such a fantastic ally.

We need more guys like that
Omg!!! 😍
Perfect :)
Oh my fckn god is so wholesome   
Hope all the best to the ""Human mountain""
Noooooo I’m at a family gathering why would you make me cry like this😭
G
🥹😭🥹🥹💕
I'm not crying - you are!
i love this so much but this 100% did not happen
And then the whole store clapped
the bigots will say shit like ""the transes are making us be nice to people and use their pronouns""
That made me tear up but I know it's probably fake
“I don’t care how many inspiring stories I hear, I am not believing in humanity.”
Taking the time to ask for her pronouns in the middle of it was fucking brilliant!
That is so so so so so wholesome!!! 🏳️‍⚧️💮🏳️‍⚧️
LARP
Im cis rn but questioning the gender hence why am I here but maybe if I am just cis I should work on becoming a mountain or at least a hill so I could maybe help some people. New goal obtained
Wow,I had a pretty dysphoric day with thought of wanting to eradicate humanity and some imposter syndrome.but this make me feel a bit better. Thanks
Woop woop!
 im not a huge dude (cis fem) and neither is my friend (nb), but we once did the same a few months back when we were leaving a store and heard a security guard deliberately misgender a trans woman.
Legit both stopped, turned around and ""awww hell no you didnt"" and made him apologise
man i wish this was real
this is a cute fake story
I mean I like the situation
But it really feels like a and everyone clapped moment lol
This gives me faith back in humanity.
im sorry but i don't believe this for a second
Big bro is wholesome chad 💪💪💪💪🤟🤟🤟👏👏👏👏 glad our fellow sister was supported
Omg that’s the kind of heroism we need. Thankyou burly tattooed man
Omg that’s the kind of heroism we need. Thank you OP, thank you burly tattooed man.
My best friend restored my faith in small town humanity. Customers walk in and harass a coworker of hers that's trans. They don't intend on ordering anything (its a fast food place). So my friend stands up to them and tells them to gtfo and they do. She then calls her boss (the owner, my friend is the mgr) to self report and he said not to tolerate bs like that and not to worry about punishment!
Has the post been deleted...?
Aww thats fantastic see most are okay with us❤❤ if only government sees that 🥺🥺
✨💖✨ real men protect trans women ✨💖✨
This.....people think they hate the one thing that makes us amazing.  So awesome that someone stood up for one of us. This makes my day.
I’m not crying you’re crying!!
Very true! It’s almost as if reality and the Internet aren’t the same thing 😁
Depends on where you are.  That's not the case in a lot of places, like the (US) South.  This was in Washington state
My best friend is 6'3"" with a shaved head, big red beard, and biceps the size of my head. He works food service and enjoys baking and taking things apart and putting them back together in his spare time. He has helped many a friend move out of a shitty ex's place. He is also VERY popular at gay bars for some reason despite being (mostly) straight.
Your best friend is great!! 🏳️‍⚧️💮
Samee. My best friend is huge compared to me and never lets *anyone* fuck with me. He’s actually a big softy tho and would prolly get his ass kicked if it ever came to a fight lol
And that trans woman? Was Albert Einstein.
It does. But I hope it's real
I don't even care anymore. I need something that can make me feel like the world isn't completely shit, even if it's fake. I can only handle so much awful reality, day after day. 

So in my fanfic of the world, there's now a place where if you're in Target, transphobes will get called out and a big mountain of a man will storm over and demand that your pronouns be respected. And that makes me feel better.
It's true, I was the Target.
I feel it but imma just chose to believe this for the sake of my mental health lmao
I don’t know, I think the “then everybody clapped” stories tend to involve the poster or family/friends as the hero rather than a random stranger. Either way I choose to believe it’s true, because I need a bit of positivity today!
Well, there are already constant fake stories to make the queer community look bad, so I don't mind a positive one every once in a while, real or not.
Real or not, I appreciate the thoughts.
It's old too.  I've seen this a dozen times.  Even if it happened, it's not a new thing.  Hope it's real though
Unquestionably a r/thathappened submission
Idc, still sweet <33 uwu
People still think being gay is wrong, but it’s a much smaller minority than what it felt like back in the ‘00s.

I hope it does stop being an issue altogether, though.
There's still plenty of transphobe in those generations as well.  Some of the most vocal and high profile people spewing hatred are only in their 30's, some in their 20's
I'm not a mountain but I can fight too (I'm a tiny surprise package)
Same yeah. Says the image is ""probably deleted""
It’s real, I’m the huge buff tattoo’d guy /s
Punks and metal heads are (mostly) great (ignoring nsbm etc).
For the last part the reason is bears (🤤🤤🤤)
He's a wonderful person! Congrats on being friends with him!! ✨🏳️‍⚧️
*Alberta.
And now you know, The rest, of the story.
As long as it encourages more people to stand up against the terrorist threat from the conservatives I'm good with lies that paint heroes for the trans community.
same
And I was the tattoo on his left bicep
But overall, the non-transphobic majority seems more willing to stand up against hate when we see it than our parents were.
Hee hee me too! I love this description
As a Metalhead, can confirm.
Of course, how could I forget the pioneer behind estrogen=mc^2
This. In my imaginary world, these stories inspire people to live them out, and then we have more people standing up and saying something in these awful situations

Transphobic Principal	"I am a trans school social worker supporting a non-binary student. When the student started at my school, I sent an email to staff letting them know the student's preferred name and pronouns and that the parents were not supportive. This is allowed in my state and supporting trans students even when parents don't agree is required by law.

My principal took disciplinary action against me. I fought it. I won.

Lots of students have been coming to me with questions about the new student and themselves. So I taught a lesson today on gender identity. Real basic, real tame. 

The principal walked through while I was teaching. Next thing I know, someone from the Central Office is in my office asking about an inappropriate lesson I taught. Then I get an email from the superintendent that I am on administrative leave until further notice. Finally, the principal sent an email to the ENTIRE staff (including cooks and custodians) publicly shaming me for teaching a lesson on (get this) sex ed without prior approval.

I have never been so outraged and humiliated and words I don't even have. I am facing possible job loss for teaching students about people like myself in a state where that is allowed.

I just want to crawl in a hole. She has only been principal for 2 years but they have been hard years. She has treated me like garbage from day one. Quiet harassment by not including me and blocking me from important information regarding my students. I am exhausted and emotionally spent.

I had already planned on quitting after this year. Now I might sue for gender discrimination. She should have just waited four weeks."	"Sue the ever loving shit out of her and the district.
Wow. I'm not a lawyer, so take this with a grain of salt but I wonder not only about suing but also about going to the press.
Please sue, please don’t quit. I wish I had someone like you in my school growing up
REPORT LGBTQ/HIV DISCRIMINATION

https://action.aclu.org/legal-intake/report-lgbtqhiv-discrimination

Contact the ACLU and tell your story. They may be able to help directly or they may refer you to another organization but even if they have to leave you to find your own lawyer(s), they can probably point you to some of the best in the field.
Find legal help and absoultely *ruin* her
Sue. Please on behalf of those students. Sounds like a massive jackass.
Don't know where you are, but if you have a teacher's union, call your rep. immediately.
I’d say it’s time to contact the ACLU, HRC, the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund, and any other national transgender legal advocacy organisation as well as your state’s Attorney General’s Office.  I would bring the fires of hell down upon her head simply for violating the law as well as for blatant discrimination.
I haven't been in education in a while, but I served 8 years in Dallas. ;)
Remember to document everything.
Keep hard copies of emails. I.T. has been weaponized illegally more than once (deleting the server copy of incriminating emails and purging the archives).
Do not start any litigation by going to the press first, it makes you look like an attention seeker and there is no way to control what happens after.
If you have close allies on staff, have them document any private conversations the principal has with them about you.
If you don't have your lesson written out in standard lesson plan format (whatever is common/accepted at your campus), do it. This will become evidence later that you didn't viokate any standards.
Also keep a chain of events that led to the necessity of the lesson, and whichever teachers or other staff participated in giving you class time.
Don't respond to any phone calls, emails, etc. without advice from your union rep first.

On a more personal note, I'm so sorry this happened.  Now you get to be strong for yourself and your students in a way that will have serious policy impact in your district at the least. You are under no moral imperative to fight this; but if you've got the fight in your spirit, fight to win!

Hugs and battle cries. :D
If you're considering suing, you might want to delete this post once you're done with it-- Lawyers won't be happy about discussion on the topic in a public forum or social media.  I had to file suit a few years ago and my lawyer banned me from talking about it anywhere until everything was resolved.

That said, sue her up one side and down the other, for real @@
Same experience, but as a teacher. Fucking bullshit.
Im sorry u r going thru this. That really sucks. get your union working for you. contact the aclu, hrc, and maybe the transgender law center But find a better school in a better state.
Basically, read what everyone else has said, but here’s what I came here to say: Woop, good teacher! Thank you!
If I had someone like you at school I wouldn’t have let my mental health get the way it is, you’re inspirational
so stupid. trans-status is nothing to do with ""sex-ed"".
Time to get rich. Sue the shit outta her. Start documenting every incident, time, date, witnesses, location. Talk to your union rep. Get a tiny recorder or use your phone and start recording all conversations with this person. It's time to send her packing.
Take some time and make detailed notes about exactly what you taught. If there is a proper investigation done. That will be part of your side of the story.
You're lucky that it's legal in your area. Take her to court and have her done for discrimination. Good luck! <3
Sounds like a Title VII claim if I’ve ever heard one but the fuck do I know? 💁🏻‍♀️ unfortunately I can’t give legal advice legally so…
Sue her ass into the ground!
sue. ruin her life
""The trans are opressing us!11!""

_Proceeds to basically fire someone who tries to educate people._
OP SUE THE DISTRICT, YOU HAVE A CASE, YOU CAN WIN AND MAKE A POINT OF IT
Op sue them, go to the press and report them to the highest legal authority.
Sue. Go for it. Big stink lots of noise. Your face on the nightly news, magazine articles both supporting and eviscerating. Strangers judging you and all your decisions. 
I don’t have the mug for it but you might. Just please consider all your options before you open a Nonanonymous shit can. I support you whatever you decide.
Honestly, just to be petty at this point, I’d reply all to that email and explain how the principal is factually incorrect about the sex ed thing and being publicly discriminatory in a district where this is totally legal.
In addition to discrimination, you also may be able to press charges for retaliation if you recent fought and won against previous disciplinary actions. Retaliation cases are often super easy to win with
If there is a lgbt or trans association in your area, contact them. Some are well equiped to mail the principal with some scary and true legal arguments saying that they are not respecting the rights of people, etc.
id try to find a new school. even if in that district a new school should be better
Sorry for your troubles.  Some times admistrators are POS, not Parent over shoulder.
Are you in Florida by any chance?

Edit: also thanks. Really. Hateful people suck, and also you helped just by taking the kid seriously, even if the principal doesn’t. That stuff makes a real difference, especially when it’s harder to find.
seriously, you should sue.
Please sue that bitxh.

I'm sorry you've been put through this ♥️
Sounds like a shitty principal. Gather with board of trustees vote the
I am a trans teacher and that infuriates me. Metaphorically claim her head by suing the shit out of her, the district and anyone else you can make this their problem. Scorch the earth.
DO THIS OP

what they did is majorly discriminatory and they can get in trouble for this
Unfortunately, this is the way.
That would be fabulous. She loves news stories about how wonderful she is. Calls the newspaper herself every time she thinks she's done something great. I will keep that as a possibility.
This is so important. Someone is calling, you should answer. Don't let them chase you off, you chase them off. Let her know this kind of behavior will not be allowed anywhere. Protect yourself but more importantly, protect your students. They need you. Do it for them. This is your calling.
Yeah this. Definitely do what you need to for your own mental health here, but if you can do it this is a fight worth having.
Obliterate her
Sounds like the principal overstepped the scope of their responsibilities and will now cost the district money in settling an unfair dismissal lawsuit.
You weren't teaching sex ed you were answering questions about gender dysphoria.
If students are educated why you're trans when they are younger they are less likely to be discriminatory as adults.
One of the first things I did when I received the administrative leave emails. My rep is amazing and was so helpful with the first issue.
This us great advice IMHO. 

Also came here to say ""hugs and battlecries"" is the absolute perfect motto for these times.


Pure genius.
[deleted]
I will share that with my union rep. Because I feel that it is retaliation (as well as discrimination).
Not in Florida or Texas or Alabama 

It is legal in my state to teach gender affirming lessons and to use preferred names/pronouns at school even without parent consent.

I will always advocate and openly support my trans, gay, and neurodiverse students.
This is the only education bullies understand
unfortunately indeed. Most people never learn until there are dire consequences imposed
Now it got a lot sweeter, the media loves drama and the that fact she contacts them so much only increases the chances the media will make this a big deal, greatly shaming her.
Calling the newspaper about yourself as a teacher shouldn’t be allowed. It only makes her look like she’s teaching for all the wrong reasons
Ohhh, she’s a malignant narcissist. That explains everything. You have the power to rock her world and give her the proverbial punch to the face she never got.
The fact that there was a first issue at all means that you should absolutely sue. You're one of the few in a position to stand up against this kind of abuse; please do so.
No doubt, anyplace worth its salt has procedures in place (besides the admin event log) to prevent shenanigans. I know that Mimecast requires two full admins to confirm a delete, and it still logs the event.

I would think the real risk is a middling-size district with a struggling IT department still maintaining an Exchange server, with more admins than they keep track of and a principal proactive enough to make the request before any word of legal hold wafts through.

Without becoming slanderous, my district had some pretty glaring issues with corruption/internal matters at the time, like switches going missing from campuses to be auctioned on ebay or IT employees getting fired the day before payday and never getting their last check.

I agree it's a small chance, but it's not nonzero and the stakes are quite high. I guess the other angle here is to assume that email access may be revoked at any time, and therefore not rely on a digital copy as evidence.
It's truly necessary that we make an example of them to spread the message that transphobia cannot be tolerated. I hope OP does this, because the schools, and everyone, need to learn that gender identity and sexual identity are far from the same thing. The most common misconceptions are that your biological sex and your gender are associated at all, or that discussing your gender is related to who you are attracted to. It's an ignorance that must be turned into an education or we will remain in the dark ages of oppression forever.  
  
  So until the communities that surround all of the schools understand that gender itself is not a sexual topic, just because they've been miseducated about ""perversions"", we must continue to stand our ground.  
  
  OP, to act legally is not only for your own protection or benefit, but it is for the protection and benefit of all the trans people, and most importantly the students, who are surrounding this district.
Well that's good then, because the principal is indeed teaching for all the wrong reasons."	ueck0q	trans	2167	0.95	2022-04-29 03:13:54
Kendrick Lamar shows trans support	"His new album dropped last night and has interestingly been met with a lot of criticism about his “ignorance” towards trans issues. His song “auntie diaries” specifically delves into two people, one his ftm uncle, and the other his mtf cousin. The f slur is used multiple times in the song, but when you look at the lyrics and listen to what he is talking about, it reveals his ignorance as a child, one that was put upon him through society’s norms of shaming lgbt individuals. The rest of the song has him directly defending their right to live with my favorite few lines from it —

“The day I chose humanity over religion
The family got closer, it was all forgiven
I said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better
Mistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different
See, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound”

I would love to hear y’all’s thoughts on the song, because right now there seems to be a divide by fans on its release"	"Mainstream artists trying to deal with subjects like this always ends up a bit janky.. but he has a history of working through really dificult topics in a clever and profound manner. I hope he tries again in future, further enlightened.
I kind of get him using the f-slur, because the lyrics make it clear he used to say if often when he was an ignorant kid in middle school, but I draw the line in deadnaming Caitlyn jenner and misgendering his uncle and cousin

Now, I'm not a native english speaker, so the f-slur might not have the same impact for me as it does for you
I listened. It was really uncomfortable. I get what he was trying to do, but all the same, that misgendering and deadnaming was a lot to have to deal with. And I kept thinking about my siblings kids, and how without REALLY paying attention, the message is lost and most of what you’re hearing is just ignorance. And a lot of people don’t REALLY pay attention to songs, they’re just sort of happening in the background or you’re half tuned in. At least when I was my siblings kids age that was the case for me. So idk if it’ll be helpful for anyone in the trans community ultimately tbh. Time will tell I guess. I don’t think I’ll listen again though.
I can see where he's trying to come from, but the use of misgendering and deadnaming did kinda put me off. 

Would I listen to it again, probably not. A good first attempt, though
Step in the right direction for hiphop being as homophobic as it is even today. So close to being good but like maybe he should say deadnaming when talking specifically in the past it would be kinda fine but he just does it through the whole thang so... but honestly we need to take what we can get in this type of music especially with people like Dababy just outwardly being homophobic with little repercussions.
I understand that some people may be uncomfortable with him using the f-slur and misgendering/deadnaming at all, and that's just a difference of whether context changes if people should say it at all, which idk up to you what you think there, I don't know what I think yet. But if you listen to the song and read the lyrics I personally think it's pretty clear that these actions are being directly judged and presented as ignorant and at the end of the song the subject of the song's view on using that language has changed.

idk, y'all are absolutely right to disagree with him using that language, I think it's alright in context but that's just me
I think it's a really good song.  I think the use of the f-slur was pretty excusable because it wouldn't have the same impact, or maybe even any impact if he didn't.  

The deadname / misgendering stuff is like, tone deaf I guess. But I also feel like it's kind of the internal monologue that a lot of cis people probably have when a friend or relative transitions.  I would have a hard time believing many of my friends early transition didn't have to think to themselves ""\[deadname\] is \[name\] now.""  And I think that's ok for people to think because it feels to me like a necessary step in relearning who their friend really is.

I think it's interesting because I think it's a great song because it's not about the trans person, really.  It's about acceptance, and particularly acceptance in the black community, which has extremely low LGBT (particularly transgender) acceptance in general, which is one of the reasons the mortality rates for black trans people is so high.  And I Think the best part of the song is that it's about how that isn't ok.  That it's not *just* enough to accept trans people.  It's that the author realizing that language matters a lot, regardless of what intent you have behind it, and that the framing and comparison with the use of the N-slur that everyone should be able to understand.  

I dunno I guess I'm extra sensitive to it because I just went back and listened to one of my favorite rapper's songs, and it had this really really transphobic line with the T-slur in it and it just hit me like... I wouldn't have thought of her as like that but damn.  It hurt hearing that even though it's a 10 year old song at this point.  

Maybe I'm too lenient but I think it's a good song and it's more than just performative in my mind.  It was only 7 or 8 years ago that gay got to be somewhat normal in rap.  And this is a huge step forward for trans life in rap.
I liked it, and the rest of the album as well. Auntie Diaries seems like really reflective, honest art.
Get your rotten tomatoes ready!

It takes time to wrote out in depth analysis on music, and it’s almost 4 AM, so here are my very, very simplified thoughts.

Artist should be allowed to make controversial music. Even if you think this was a misstep, the overall messege is one of acceptance. If someone still needs to learn what a trans man/woman even is, of all things, or how to properly gender someone, then I’ll gladly do it because I’d rather correct ignorance than try to withstand the flood of hate and violence being committed against us daily. Not everyone has to feel the same as I, but if this song nudges the culture just a little bit more towards acceptance, then I’m all for it.

A soecific point I’d like to raise is his use of the F-slur. Personally, I don’t mind him using it in this instance. It’s clearly not being used in malice or mockery. He draws parralels between cis people using it and white people aaying thr N-word, which I think is good, and gives people a more accessable route to understanding why it hurts us so much. At the end of the day, these words are just sounds to a lot of people, but hopefully this gets the gears turning for a lot of people.

We deserve more. We deserve more than the paltry musings of a cis-het multi-millionare mainstream rapper, but this is what we have to work with.
honestly i think his heart was in the right place with this track, it just feels really... weird?
Sooo, it’s different, but not really different from Kendrick’s past songs. I believe it’s in good faith and I hope he got permission to dead name repeatedly on the song. When he uses the wrong pronouns i believe Kendrick is speaking in past tense. Personally i think the song proved the point Kendrick was going for and it’s nice, i don’t see an issue with it unless he didn’t get permission from the two family members Kendrick was talking about.
I'm not surprised people are confused a lot of Kendricks music is dramatically ironic like this. see: HUMBLE
I really don’t get why people are justifying him using the “f slur”. It is not his place to use that word, ever, no matter the context, he could’ve expressed the same exact concept without the slur. Imagine if a white person used the “n word” in a song, no one would dare justify them saying “oh but in that context blah blah blah…”, like no. 

And don’t even get me started on the misgendering, deadnaming, triggering language used to refer to trans experences.

The thing is, in my opinion, we don’t owe gratefulness to every single cishet person who just acknowledges our mere existence in a song, especially if they do it in such a superficial, ignorant way. The bar is in hell and we deserve way better than that. If this is how they’re gonna talk about us, then no thank you, they shouldn’t even bother as far as I’m concearned
I enjoyed the song, it can be a bit difficult to listen to from a trans perspective, I posted my thoughts to this sub a bit earlier. You can read them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/uot6b9/auntie_diaries_kendrick_lamar/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).
in the current era, any cis person trying to be trans inclusive is like a child who came in last in a spelling be. glad you tried but you sucked
He’s trying to be supportive but not too supportive, that could affect his career and I get it, would I love it if he trashed himself and his wallet for me? Yes. But he needs to go this slowly and carefully, unfortunately Luke warm transphobia is one of the few ways hyper cishet men can slowly start to be fully supportive without blowing themselves up.
From a cis persons perspective, the song would be supportive, but with the misgendering in it, it feels gross to me
See my other comment!
I don't think using the f-slur is acceptable either. You can show you've changed without using the actual word. If a white person made a song about how they used to be racist and use the n-word, everyone would (rightfully) lose their minds.

It is hard to listen to, I completely understand. I cried when I heard it the first time, but I don’t think the blame should be put on Kendrick for people to get his message, it’s his life and he puts it into lyrics. The dead naming to me sounded like when he was still coming to terms with it, and how through that ignorance he loved his family enough to A. Confront people who don’t believe in trans people’s existence and b. Make a song about it in a genre of music where homophobia is rampant and this topic has not been touched nearly at all. All I meant for this post was that he is making strides in this field of influence to say that trans people deserve love, where people are not going to want to hear it anyway
It’s not on purpose. Whenever he uses deadnames, the verbs are also in the past tense. Kendrick’s albums are less about music and more about storytelling, which is why he calls his albums “short films” instead of albums.

While it might be offensive, he is telling the story of his life through how he used to see the world vs. how he sees it now
See my other comment!
given the responses that have filled up my inbox, I may wish to revisit this...
Are you talking about Tierra whack with the other song that was disappointing? Lol. I was so bummed when I heard that line
I totally get what you're saying, but I don't think this song was really intended for trans/LGBT people, we already know about our own experiences and our own hardships and we don't need a cis person to tell us. 

As someone who's really into rap and hiphop, having a mainstream artist with a large following of fans who respect him and his opinion do a song in support of trans rights is a pretty big deal. Most of these people aren't those who are going to listen to trans or LGBT artists, most of them are still from communities engrained deeply in homophobic sentiments and most are people who probably haven't even heard a song tackle these kinds of topics before.

I'm not saying the song was perfect, but for the audience it was intended for, I really think it's a big deal for a major artist to dedicate an entire song to defending trans rights and to appealing to a crowd that doesn't want to listen to it or acknowledge trans people as anything but fringe weirdos. So yes, he has learning and growth to do, and yes if you're an LGBT person who isn't really vested in the rap music scene I get how this song can seem pretty unprogressive, but idk I felt like it was a really big deal more than some people here recognise and it definitely moved me.
So we should just...keep hating you? Wtf
uhh... what? I think you should do more than a Google search on Kendrick before you make assumptions on his past and what his intentions are with regards to this record and monetary status

Anyway, just wanted to let you know Kendrick acknowledge his/our hypocrisy.
I trust Kendrick's fan to listen carefully to the lyrics.
No, Jean Grae.

It's a line in Hater's Anthem which isn't a *new* song but I've always seen her as a really really good lyricist and progressive otherwise.

I think a straight girl is flirting with me.	"This is both good news and bad news.

Good news: Someone is flirting with me.

Bad news: I'm a trans girl.

The person in question fully knows that I am trans. She has used my preferred name and pronouns without fault since I came out.

I know sexuality is a spectrum and all that, but she is firmly on the heterosexual end of said spectrum.

If I wasn't trans, I would pursue a relationship with her, cause she's really pretty, intelligent and has a great personality. Just a shame about the *minor* incompatiblity.

Is it possible to hire someone to sort this for me? (Joke.)

Number of edits cause I'm indecisive about what to write: 3."	"If she’s flirting with you, and accepting then I doubt she’s all that straight. I’d just let it develop
If she's accepting you as the woman you are, honey, she isn't hetero.   


Honestly, have a heart to heart conversation, woman to woman about this, if she actually likes you for you,  then don't let all these imposed labels get in the way of something that could be great.
Unless she's told you she's hetero, darling? It really doesn't sound like she's hetero lol.

Go for it!
I’ve had lots of “Hetero gfs” most ended up coming out later. If she is into you and you’re trans, she probably isn’t as straight as she’s says or maybe even thinks. All sorts of people are repressed and unintentionally act like themselves when they have the proper outlet!
Just go for it, if she likes you the she likes you. It's that simple.
If she's straigt see's and threats you as the woman you are and is interessted in you, than she is indeed not straigt. Do you think she's straight because she does not behave 'queer' or why? There are Bi and Gay Folks out there where you would never guess they are based on behavior. Indeed a lot of Gay Folks have trouble finding a partner because its not obvious in general they're gay. Also, cis straight folks who pursue a 'queer' lifestyle exist.

Just look what happens. Dont think to much, dont assume to much.
I like to think I'm 100% into men. I love men! I dated girls before I came out and definitely only like men now. However........if Cara Delevingne made a move, I would 100% do it. Sometimes there is a special person that you are attracted to and their gender is irrelevant. You might be that person for her. Don't go looking for reasons to screw up good luck.
I really think that sexual orientations are shortcut terms and nothing more. If she likes you and you like her, go for it! That's what matters!
she is flirting with you AND used your name and pronouns? (that means she sees you as a woman)

maybe she isnt so straight after all... or maybe she isnt flirting with you? idk but good luck OP idk what to do either
Then she’s not as straight as she thinks lol
Mate if she likes you she likes you.  Now note - she may consider you something akin to a sister or a really close friend/confidant and never get to the sexual attraction stage (a.k.a girls play flirting with girls).  I have a dozen close friends I used to flirt with knowing fully well nothing is happening.  They married straight guys, some had kids, I went to a few their weddings, they came to mine - including being in my wedding party, the whole shebang.  But if you think she might like you, keep an open mind and be honest about it with yourself and with her.  And definitely don't ghost her if she turns you down.  Be friends and stay friends.

I dont think shes straight
you could talk to her bc it seems like she isn't that straight (respectfully assuming ofc! no one can say that besides herself) 
and maybe you both can find a way to work that out :3

wishing you the best c:
In this case, I wouldn't worry about the label so much.

If she legitimately is into you, and you're into her, then go for it.

Sit down, have a chat, and see where it goes.

You guys can work out all the labels later.
If she's respectful of your identity in every other way, go for it and don't worry too much about what she calls herself. You might be her ""exception"", or she might be calling herself straight because she's *mostly* straight and rounding, or...
Don't over think it. Have fun.
I got hit on while boymoding by the girl at the fish section of the grocery store and didn't know how to feel lmao
As a mostly straight trans guy who still looks very traditionally feminine and isn’t out as anything… I sometimes flirt with trans girls I meet and I worry they have that exact thought process you have right now.

Might not the case for you, but just so you know. Sometimes what seems like a straight girl flirting with you isn’t actually a straight girl.
Just don’t over think it. See where things go if your interested. If you’re not tell her. You miss 100% the shots you don’t take.
A couple years ago I had a straight friend have feelings for me, I felt the same. We talked about things and she basically said that for us to happen I would’ve had to “start liking myself”…I was and am closeted so well…we didn’t start dating🥲
i doubt shes ""firmly on the heterosexual end"" if she uses your pronouns and chosen (presumably) feminine name. just go on a date. or ask her to do your makeup (if shes the makeup kinda gal).
I’ve been in a very similar situation… I (trans M) have been in love with my now ex (cis M) for a long time and had obviously talked to him about his sexuality on the way, with him also always firmly insisting he was a heterosexual man. 

When he started flirting, I was thinking the very same things you are. *Does he not see me as a man? Is he bi? Is he playing with me?* He, too, hasn’t ever misgendered/deadnamed me or, for that matter, ever even known me before my transition. He and my other friends say I’m “un-misgenderable” (which is because, you know, they’ve always known me as a man).

Turns out he was actually flirting and that I did send him into a sexuality crisis. That was good - it meant I was a man to him. We proceeded to become a couple and, I swear to god, his words and actions showed him to be just as crazily in love as I was. He talked about lying awake and grinning widely at night, being all giddy; he trembled when we touched, sighed oh-so-wonderfully as we kissed, his eyes sparkled, it felt so good and real.

Then he broke up. Out of the blue. “I see now that I am straight”, he said, “and I just can’t be with you that way. I cannot admit to others that I have a boyfriend, and I know this hurts you, so it’s best if we were just friends again. I don’t want you to hurt.” (Damn, I started crying again)

There is no morale to this story, I just wanted to tell it. I’m still hurting and I believe talking about it makes it better. We’re still good friends, but you know how this is.

My friend’s experience might explain to you what this girl is feeling or going through. Maybe she’s also going through a sexuality crisis, finding herself attracted to a woman despite being straight (which is completely valid as sexuality isn’t maths. I’ve told that to my ex, but he didn’t feel comfortable dating a man as a straight man.) Just talk to her. Maybe she’s playing with you - which I don’t hope for but is sadly still possible.

I was an experiment of sexuality for my ex, but that doesn’t mean you have to be.
I’ve long insisted that nobody is straight. 
 “heterosexuals” just have a much more narrow/defined “type” that attracts them.

My partner is a great example. She was “heterosexual” up until I transitioned. She’s begun to realize that she’s quite attracted to some women, just not very many. Luckily for me, I’m one of the ones she’s attracted to.

Sometimes that still gets to me, because I still second guess her true attractions under all of that. But we’re poly and she only dates other women now. So I dunno… maybe I was just what it took for her to rethink her attractions? Maybe the same is true for you in this scenario.
>she has used my preferred name and pronouns

If she does all this that means she fully accepts and supports you for who you are.


>she’s really pretty, intelligent and great personality

You seem to like her for who she is.

And you think that being trans is the issue that will keep you two apart? If she’s flirting then she’s into you. Chat with her, go places with her, see how it pans out. 

The worse that can happen is she turns out to be not your type past surface level, the best think that can happen is your start dating.  Why not try :)?
Maam, if shes flirting with u, it might be a joke because a lot of women like to flirt with their girl-friends, but if she genuinely wants to maybe be in a relationship with you, shes not straight😭😭
You'll never know unless you try! If she's being transphobic, then you can dump her then and there. She's probably going through a lot with her sexuality, so seeing you as a boy might be an excuse she would drop with more self-acceptance. How much you tolerate from her is up to you (obviously).
You should probably double check that she was flirting with you (like ask her if she was), and then just tell her that you're confused because you thought that she was straight. Since she's been accepting, I'd bet that she's realizing that she might not be as straight as she thought was.
It's very gay for girls to flirt with girls and mabey you should point it out if it feels right and see where that goes from there.
Did she say she’s hetero in her words? Hahaha, unless confirmed, nobody is hetero🤪🤪
That sounds like a good relationship with extra steps
First, so *IF* she's interested in you, and understands you're trans, then it's s unlikely she is ""firmly"" heterosexual.

Second, flirting doesn't necessarily indicate sexual or romantic interest. Straight women flirt with other straight women, gay men flirt with straight women, straight men flirt with gay men. Straight men don't typically flirt with other straight men because of homophobia, but other than that flirting without interest is normal.

Third, if you're interested in her, flirt back when she flirts and see how far it goes. Even if she's not actually into you, it can be fun and informative.
Hmm. She knows that you are trans. She is accepting of that fact. She is flirting with you. You like her back… gee it’s almost like she knows who you are and wants to date you or something like that. Shame we will never find out


Ok but seriously go for it! It is clearly not an issue for her so get this nonsense out of your head and enjoy a good thing.
One of my current partners thought she was straight until I started transitioning. 

She had a crush on me pre-transition, I came out, and apparently her thought process basically went “X is actually a girl. How does this change my feelings about her?………
“It.. doesn’t… 
“I don’t think I’m as straight as I thought I was…”


So the girl you’re talking about could be in a similar situation :)

Or it could be ‘close friend play flirting’ rather than ‘I want a relationship flirting’

Talking about it directly & maturely is probably a smart idea :)
I think I lot of girls like girlslikeus. I was told it’s because they feel safe with us and we kinda ,maybe , know what we’re doing , giggles 🤭 🙈🙈🙈🙈
I’ll be the guy that says, “spaghetti is straight until it gets wet.” Seriously, she likes you, for you!
I had a lesbian fall for me, and I was in deep smit, too. It was long-distance, and every time we met, she would go weird on me. Tears in her eyes. Very little contact. Great conversation, but there was a clear barrier.

Over the phone and text, things were very hot. She would call just to hear my voice and talk about anything at all. This went on for months until she asked me to come over for the weekend.

I thought, ""This may be it. We'll profess our love, that barrier will come down, and we can start a proper relationship.""

We had BBQ asparagus and portobello. Divine. She had a glass of wine, and I drank a Moscow mule. I was a teensy bit sloshed over it. Then.... we had a great time as friends. Watched a movie. Went to bed.

The next day, we ate breakfast that I cooked, pan-fried zucchini, red onions, tomatoes, and butternut squash, then went hiking among beautiful forest streams and waterfalls. We came back, showered, ate brekky leftovers, talked and laughed, and then we ate the BBQ leftovers. We watched another movie and talked about it, then went to bed after a long hug.

I cried myself to sleep. What was happening?  Was I doing something wrong?  Who is this woman, because she's not the person I talk to on the phone. She's cold to me.

The next morning, which would be my last day before going home, I awoke with determination in my heart. I've fallen for her and I need to know.

We ate a light breakfast that I don't remember (determined!), then I asked her to sit for a moment to talk.

I asked about what was going on with the tension; the tears; the lack of intimacy that was otherwise so clear in our daily correspondence and phone calls. She told me that she was sorry and that it would take time.

I was surprised, but clearly, there was something else affecting her. I asked if it was about the abuse she'd suffered when she was with someone else. She said that that was part of it. I asked her if she felt safe right now. She nodded, but it didn't feel  genuine. I went over the weekend and asked if she had felt threatened or unsafe at all. She said, ""No, not all."" I gave her some time to say something else, but she didn't.

I offered, ""I really like you and want this to work, but I am going to go now. We can talk after we've both had some time to think about what to do moving forward."" She agreed that was best, and I left.

After getting home and crying a fair bit along the way, I bounced this experience off my bestie, my mom, and my daughter. They all brought up the red flags that I had ignored and said that this was my chance to move on. I knew her. They didn't. There is a really funny, warm, passionate, smart person in there that I want to love.

She called me that night and broke up with me. She said she'd always seen me as a man and couldn't be in a relationship with one again. She said she loves me for being so understanding and not pressing for more when she wasn't ready, but it's never going to happen.

I was so heartbroken. I asserted that I'm not a man. ""I've had my surgeries and started hormones a decade ago. So why lead me to believe that there is something there?"" She apologized but had no good answer other than telling me I'm beautiful inside and out.

She kept calling me, telling me that she couldn't stop thinking about me, but I found my backbone and told her that I was not open to being hurt anymore by her. I asked her to get help for the red flags and also to seek understanding. Holding back that she hadn't seen me as anything other than a man is crazy talk after the months we spent in each other's fantasies and bedrooms over the phone.

I guess I'm still hurt by it. She used to get drunk and call me to tell me that she couldn't get over me and kept telling me how lovely and sexy I am. I asked her if she got any help or did any research on her own. I told her that I couldn't be the one to help her understand that trans women are women because it serves my interests. I didn't want someday to have her thinking that I somehow gaslit her into a relationship.

It was over.

In your case, OP, she's been with you in person.she's still flirting. She recognizes your gender and finds you compelling. Barring any red flags, I'd ask her out before she thinks you aren't interested.

Even if she says no, you will have your answer, and she will understand something about her own actions. Perhaps, upon reflection, she may ask you out if you both keep the flirting going.

Then again, she could be one of those annoying people who assert that they ""flirt with everybody."" ""Microcheating,"" Dr. Frankie called it, if either of you is in a relationship.

Good luck and act slightly more confident than you feel!
There can be exceptions in a person's orientation... I'm basically all about girls, but took a shine to one special man and have had a thing with him for over a decade. 

Before I faced up to being trans I thought of myself as very lesbian with this one awkward exception, and once I had my gender crisis I now think of myself as pretty straight with this one hey-I'm-still-kinda-gay exception...

Also, girls are very much his orientation, except now for me - he's super supportive/sensitive/respectful, and been totally copacetic with me needing to make changes. 

So give her a chance, as long as she's respectful and accepting and understands you.
Girl, if you like each other and accept each other, I say at least try. Like others have said, she may not even be hetero. Even if you both think they're not in to women, you'll either prove yourself wrong and be in a happy relationship or figure out you were right and still be good friends. Just talk to her about it. Now get out there and go, girl!
Maybe she’s not as straight as she thinks? If she’s into you, then that sort of has to be the case or else she’s highly confused, but it sounds like she’s got a good handle on your gender. Lots of ‘straight’ girls aren’t actually, when all is said and done.
Love is love and sometimes we don't know what we like until we try it ... so who knows ... if she's into you go for it lol sounds like you like her enough haha
I think the best option is probably to ask, there are a lot of people who flirt simply because they enjoy the tension. Ask her why she flirts with you, if she likes you, she’ll probably say
Sexuality is both on a spectrum and fluid. People love who they love, and sometimes they don't know what they like until they see it
Its something girls like to do to each other, she could be swinging your way, or just sees you for who you are :)
If she likes you and accepts you as a woman, then it doesn't matter if she is hetero or bi or pan, these are just labels. Go be happy with her!! We live just once
Keep in mind that this is possibly more a sign of trust and feeling safe with you, than a wish to engage beyond flirting. When straight cis women flirt with me (NB) I take it to be a sign of my benignity, rather than a pass at me. I’m probably a safe place to play in new waters.
No reason not to pursue who you like just because you are trans. If she appeals to you, see what works out. Don't be afeered :-)
She might not be as hetero as she once thought she was. People grow and change over time. Some people are just attracted to specific individuals, life is a complicated mess that continually defies our expectations. 

just be friends, be open with your feelings, and see where it goes. You'll figure it out.
If denial is a river in egypt…
Cool tell her
Doesn't sound straight in my book lol, maybe just talk it out to see what these signals are. This'll help you figure out if what you want is to be beaties or well, something more 🥰
i think it's really sweet that she likes you. 💛 maybe she says she's straight, but isn't actually sure of that herself. if she recognizes you properly as a girl and she super likes you, just let things play out and maybe you'll both learn something new. 😊
My sex life improved the day I stopped asking myself about other people's sexuality.  I am trans. I am attractive. Tons of ''straight'' guys and girls find me attractive. I tell them it means they've discovered they're bi. If they know about the genitals before hand then don't worry about the sex. Cis-girls can be tops too. A lit of them enjoy it
If she’s into you, and you’re into her what’s the problem. If you’re not into her tell her that, just be honest.
Don’t overthink it sometimes people are bored and just want to have fun. Or do overthink it because if you’re not super out maybe she’s just confused or sm
Remember labels are, at the end of the day, just that: labels. Does her flirting with you make you feel dysphoric? Does she really see you as a woman? Is she emotionally mature enough to have direct conversation with about some of these topics? Maybe keep those questions in mind and talk to her about it. Maybe flirting is just flirting and that can be fun. Maybe she's feeling some not-so-hetero feelings. Compulsory heterosexuality is a crazy thing, and could be a factor here...
Heart-to-heart conversation sounds best. But also understand the dynamics are different woman to woman. In your situation that would be totally cool too, as that is clear acceptance.

Whatever it is, enjoy the heck out of it.
I don’t think she’s as straight as she says she is. Just see what happens. Have fun.
sexuality is fluid, being straight means nothing when u put time and some understanding in sexuality on top of it
She might think of sexuality as sex organs? If OP has not had GCS.
To misquote a much smarter trans girl than myself “trans people are really good at making more queer people because you literally can’t be straight and find me cute” idk food for thought. Obviously some people just pass
Two thoughts on this:

1: I flirt with my definitely straight girl friends all the time and they flirt back. It’s just fun. This could just mean you’re in the club and fully accepted for who you are. It’s wonderful, enjoy it.
2: She might not be as straight as the two of you think she is. This could be her way of exploring and figuring that out. That’s kinda how my last serious long term relationship started. She firmly believed she was bi, but after dating me she’s firmly lesbian and has only dated women since we broke up.
3: This might be a bad take and I think is the least likely scenario, but there could be a *hint* of fetishization. I really doubt it because it sounds like she absolutely accepts you for your true self but there might be an unconscious disconnect in her brain. Like she sees you as a woman but knows you’re AMAB so knows that sex-wise, you’re both compatible. Again, please no one roast me, but that *could* be happening and she’s unaware
4: Girl just role with it. Sexuality IS a spectrum, and romantic and sexual attraction can be different. Personally, I would never date anyone who identifies as male, but I would sleep with one. Be friends, let the relationship be whatever it is and becomes. And hey, friends turn to lovers, lovers to friends, relationships change and evolve.

Okay I lied I actually had 4 thoughts lol
I think you should ask if her sexual orientation and romantic orientation. 

Maybe she's some kind of bi or panromantic but heterosexual.

BTW, if you like her and can see a promising future with her. Go for it.
maybe she is exploring herself, or perhaps she is heteroflexible
i’d drop her. she only likes you cuz she sees you as a man. doesn’t matter how accepting she seems, if she says she’s straight but flirts with you, that tells you what she thinks about you.
Well if you havent transitioned yet and still appear male, no wonder she may be into you.
My best friend, who knew I was trans at 12 years old, now 15 years later after being in a relationship in 2018-19 and an only sexual relationship in 2011 as sophomores is a gay man. I’m a trans woman, and while we have sexual feelings for each other, I tried explaining how I orgasm and how hrt has given me ultra sensitivity and sexual buttons. He can’t possibly understand, not even cis girls I’ve been told have these sexual buttons
I read the OP differently than you. It seems sufficiently clear to me that the OP has fully assumed her female presentation.
I agree
This... she's probably not as hetero as she thinks and needs to figure that out. Let it happen.
(Just an ally here, so let me know if I shouldn’t be here.) I second this. But I would be sure she’s flirting first. It might just be my dumbass (or cis guy obliviousness)  but it can be pretty hard to tell. And I wouldn’t really go into the hetero part, only we choose our labels and who we are. If she wants to identify as hetero that’s her. Who knows, maybe she’s closeted trans but we don’t know. But OP would just ensure she understands who you are and who you want to be. If she gets it and you like her back congrats you might just have  a significant other.
Double this. Forget all the usual dancing around and be direct with her. Say you're getting these signals and ask what her intentions are.
I second this. My very straight mother would jump on the chance to be with lady gaga. Also probably Margo Robbie, but she actually said Gaga yesterday soo
I chuckled when I was your username. That is all.
Came here to say essentially this. Also, that it seems fairly low risk that she is a chaser/fetishizer. I’d be elated. 

Side note: just googled Cara. She’s awesome!
I know what you mean, but just as a sidenote, there's no such thing as ""mostly"" straight, either she is or she isn't straight
“I do like myself, that’s why I’m transitioning!”
Exactly my thoughts to a “t” except I would add -

Fourth, “touching”.

Is she touching you? Things like touching your arm to “get your attention” to look at something? Better yet, hugging you, holding your hand, fixing your hair, etc. And is the touching happening in every-, or most every-, encounter?

If so, touching is, like, 95% persuasive evidence of attraction, although not 100% dispositive (because cis girls also touch). The key is to get to kissing. Kissing is 100% dispositive.

If she’s not touching you, then you can initiate “friendly” touching and see if she begins to reciprocate. If so, and if thereafter she then begins to initiate the touching, well … .

After a few encounters that involve touching behavior is when I would “talk” to her, gently, about something more (since it seems you want a relationship with her).

First, just tell her you really like her. She what she says. Look in her eyes when she responds. Do her eyes sparkle? Is she fidgeting with her hair and smiling? Is she smiling when she responds? What’s her tone of voice? Does she bite her lip? Does she glance at your lips?

Depending on your feeling from the “I like you” talk - maybe right then, maybe later - ask her if she’s ever kissed a girl. Then ask her if she would kiss you. Many cis girls don’t equate kissing another girl to be “gay”, even though it def is, lol.

If kissing is initiated, I think y’all can figure it out from there. Hugs, Charlotte.
Wow, thank you so much for sharing that.
But what if she’s not straight and is only now becoming conscious of that fact?

To misquote John Lennon, give Love a chance?
I presume this was supposed to be responding to someone?
as a trans person, youre perfectly welcome here :3
Of course you’re welcome, it’s great to see allies here.
then she's not straight
🤷‍♀️

Labels are weird, and attempting to prescribe how they work to other people seldom leads to anything good.
Considering sexuality is a spectrum, ""mostly straight"" has some value as a term, even if it technically doesn't fit the definitions. ""Bisexual with tendencies toward the hetero end of the spectrum"" is a mouthful and might not feel quite accurate either. So I know what you mean, but I don't see the problem with somebody saying they are 'mostly' straight in this context.
Just out of interest, what did John Lennon actually say?
Hmmm, yes. Guess I didn’t sufficiently concentrate re the reply button.
Thank you! I brought cookies and ice cream
[removed]
I understand. It's just that, due to the cultural phenomenon known as compulsory heterosexuality, many bisexual people feel afraid of not being heterosexual due to the social stigma that it carries, so they feel compelled to deny being bi or pansexual, which is just a way our heteronormative culture invisibilizes our existence. So while it is an understandable way of describing oneself, it can also be a form of self-repression, and a way of excluding people who actually belong to the LGBT community from being part of it, which divides us as a group. That's why we should encourage them to embrace the term, in order to accept themselves and feel more comfortable being who they trully are, as part of our community 😊
John said, “Give peace a chance”. That is the title of Lennon’s great anti-war song released in 1969.
Ice cream?! Me want! Please 😫🙏🙏💓
And I’ll take those cookies off your hands, thank youuuu.
There are exceptions for some people. Sexuality is a spectrum and is complicated, don’t force other labels onto people just because you don’t think they’re using the correct one.
[removed]
Once again, sexuality is a spectrum and complicated so stop pushing labels on others. Hell, there’s even a whole ass label for heterosexuals with exceptions.

Goog god, get over yourself and stop gatekeeping like no tomorrow.

Quite literally a bisexual. I understand that not everyone is bisexual just because there’s a singular person outside of their normal attractions. I also understand that not everyone will use the label bisexual, which you seem to struggle with. 

You’re the one forcing labels on people and being phobic. I’m done with this discussion as you clearly have no interest in changing your gatekeeping or understanding what “sexuality is a spectrum” truly means. At this point if you continue, I’m just gonna report and block you."	128q8ft	trans	797	0.98	2023-04-01 15:51:23
No, Trans Women Do NOT Have an Advantage Over Other Women, Caitlyn Jenner!	"Sorry if this is a rant, everyone, but what truly pisses me off is how the media loves to talk down on the transgender community. Like for what? It's mostly the same recycled crap that was fed to gay people. I'll be glad when we get the recognition we deserve too, because I feel like it divides the LGBT community. If I simply type in ""transgender,"" I see nothing but article after article attacking some woman who was just achieving her dreams. Seriously, she's not hurting anyone and is most likely on estrogen. She's my age. I'm not sure how long Lia's been on E, but I've been on T for over 3 years. 3 years! If she's transitioned as long as I have, there is no way she has a disadvantage over other women. HRT alters muscle and bones if you start early enough. I know because it changed my body permanently, and my upper body is waaaaayyyy stronger now. Trans women shouldn't be berated over who they are just because they won a championship. Seriously, I don't get it. Media fabricates it to look like she's just intruding, misgendering her, like trans women don't deserve a role model, or like cisgender women always lose. 

The fact that Caitlyn Jenner is so willing to advocate against transgender women havung the freedom to do what she couldn't do just isn't fair and selfish to me. There are many of us on the fence, who would love to be on a team as who we truly are, but are discouraged by this. IT's obvious and appalling that she's working for terfs and right-wing liberals who hate transgender people for any accomplishment they have, especially transgender women—just to give herself a pedestal. If she truly believes the crap she spews, that trans women are in it to ""destroy women"" and need to be grouped with the male division, maybe she should just speak for *herself*. How can a trans woman be so naive about her own identity? Not to mention all of the other things out there about her seemingly misgendering herself to a blind transphobic eye and announcing that she allows her kids to, calling her ""dad,"" so some terf will expect every trans person to want the same. 

Psssh. Me personally, my kids won't even be allowed to call me ""Mr. Mom"" let alone ""mom."" Some of us take our identity and lives more seriously, taking precaution when sharing so much stuff that can be misconstrued by the transphobic media that she gladly shares with. Cis people don't get that she does not speak for every trans person, but really just herself. I get she's non-dysphoric, and that is fine, but why publically announce these things if you're so in touch with people's OPINIONS on trans people? She's the reason why there's so many terf novels, and people refusing to understand or take us seriously. She's a true ""transtrender,"" since she's also sadly the most known trans individual for her reputation. It's a shame *she's* taking advantage of who she is, clowning herself to hold us back — when she doesn't realize terfs hate her too, whether she sides with them or not. She should cut that out. Someone her age should know better than to bully so many young women and out of jealousy since she had to compete with men. Some ""trans mom."" SMFH"	"As a trans woman who is also a competition fighter this gets brought up all the time by even organisers, I represent our clubs mixed team so I fight in the mixed gender category so its not an issue luckily, however at our last tournament the organisers came over and told the team that if I wanted to fight in the women's category I would have to fight in the weight class above my own cause of my biological advantage so its fair, I am at the bottom of my current weight class as the lightest fighter in that class for them mixed in the whole tournament. When on of my female team mates asked if she could fight in the male fights for the weight class below hers as that should be the same they told her she couldn't cause it would be dangerous to have people from different weight classes fighting. Anyway I got second in the mixed category after getting my head kicked in by this incredibly talented woman. So my ""advantage"" didn't help me there.
Yep in terms of sports, the science/data backs you up, at least for trans people that have been on HRT/Hormones for certain amount of years. If anyone says that trans women/men have any advantage in sports then they are quite literally denying science and data.

In other aspects of life nah, Trans people do not have any sort of advantage and anyone who says so is just a transphobe
Caitlyn Jenner has advantages over other women.

She’s cartoonishly rich.
Sports is just the go-to weapon of choice for transphobes right now. A lot of people are passionate about sports and trans women beating cis women in sports might seem more believable to the uneducated than trans people being pedohiles or invading bathrooms to assault people.
It’s very frustrating, science doesn’t seem to matter at all nor be desired on this topic.
Have you seen this post? https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/seoodq/at_the_risk_of_getting_hate_responses_but_the_lia/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

OP of it is basically being a transphobe and disagreeing with science, its sad to read through the post and some of the comments. How people can deny science and think they're being a good ally to trans people is beyond me.

Trans people do not have any sort of advantage at all over cis people in and out of sports
Too many people take sports more seriously than human rights.
I'm 100% with you on the issue of sports - transgender women should compete in woman's sports. All the data and science backs that up. I also agree how incredibly frustrating it is that Caitlyn Jenner, to a lot of people, is seen as the main ""voice of trans woman"" - I'm absolutely not a fan of hers and her views that she proudly shares with the world are deeply problematic for trans people.

I did want to talk about her kids calling her ""dad"" and that general concept. I'm a binary trans woman whose son calls her ""daddy"". I started my transition after he could talk and already was referring to me as daddy and I didn't want to give that name up. We tried some different ones and nothing felt right; I realized I was trying to force another name just to match typical gender norms and so I said ""screw it"". The way he excitedly exclaims ""Daddy!"" just melts my heart, I clearly formed a strong emotional connection to the name my son calls me. I tear up at the thought of giving that up and I don't feel like I'm taking my identity or my life less seriously because of that.

Now of course it's completely valid for trans people to feel uncomfortable being referred to as their AGAB's typical parent name and want to go with the one that matches their actual gender (in my case that would be going with ""mom"" or ""mommy""). I am very strict with everyone else in my life about using correct pronouns (she/her) and my chosen feminine name. What I'm trying to say is it is all valid. I would be cautious of starting down the road of referring to certain trans people as less serious about their gender identity and less valid for simply not conforming to the restrictive gender norms society expects.
Yes thank you for writing that. I'm endlessly annoyed seeing people that don't understand anything about the science and biology around trans people try to argue about this. It's almost always bad faith arguments that come from purposeful ignorance and bigotry. It also comes from defining and seeing trans women as ""biological males"" which in most people's minds means biologically the exact same as cis men.

If someone was truly arguing about it in good faith and evidence based science then we could actually make sure things are fair, safe, inclusive and equal. Based on the science it is fair for little kids that are prepuberty to play and compete against each other regardless of gender. Then once puberty starts it is acknowledged that people with CAIS (biologically male but androgen insensitive) can fairly compete against women. So there should not be any argument against teens on puberty blockers and hormones competing as their gender. If someone cannot accept even this, which is completely fair biologically and well understood then the problem is not about biological advantages and unfairness and it's about transphobia only.

There is some uncertainty about the performance of trans people that went through their first puberty before transitioning and how that compares to the difference between cis men and cis women. There is a massive lack of scientific research here and that's what's being exploited by transphobes. There's a lot to say about the current research and it does look in favor of trans people competing fairly but there is still not much data. If there are provable and demonstrable unfair advantages or disadvantages that go beyond what performance enhancing polymorphisms provide then maybe we could look into how to help trans athletes compete fairly by researching the differences between trans and cis performance and what can be done about it.
Every time someone pulls the 'trans women have an advantage in sports because of tEsToStErOnE' card all I can think of is how the last few times I've gotten bloodwork done my testosterone levels have been lower than those of an average cis woman because of HRT.
Scientific evidence has shown that if anything, transitioning actually gives trans women a disadvantage. I don't know whether that's true from a biological perspective but collected data reports that the vast majority of trans women that compete in sports come in the middle of the pack. If this narrative were true we'd be regularly dominating the women's sports scene. We're not. The trans women that do rank in first or near it work damn hard to get there.
Caitlyn Jenner really needs to get her head out of her ass.  She may have an advantage over others because she’s super fucking wealthy.  Not your average trans woman who might face much more hardships and disadvantages compared to cis people.  People like her do not make it better or easier for trans people to gain more tolerance and acceptance.
Caitlyn Jenner does NOT represent the entire transgender community. She doesn’t even represent all transgender women. She and many cisgender people only think she does, but in reality Caitlyn Jenner only represents herself.
I think the current NCAA qualification rules are a fair solution that should be a model to follow in schools. At least 1 year continuous on HRT (and remaining on HRT) for athletic eligibility. At that point natural advantages are mostly reversed.  I see it as a good compromise between fairness and inclusitivity.
I avoid being taken in by anti trans athlete arguments because I honestly know little about sports or athletics. Like, anti-trans people expect us to be experts in everything. To answer all their questions, I would need a deep knowledge of sports history, biology, sociology. And I don't really think facts would change their mind because transphobes aren't gonna be asking any of this in good faith. 

Instead of playing their game, I would ask transphobes why they suddenly give a damn about women's sports. Where were they when women were being paid pennies on the dollar compared to their male counterparts? Where were they when coaches faced repeated sexual assault and rape claims? And most importantly, where is their evidence that transgender women are dominating in sports? 

The nonsensical arguments of talking heads is ultimately just hot air. I would try not to get worked up over it
I agree with you. They should be treated equally. Just because trans women want to be who they want, doesn't mean others should judge them for it
Reasons why I don't reveal my trans status to any of the physical activities I participate in. People crap on Lia now they crapped on Fallon Fox, Chloe Jonnson had to sue crossfit to compete because they disqualified her for being trans. Like it's a nightmare and in it were told we can't participate in sports, we are told we shouldn't participate in fashion after the outrage for Valentina Sampaio becoming a VS model.

Like no one wants us anywhere and it's sad.
""It's a shame she's taking advantage of who she is, clowning herself to hold us back"". good word choice.
Reminder that Caitlyn Jenner transitioned when she did to avoid being charged with vehicular manslaughter. That said, she's just an awful mouthpiece for cishets and the right wing to use however they desire, they know she doesn't give a shit about the queer community and will happily generalize every trans person's experience to her disconnected richest 1% daydream.
This is why I wouldn’t want to be any kind of famous or well-known, being trans. There’s just too much stigma. 

And I think “society” will always be transphobic, unfortunately. I think it only gets worse from here as the cis-het conservative backlash moves on. We’re their new bogeyman, the way gay people were in the 90s and atheists were in the 00s.
I have nothing positive to say about Caitlin and hate that she has somehow become a person that represents the trans community because she is rich and I'm a firm believer in allowing athletes to compete as their gender but I completely disagree with you on allowing her kids to call her dad.  I transitioned later when my youngest was 15 and the oldest 24.  I am and always will be their dad and I am proud for them to refer to me as dad.  I also realize that not everyone would feel the same way and would want to be called something else and if that is what you want then that is perfectly fine and you should do what feels right to you but don't start criticizing other with a different take as it easily comes off as we are not ""trans enough"" unless we conform to your ideals.
It's intersectional. All else being equal Cis men have advantage over cis women but cis women have advantage over trans women. Because trans women may (MAY) spend time as presenting as a cis man, it becomes intersectional.

Caitlyn is such a cunt.  Can someone please take her crown?
Goofy.

HRT can add, but it cannot take away.  It can give you boobs, but it can’t take away your boobs.  It can give you strength, but it can’t take away your strength.

Your experience taking testosterone is not the same as a male’s experience taking estrogen.
I'm a trans woman and grad student and regularly do women's intramural sports as something to do just so I'm active and not completely socially isolated doing dissertation research all the time.

I absolutely \*suck\* at said women's sports. I actually \*like\* basketball, but even then, last time I played in the women's basketball tournament, my team lost in the first round 15-2.

And then there was me playing women's volleyball when I couldn't hit the ball over the net the entire game.... and the fact that my 5k run times are actually in the low average range for \*women\* in my age bracket...

I do these sports because I like doing it and being physically active, but if you watch me perform it's damn obvious that I am not \*remotely\* at an advantage to other girls and am low average at best. It's clear that the people saying they think trans women have an advantage have never actually seen a trans woman perform athletically.
[deleted]
Actually there's a bit of nuance here. Those who took puberty blockers and hrt see no significant benifit. Unathletic trans women who became athletic after transition likewise saw no significant benifit.

The only group that showed any advantage were high-performing athletes, and even then it was only for specific events. Namely, events to focused on strength such as lifting. Swimming, running, and technique based sports saw no significant advantage.

And even where there was an advantage, such as with power lifting, there was a noticeable loss in said advantage over time. So basically trans women DO have an advantage, but only in a vanishingly small number of events, only when they were near professional athlete level pre-transition, only when they never stop training after transition, and seemingly only for a temporary amount of time.

Edit: I want to make something clear: I'm steelmanning the opposing arguement. There's very little research into this topic and what little does exist is lacking in a lot of ways. Once you weed out the terrible studies (ill elaborate down below), what little does exist finds no advantage outside of a few studies that specifically looked at high level athletes who transitioned. 

In generally, mildly or non-athletic folks who transition will see no advantage besides maybe height. I didn't see much good evidence asserting blood oxygen levels are higher in trans athletes, which is a common right wing talking point. I also didn't see evidence that trans women have an advantage in sports of endurance or technique. There is evidence that trans women have a disadvantage in swimming, though again there's not much research.

As for the study i referenced, the researcher measured thigh circumference and made the assumption that sush a measurement is correlative to overall strength. On top of small sample sizes, she failed to isolate a bunch of variables such as height, body fat composition, weight, and more. That's all on top of the fact that said researcher in question was a TERF

shit I was in a women's basketball tournament in December as a trans woman.... our team lost 15-2 in the first round and I fell flat on my back halfway through the match. And that's not counting the women's volleyball game where I couldn't hit the ball over the net. Some advantage I have lol...

Also I've been a distance runner since high school and my run times have \*dropped\* like 10 minutes on HRT, and are now in the low average range for \*women\* in my age bracket.

Been on HRT for almost 4 years.

What about Lia Thomas whose swim times literally blow cis women's olympic winning times to pieces? This conversation is not cut and dry.
There is no advantage, hence why we are constantly seeing biological women competing in mens leagues, oh wait….
Hot take: rich people aren't people and what they think doesn't matter.
[deleted]
i guess they'll keep changing the story to fit their narrative
which is so stupid too because if you've ever seen trans women compete in women's sports you'd see how silly the idea of a ""biological advantage"" is. 

Like... if we had so much of an advantage, how come I can't hit the ball over the net in women's volleyball? And how come my basketball team got knocked out of the women's basketball tournament last month in the first round with a 15-2 loss?  And how come my 5k run times are low average for women in my age bracket?

Its Because for the conservative it's not really about science, sports or fairness, it's about hate, it's about marginalizing us. They never cared about women's sports and they still don't, it's just a useful tool at this moment
right, and they say *we* ignore science
Calling Ben Shapiro anything but by his name has to be one of my favorite running jokes. I like calling him bep shapeepo
that guy is seriously brainwashed
>Trans people do not have any sort of advantage at all over cis people in and out of sports

Source: trust me bro
It's so dumb... I actually \*like\* sports... but I like \*playing\* them, and love the social bonding experience and keeping fit. That's all I'm in it for. 

I really don't understand the obsession with competition that so many people have surrounding it, like their entire self worth and identity is riding on winning.
Yeah, but she's telling terfs/transphobic media outlets something that is personal, that can easily be misconstrued out of proportion to the point where they believe we all would feel this way, or that feeling this way means gives them a right to misgender us. It's different if she shared that in a transfriendly forum like you did. She shouldn't tell people who could care less about us about her life like that. 

The problem is her hypocrisy though; it just doesn't make herself look bright doing what she's doing.

It fuels the transphobia we face, and cis people who can't even wrap their heads around why someone would need to transition just won't get it. They can't even get something as self-defining as gender dysphoria. All of her actions now tell me that maybe she feels insecure about herself. Even if she's projecting hate towards other trans women, it speaks volumes for how she must feel about herself, being unable to emphathize with transgender people to the degree that she is for cis people who are unoppressed (unless racially, culturally or religously). I don't think I've ever seen her come up and say something that advocates for us, shutting down the hate we receive rather than to turn a blind eye to it. I'm glad she didn't become governor, and fear if she did. I would hate to see her try and take away medical access — knowing her, she probably would support anything that is against us and our wellbeing
very lesbian of you to be a woman who likes being called daddy
Didn't the NCAA change that a couple days ago? Basically abdicated the responsibility and threw it to individual sport's ruling bodies?
Exactly! If trans people and youths were given rights and equality, and were made to be safe in their family and homes then many trans youths wouldnt have gone through the wrong puberty.

Many trans youth have to live in hiding until they can move out of their family home because they are in an unsafe family and cant speak out or get medical help for their transitioning and identity until well after puberty.

I had to go through the male puberty despite knowing i was trans since I was a young child, and i couldnt speak up about myself because I was in a very religious family, that i often got physically and verbally abused in. So i stayed quiet until i was in a more supportive and safe environment. I had no other option but to go through the wrong puberty
Nope, just the transphobes and terfs don't. Let's not scatter and allow them to decimate our representation. Gay people dealt with the same thing until people realized gay people weren't going anywhere because it was never a choice. Same for us. Sadly, terfs will probably try to discourage us for another decade or two, since it was only the late 90's when clinical trials became available. That's why that stupid crossdresser stereotype is out there, cementing the hard past that the trans generations that came before us endured before HRT..
Caitlyn Jenner is a TRANSGENDER TERF. That's clowning herself, since I never knew you could be BOTH transgender and a terf. I can't see how she can give a greenlight to gatekeep trans women from competing where they belong, and invalidating like that WHILE telling her that it is ""good for her to be playing as her authentic self."" Seriously contradicting herself, and she is a seen as the one transgender with a voice out of all of us, just because of her children's careers. I mean who doesn't know the Kardashians.

If she was cis, she's just be a terf. There is undeniable internalized transphobia going on even if she is just allowing transphobic people to use her as a commanding voice for them. Idk how she's just taking charge of women's leagues. I get she is a retired Olympic gold medalist, but she shouldn't take advantage of an opportunity to do something right for her community for a change rather than trying to speak for all of us in a negative light. She should either defend this girl who is *50 years younger than her*, old enough to be her grand child, or decline to comment since they're probably not going to listen to her if she says something to validate us. 

I'm just imagining myself as Lia or any other trans woman who is excluded based off of a stereotype that has NO EVIDENCE to back it up, stringing this rumor along like she could care less. That's fucked up. If that isn't clowning around, idk what is. She calls herself an advocate for the transgender community, when she is a transgender terf, pushing the very transphobic rhetoric that is getting especially trans women killed. 

If she's not in it for the money terfs will pay her so that her reputation among the transgender community is destroyed, and greenlighting conversion therapy to scare particularly women and girls who are trans from following their dreams, then what is she doing? Why would she want people of this generation to live like the people in the 70s-90s (when she was forced to compete with men) to go through what she did? That was conversion therapy if you really think about it since clinical trials for HRT to help trans people (when it was around for 60 years) only become available for us about 25 years ago, so that's how the ""crossdressing"" confusion came about since we were gatekept. I would HATE for things to go  back to that, but I guess she's envious of the new opportunities this generation of trans people have. I'm a bit envious of those who got peri instead of DI and hormonal blockers to skip that first puberty, but you don't see me advocating to gatekeep
that is true. i think the only reason why she's the mouthpiece is because it's like she's following a transphobic script based off of stereotypes
... transitioning doesn't improve your odds in the justice system, ever. Being rich enough to afford great lawyers does. She's bad enough without making stuff up
I'm sorry. I updated the sentence.
seriously. Why do people associate her with being a spokesperson for the trans community? Literally the entire community hates her ass, and there's so many other prominent trans figures you \*could\* be using instead, like Rachel Levine, Sarah McBride, Nicole Maines, or Laverne Cox.
Man I went from being able to lift over 100 pounds+ easy to having issues with 50+. Also sports are literally about who's genetically better in the first place but no one admits it. Basketball? Be tall... cycling? Endurance... hell Michael Phelps has double jointed ankles which give him better kicking range so get this ""born genetically different"" out of here if you won't call out all of it. Cause it just sounds like whining.
regularly**
**FYI being trans is more than feelings, I already know I'm a whole ass dude if you ignore this post like most who hate the truth do. also, believing everything Caitlyn says for all trans people is naive. With her logic, I'd go to jail for trespassing on women's sports since I have normal male Testosterone levels and am larger than most of the dudes in my family, towering at 6'2 (5 inches taller than my pops) As long as I take my weekly stomach shots, work out and eat right, I will always have the advantage Lia is accused of having with baseless claims made by people who don't know her and are exploiting her for money**

I clearly stated in the first paragraph that HRT alters bones and muscle if you start early enough. I didn't have significant bone changes from the first puberty at all. If you counter in science, the bones don't reach the peak mass until the age of 30, declining within every decade to follow. Lia is 22, and likely is on estrogen, and has been for a while (don't know her personally). This will be just a guess. Everyone's body is different. 

The argument *is* scientific because it's not an opinion, not guesses like those made about Lia without even seeing her play or looking at her league's stats. 

I'll use myself as an example since I'm the same age as her and transgender as well. 

I started T at the age of 18, shortly before my 19th birthday. Despite trying to adapt to the lifestyle of a cis woman, I've always been clocked as a man, so estrogen's effect on me was subtle. Just before I started T, I noticed the hip bones begin to widen, after gathering so much fat that I was unaware that it wasn't. Jumbo thighs and huge butts run in my family, for both the men and the women. The only thing estrogen really did was inhibit my ability to lose the weight in my lower body and gain upper body weight. 

My facial structure and bones are something I'm happy about since it's apparent just how the testosterone my body produced had the upper hand when it came to these characteristic gems. Even my height is around the 90th male percentile, because starting T resumed the growth presumed to of been stunted from the age of 14 up until 19. I grow around 0.15-0.5cm a month on average, so subtly it tastes months to notice. I'm someone who revolves my diet and my supplemental intake on my transition, not just take testosterone. I do this because I am not on E-blockers and haven't had an easy way of accessing it, like many transgender individuals. Due to my genetic makeup: inherited growth spurts, delayed puberty (i noticed it all began when I was 8, with breast development, but noticed stuff still happening 10 years later) Luckily, the women on my mom's side particularly have higher T levels than average, and can grow small beards or facial hair in general; this was a genetic lottery for me, since pretty much all the guys in my immediate family have facial hair that connects.

T squared out my jaw. I'd be more than happy to share pictures comparing my facial changes. Some are muscle, some are bone. I had an alien-like, long egg head before, with a skinny pixie chin. Now my face is wide and boxy. Rather than recede like I naturally appeared to without T's influence, my hairline grew IN, back to the original strong widow's peak that I was born with.

I take stem cells and do clay masks regarly, so I notice evolution to a higher degree. The general life of the cells in your body is 7 years, sometimes up to 10. This is usually around the time (6-12 yrs) when trans people feel the most content. Their changes depend heavily on the receptors in the body, responsible for regulating the body's individual response.

I am a body builder so my cells are always rejuvenating. Estrogenized cells that may be still present 3 years in, given the lifespan of cells, are killed and replaced by cells that responded more heavily to testosterone before and after HRT.

This doesn't mean that testosterone is stronger or better, just that my own genetic makeup responded more to it. 

Estrogen and female are seen as the default settings in development, so the face, arms, feet and voice don't grow or develop nearly as much — and will remain almost prepubescent-like only if the estrogenic receptors are weaker. Testosterone has a heavy influence on bones, not just estrogen. We can't forget, estrogen does too. Trans women who start soon enough may notice permanent hip changes, and a ceize in the widening of the shoulders and back.

That being said, if Lia is just as far as me in this, she does not have an advantage. Caitlyn Jenner is either full of sh*t, or she really wants the world to go back to pretending that trnsgender people is a 20th century phdnomenon that cannot be debunked in anyway with facts and science. Do your own research before you decide to have a debate. I gave my facts, and you have to give yours if you are worthy of a response from me, or I take it you have none because such an article contradicting doctors and science do not exist. 

Why should men join women's leagues and not women? I'm a real man, who needs testosterone to have a normal day to day life, or else something would be missing from my life that a man shouldn't be robbed of. I will never go off of T or fulfill the dreams of hypocrite, uneduacated terfs or be indoctrinated into the puppetry Caitlyn Jenner is in, to fill the needs of other people's lives just because *they're insecure that I exist.*

Instead, I'll keep existing along with different species of transgender animals out there. God even made transgender people who can develop a penis at the age of 12. Mine is developing much later, despite the micro dimensions it retains so far, I'd rather it than a vagina. I can jerk it, unsheathe it, and penetrate — before going under any knife (sorry if TMI) but men can't help but value our penises like women value their breasts. A phallus is homologous, meaning shared among almost every living thing of any gender preference, so saying someone is dickless like many of you presumably transphobic or naive people do is way more unscientific sounding to me. Women just don't want to call it a penis and estrogen keeps the development of the penis in people who are AFAB in limbo just to keep your precious heterosexuality alive. That doesn't mean that facts care about your feelings over mine. 

**FYI being trans is more than feelings, I already know I'm a whole ass dude if you decide to ignore this like most who hate the truth do. also, believing everything Caitlyn says for all trans people is naive. If you're a dude who's heterosexual, it's kinda gay to think we could end up in the bed together over the ambiguity of genetalia of chromosomes alone, and that you'd kiss my hairy face and stroke my swollen 100% masculinized muscles, don't you think?**
This is definitely something I have thought about. People's perception of sports is skewed by only watching elite athletes where every little advantage helps. They don't consider that most people (who play for fun or compete at amateur level) have only average talent/athleticism in sports and half of people are worse than that.



THEN consider that a lot of trans people (not all, of course) would shy away from sports as a kid because of their dysphoria or social reasons, but might be willing to try post transition/later in life. Not that late starters can't be talented or anything, but obviously people who train from childhood have an advantage.
I mean this is like saying all black people are better athletes.  Strength and height are only one equation into being a great athlete, however there is a reason why there are sayings like, you can't teach height.    


I don't understand why Lia Thomas whether she is Ledecky good or just good for her weak division matters. From my perspective I think people want to make this a trans right issue but from my small mind I see the division the same reason we have men and women's sports. Again people will constantly point out how Thomas would be considered a high school star but no where near Olympic level, thus poses no real danger to cis women's sports, but that not the issue since in men's baseball not everyone who takes steroids automatically becomes Mark McGuire or Sammy Sosa and hits 70 homeruns a season, just like not ever trans athlete will come close to Ledecky, but the point is Thomas in my eyes has a pure edge since since was able to cultivate a men's body for the majority of her life and only recently transitioned. It be one thing if while transitioning she loss most of her mass and shrunk 3"" but as she stands she is 6'1"" and 210lbs of muscle.
The kicker is that's not the trans person's fault, either. If society would get the fuck over itself, trans women wouldn't have had to go through the wrong puberty in the first place.
As a sort of side question branching off this: Since a person’s body is undergoing changes, particularly those early dates, is exercise or competition potentially more dangerous?
Its small and not always true, several studies have been done that have been peer reviewed and upheld have been able to show that there is no significant link between trans people and having an advantage against their cis counter part, and most transgender people had a negative experience with sports due.

So again, the difference/advantage seems to be insignificant for the majority of trans folk. 

A lot of the studies that have tried to come out showing that there is, have been pretty much all discredited and proven wrong due to various reasons. People have tried and failed at finding any significant or major advantage.
>The only group that showed any advantage were high-performing athletes, and even then it was only for specific events. Namely, events to focused on strength such as lifting. Swimming, running, and technique based sports saw no significant advantage.

Quick question: can you please link me to the study/studies with these findings?  In researching this topic, I'm only locating sources that claim the opposite. Thank you!
Wouldn't there be a lingering advantage in events where height is helpful? For those women who transition later of course. Basketball, volleyball, high jump etc.
This argument is total bs. The fact that you are not a competent athlete doesn't mean that all the scientific date is invalid.
Heres one of the many studies that have disproven the lie that trans people have advantages in sports, when they dont. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357259/

But also do you're own research lmao, the burden of proof isnt on me, it's transphobes like OP and those who agree to disprove what I and science have claimed.

And just look up the many video essayists, and left leaning people on YouTube that fight for trans peoples rights lmao, many of them have made videos going over the research, and studies that have been done as well as debating transphobes over it as well.

I love how whenever transphobes say anything they always make the other person do the research for them, regardless of if they are right or wrong, transphobes and their supporters always do the minimal amount of research before saying their dumb shit
No, her swim times are record-setting **for her school**, which is far from the best in the sport. 

she's nowhere near the women's swimming version of Michael Phelps. And she did quite well pretransition relative to men.

God, I wish trans women were all Wonder Woman. That would be awesome. Unfortunately it's not the case.
She doesn't though.. She was beaten recently by 3 cis women and a pre-transition trans man.  


https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/01/10/lia-thomas-university-pennsylvania-iszac-henig-yale-trans/
dan, do your research, dude. don't be a follower of fake news. lia's swim teammates who want to exclude her from the team, and blame her identity the moment she wins a medal are transphobic.
Yes it is, lmao anyone saying differently is just simply transphobic, when science overwhelmingly agrees that trans people have no athletic advantage over their cis counter parts.

Pretty much every single study that has come out against trans people in sports has been debunked and discredited.

Whereas pretty much every study thats for trans people in sports and proves that there is no advantage has pretty much been shown and upheld their findings.

So again, love how transphobes like you try to deny science whenever it doesnt back you up, but the moment you think science does you dont. Always funny how transphobes will turn their back to science whenever it doesnt agree, but any moment science does support something you say, you hold it near and dear as if you've ""always"" believed in science
No, we hate her because she’s a shitty person
No, it’s not her money, it’s the fact that she’s a massive hypocrite. I was merely poking fun at her hypocrisy and using her words against her.
She also killed someone and got off scott free because of a lack of evidence to convict her on manslaughter.
Right back at ya
🤣🤣🤣🤣 here, you naive baby. convinced this is Caitlyn now

The rest seem to be stupid journalists, or news trying to keep up with the trend withour actually doing an investigation because they aren't biology experts, nor do they specialize in HRT, psychology, or bloodwork of any kind of labwork NOR do they have a statistic of the truth of trans women since like you, many just go by opinion to quickly get their story out there when expected. It's kind of like working on radio. If you're unsure, you'd hate to admit.

Federal law is against discrimination in workplace/school settings against sex and gender identity, so this will never be an abroad thing - EVER LOL, unless Trump returned.

There it is folx, from the *experts*!!!

Fuck your feelings, buddy. If you want to fight for women's equality, WTF are you waiting for now?


Because this is the stupicy you're fighting for, men and women competing, downright contradicting yourself. Women would not feel protected at all with men who will never detransition like me. I'm so obviously male that month 2 on T, I started getting horrified looks when I went into women's restrooms. One picked up her daughter and left as soon as she came in and saw me, so I've used public men's rooms no problem ever since, even while it's packed. If this happened in CA, I'd join a sport just to screw with this unscientific transphobic craze (since conversion therapy is proven to be ineffective) and I have no reason to want to be off of Testosterone > https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/golf-archives/2022/01/25/luc-esquivel-trans-sports-ban-boys-and-mens-teams-daily-cover
For the conservatives, yes. I'm talking more broadly than that, because this issue in particular splits our allies, who listen to science about other things like Climate. (people who are allies on other trans issues)
It's pretty irrelevant tho. If science says that trans women have an unfair advantage, then that's it. Why bring politics into this?
Literally the same! 😂 Sben shporkbo, his transphobic ass has so many hilarious names and i love the meme. Ben Shaboobo
Ikr! I could just see their YouTube search history in my mind... ben Shabeebo, blaire white and other transphobes.

The thing that really showed me they were being bad faith was that anytime science was brought up they would blindly turn an eye to it and ignore anything to do with science, because they full on knew that science proved them wrong so they didnt want to acknowledge those comments.

And whenever called out for being transphobic they'd just turn around and act like a victim.. like at one point they tried to act victimized by saying ""well you havent been sexually assault and dealt with transphobes like i have"" 

Yet i had to go over the SA i've been through, and that i've dealt with transphobes IRL and one of them was even an ex who almost took my life over my trans based identity.

I just dont get how someone like him can be so transphobic but then turn around and say ""nuh uh! Im trans myself therefor Its impossible for me to be transphobic"" like.. have they never heard about ""self hating trans people"" such as Blaire White.

Like... How can you be so misled by the lies spread by transphobes to go into a trans community and be blatantly transphobic and make yourself out to be the victim by saying ""boo hoo ya'll are a hive mind and attacking me for being transphobic when im trans""
No, its called look things up for yourself? There are plenty of studies that have come out that have proven and shown that trans people do not have any significant advantage over their cis counter parts.

The funny thing is pretty much every study that has come out saying that ""they do have a significant advantage"" has been discredited and disproven.

I love when transphobes and people like you expect the other person to provide you with all the evidence and proof, but you're side never has to show any evidence or proof. 

Its almost like ya'll transphobes deny science when it doesnt benefit you, but will take the side of science if it does benefit you 🤔 weird how that happens isnt it, ya',ll never have to show any proof for your claims yet you expect the other side to show proof of their claims.

You're the one who has to show the burden of proof, since you're the ones trying to refute the claim that science overwhelmingly agrees with
trust me bro is not a source🤣🤣🤣
Totally - context is important! And there's a way to responsibly share details like the above. For instance, if I somehow ended up with a big platform and what my kids call me comes up I'd be honest but explain why and end with a ""Keep in mind though not every trans person will be comfortable with it like I am. Make sure you check and respect what each person wants!"" And I doubt she did that - I'm really not trying to defend Caitlyn Jenner. 

Just addressing the notion that trans women whose kids call them ""dad""(or vice versa with trans men) or do other gender non-conforming things are taking this all less seriously and are hurting trans people. 

If 'society' see's a trans woman whose kids call her ""dad"" and runs with it saying ""See! Even they see themselves as men!"" that's societies problem and ignorance. Not the trans woman who's just living her life and doing what's comfortable. She shouldn't have to cover up details like that and conform to society's gender norms for the sake of having cis people take us seriously.
she's talking about her kids
Exactly. Like the antiwork Fox interview in a lot of ways, she's cherry picked to be a scapegoat, to selectively define a movement to an audience. AND to confirm the right's ""truths"" without being accused of speaking over the movement.

When you're a celebrity, a big ""scandal"" about your private life, like transitioning, can draw media attention away from you being a shitty human being and help you dodge the consequences.

Edit: also when you have that much money and clout you could absolutely say you're going through something difficult and life-changing to avoid prison time. Doesn't work if you're poor though.
Thank you!  I understand your preference is different than mine and tbh if I had transitioned when I was younger I would probably be more in line with your preference.  I'm just at a different point now with different perspective and we need to realize that both of our views are valid for us and all the other perspectives that others have are also valid.
She transitioned started E in 1986. She was among the first famous trans people to do it, and kept it under the radar for 30 years
That, but I also think cis people are presuming trans women are bio identical to cis guys and we just...arent. 

So many cis people don't even know that HRT is a thing, let alone what it does to you.
It's not that simple though. Children shouldn't make life changing decisions at that age.
I'm not an athlete by any stretch but I would do some fitness activities from time to time. I remember that I nearly passed out from trying to keep up with my coworkers about six months into HRT. I used to be about as or more fit than them, and never had problems managing energy before that.
Not aware of any science on this, but kids still play sports during puberty, so if it's more dangerous, it might only be marginally so, perhaps with a few specific pains, but probably no major counter-indication.
 I'll tell you during the next few months/years though :P (competitive badminton player here)
let's ban tall cis women too. The tallest cis woman on record was 7'7 (lol what a man! Sports cheater!) which seems pretty OP to me.
[deleted]
Except that the scientific data *does* point to trans women not having an advantage.

You lose any male athletic advantage when you lose testosterone.

It's anti science to pretend otherwise.

Also ask yourself why is it that the only trans women to even *qualify*  for the Olympics...placed last in their events? How would that be possible if there were such a huge advantage ? 

Hint: it's because we don't actually have one.
""Transphobes like OP"" What? Who said I was transphobic? That's a first 🤦‍♂️
All of the journalists on this story should be fired/sued for harassment and defamation, even if she wasn't a celeb.

I hope Lia is doing alright.

because… the science doesn’t…
Ben Shabooboo🤣🤣🤣
omg you are so right. it wouldn't surprise me if Ben Shapiro trolls this place. He refused to look at the facts I provided, and shyed away from any opportunity to explain how any of his claims were logical. ""it just is because i want it to be"" and explaining why cis people are cis isn't plausible enough for me. Caitlyn Jenner and Blair White like most terfs/trabsphobes are puppets, who feel insecure in some way about themselves about the existence of trans people and everyone else's stance. you'd expect cis people who know nothing to just stay out of the mix, but what surprises me more is when trans people betray their own.

Like how can they want this shit to continue happening to us, and bail on us the moment that they doubt themselves? I guess it's to appeal to the terfs/transphobes who aren't gonna change for us just like we aren't for them. Sometimes i wonder if they even are trans to think being transphobic is in anyway productive. To me, it just makes things worse — making us look bad. I think the only reason why Caitlyn Jenner is as popular as she is for making us look like deceivers. I don't want to say it's bad enough she transitioned at the age of around 65, after ""knowing for decades,"" but that doesn't help her look any better doing this crap.
""transphobes like me""!? how fucking DARE you!? you don't know what my views are, stop insulting people that go against your opinions!?
exactly what I'm saying.
i didn't mean it in that context lmao, just pointing out that that's what a butch lesbian might do
well, she should probably start declining to comment. It's not like she's desperate for money, and this really isn't doing her reputation well. Due to her being so easily-puppeteered to speak such nonsense that goes against facts, she didn't get my vote as governor.
What precisely do you think I was saying in my comment?

As I was apparently unclear, let me clarify: 

1. Caitlyn Jenner didn't transition to dodge manslaughter charges. Being trans doesn't make prosecutors go easy on you. 

2. Yes, she's utterly and irresponsibly wrong about trans women's bodies. No, trans women don't have ""unfair advantages.""
... no, you get the charges dropped via your expensive lawyer finding a plausible pretext. :p ""I was trans the whole time"" is not a get out of jail free card, even if it might distract a tabloid or ten.
That's def true. When I was younger, like an actual child, I'm pretty sure I just thought it was surgery and that's it. I never thought.about hormones or heard anything about it until I was much older and seeking out that information specifically
And that's exactly what puberty blockers are for. Buy time to speak with qualified therapists before your body does something miserable and irreversible to you.
Kids can play sports but they should not be extraneously training (such as for Olympic levels) as it can negatively impact their natural growth
Well, it we take 5'5"" as average for AFAB and 5'9"" for AMAB. Lose two inches (more than average?) for HRT shortening. Then it's 2 inches of advantage on average. So it's 2 inches of ""advantage"" on average.

I don't think that's cause to exclude trans women at all. But let's be realistic about the facts.
[removed]
I think they meant the person asking for the data citation, no OP of this thread. I certainly didn't think you were being transphobic
She’s given hate by the trans community for being racist and transphobic, not for being trans
It’s not a “personal narrative,” it’s an actual thing that actually happened. She rear ended a car, pushing it into oncoming traffic and killing the driver, and the DA did not press charges against her. [Here’s](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-manslaughter-charge-caitlyn-jenner-20150820-story.html) an article from when the crash happened. Someone is dead, it’s her fault, and she faced no repercussions for it.
Did you see the comments where he basically said ""sure trans people are a minority but so are CIS people"" I about died from that. How can you say that cis people, the people who are actively working against us (not all but the broad group i mean) and whom we often fear.. are a fucking minority group, when cis people or rather cis white people dont have to live in fear of losing all their rights.

Also the fact that he tried to call me a ""gatekeeper"" yet also responded to me by saying ""we'll ive been trans longer then most of you, in fact i was trans before it was popular and ive got more karma then you "" like.. as if thats not an attempt at gatekeeping the conversation, also.. like no duh? My accounts only 2 days old lol so ofcourse you'll have more karma then me.

It might be mean to say this, but i doubt that he/the op of that post was even a legit trans person. Like I just dont believe that someone who is trans and has experienced the struggle that we go through... To willingly defend transphobic lies, and disinformation and try to make the trans communities the aggressors and cis people to be the victims... Thats just so.. anti trans that i dont think an actual trans person would do such a thing.

Like after so much science denial, and made up bullshit that one can spout before it becomes obvious they dont actually know what being trans is like. 

Someone even pointed out to them that hormones take a huge toll on a persons body, and explained to them that ""estrogen is just as powerful as testosterone"" because the OP said that of the two hormones estrogen is the weaker one.

Nobody will be able to convince me that he wasnt just a bad faith actor who came here to cause drama and be harm, like how anyone could look at that post and their comments and think they were in good faith is beyond me
The reason is simple. Rather than help us stop the trains to the death camps, they want to make sure they are the absolute last ones put on them. Fuck Jenner and those like her.
Lmao you're the one denyong science here, and sorry anyone who can deny the science of this subject is just a transphobe. Also you're the one going ""trust me bro"" which is a transphobic persons favorite thing to day when the left make claims about subjects regarding trans people
does women with PCOS have an advantage too? they can grow beards after all. your logic:😬
It actually really just depends on several evidence based factors. I didn't think I had to dumb it down for you.

Someone who is still T-dominant, whether male or female, has normal or high male hormonal levels, and completed puberty shouldn't compete with women and girls just like cis women on steroids can't. That's why it's laughable that so many ""wannabe experts"" overlook this detail: Testosterone is a steroid when preferring to put women against transgender MALES (female to male).

This is a fact any level-headed trans person like me cannot argue with. Vice versa for E-dominance and competing with men. 

That creates the advantage, so I guess we're not as dumb as previously just assumed. 

If society does what the terfs want, trans men will probably be not allowed to compete at all since many of us are even stronger than the cis men in our age division and trans women wouldn't be able to overpower the upper body strength of men. I'm explaining to you what I already did a hour ago. You ignored it because it was too long, scientific, and technical.

Lia looks like she is within her first 5 years of estrogen. Don't let the bone changes of T-poisoning confuse you. Her muscle mass looks female to me, compaired to my veiny, bulging ones. Her face looks soft and estrogenic too so I have no doubt she's on Estrogen.

If she's been on hormonal blockers since she was a  pre-teen, or has been on estrogen for years, again — NO proven advantages unless she has Eddie Hall's rare condition. He's the world's strongest man, whose muscles do not atrophy or have a stopping point, which his daughter also inherited — giving them hulk-like physiques with little effort due to the rare condition, causing what I described: myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy. That or steroids would be the only advantage against cisgender women, NOT estrogen you dunce. 🤣🤣🥵

I hope Eddie Hall's cisgender daughter isn't disqualified over her ""advantage""
Haha thank you for clarifying. I was 50/50 on which way you meant it and so decided to just not respond.

I'm not butch but in regards to the lesbian stereotype... if the Doc Martens fits 🤷‍♀️
my bad i thought you were taking up for Caitlyn
Delay puberty till you're 18 years old? Seems unlikely.
Yeah, I'm only speaking of competition at, say, regional level ? I was not speaking about people who specifically train to be world-class in their sport - sorry for the misunderstanding
[deleted]
""Tower over the girls"" LMAO!!! 

Dude..im 5'7"" and a trans woman, and not even the tallest woman on my basketball team.

Shit, I've had a cis woman teammate who is like twice my size. I'm a really *tiny* skinny little thing. Despite what you seem to think, we don't all look like she hulk, and it is more than possible for cis women to be bigger and taller than us.

Shit, Michelle Obama, Melania Trump, and Sigourney weaver are all 4 inches taller than me. They are all cis.

And yeah you actually *do* lose all male athletic ability. Shit, my boyfriend can pin me to the ground just by laying his foot on top of me, and I can't open jars anymore without help. 

And again, if there was such a magic 15% difference how is it possible that I am in the *lower* average for my run times for women in my age bracket? Shouldn't it be higher than that? 

And what records? Cite your sources here. Not a single trans woman has ever so much as medaled at the Olympics despite being eligible for 20 years now.

And YouTube propaganda videos are not a credible source imo.
I didn't. he deleted literally everything after refusing to read the facts we gave him, just like something ben shapiro would do.

i found pics of him ""pre."" Even ""pre"" dude looks like a cis guy to me who grew out a patchy beard for the past 8 years. it wouldn't surprise me if he is, since part of the post seemed like a massive slap in the face  of any real trans person. I'm surprised I haven't seen the guy troll r/ftm, if he's even heard of that sub.

he didn't care about the argument i had that supports him either, so if he's truly trans, this guy either has a screw loose or hates himself like the other trans transphobes. 

He couldn't even give me an unbiased, science based source that proves ""no matter how long"" we take HRT since it's been clinically proven.
First of all this conversation is finished, Secondly you misunderstood  completely the ""trust me bro"". I wasn't telling them to trust me, it was an ironic way of saying that the redditor I was answering had no proof of whatever he was trying to say.
I don't know, do PCOS women grow significantly taller than other women and have significantly more muscle mass? If so, yes they would have advantage. Your logic: ""I want to bend reality because I can't accept biology""
Nah, I'm a trans woman who transitioned a couple years before Caitlyn did, I hate her guts :p I was just pushing back on the idea that being trans is a way to get out of legal trouble
Sometimes puberty delays itself. Your unscientific beliefs probably ignore intersex people altogether, doesn't it? Often times, transgender people are. This could mean the chromosomes are indecisive, mixmatched, they exhibit deemed ""male"" and ""female"" genitals, or the brain fully developed as another gender. Delayed puberty is usually how people find out that they are intersex. More studies may find being trans begins as an intersexuality, since people assigned so at birth have to have the same types of procedures as transgender people, for the same cause — gender dysphoria and various gender identities. The only one who knows them best is God and themselves. Not you. Not some other trans person. Just God and them. People calling Lia a man is sickening for this reason, when she's well aware that she's a woman. Don't like it? Cry and get over it. Why worry? She isn't hurting you is she? :)
Eighteen isn't a magic number, people aren't finished developing until 25 anyway. The point is that the adults can, with more experience than a child, guide that child to ask questions that will make clear what choice is right for them. People don't ""suddenly change"" when they hit 18, all the adults in their lives just failed to properly listen to them until they finally had the autonomy to be themselves.
Yeah that kind of sport is usually fine

Serious injuries at a young age can heal wrong quite easily (I guess apart of healing fast) and they’ve not got the durability of adults

And contact sports that hit the damage can cause micro fissures and lead to brain damage - especially on a brain that’s not finished developing 

Dumb that high school kids play American football
Is the average trans woman taller than the average cis woman? Yes.

Should that difference disqualify them from competition? No.

It's important for us to be honest with ourselves and everyone else. Not deny facts. But still assert that trans women should have every right to participate in these and other sports as women.

I'm worried when people say things like you're saying, where you're trying to say something unrelated ""genetic lottery has far more to do with it"" without addressing head on that sometimes 2 inches difference is what makes the difference between being 5'11"" and uncompetitive and 6'1"" and competitive.

I think a better way to say this is ... women with better early childhood nutrition are on average taller as well. Would you block women with better early childhood nutrition from competition as well? No, you wouldn't, all women should be able to participate.
Don't waste time arguing with transphobes, it'll only drag down your mental health. If they were going to be receptive to facts and science, they wouldn't be here.
Your being a mediocre athlete is irrelevant and brings nothing to the table.
The only ""science"" based thing he tried to use against me was that trans women are ""taller"" then cis women, and that they would weigh differently then cis women... As if thats at all science and reasonable.

Like at that point with those idiotic suggestions, you'd also be saying then cis people who are over 6 ft tall cant compete with people who are less then 6ft tall, or people who weigh 250 pounds couldnt compete with people who weighed 200 pounds because the weight/height difference would be some sort of major advantage... Like height and weight isnt a ""trans"" thing, its a human thing everyone of any gender will come in different heights and weights.. like there are cis women who are legit 7ft tall, and cis men who are only 4ft tall .
Except you're the one who was making claims that trans people have an significant advantage when it comes to sports.. when they scientifically dont and have been shown to actually have a disadvantage. 

And no you werent being ironic, denying science isnt ""being ironic"" it's being a science denying transphobe as you're spouting anti trans dialogue by saying that trans people have an advantage in sports when science doesnt agree with that and actually states the latter.

Sorry, but anyone who denies science and spouts right leaning, disinformation lies like ""trans people having an advantage in sports"" is a transphobe in my book.
can you tell me facts, not stereotypes? the average man is 5'9, I bet most of Lia's team are somewhere around there. Idk, she doesn't look drastically taller or more muscular to me. Maybe in the thighs since women carry their strength there on estrogen. Can't you read? I said this already. I'm gonna block you if I have to keep repeating myself. I gave you experts' debunking. What else do you want?

Statistics? Ok, women can be any height, dude. the tallest is cisgender and 7'7. the tallest trans woman is like a  FOOT shorter (6'8) hahaha. Both are gorgeous feminine looking women who would astonish anyone looking for a model. This is from genetics, not testosterone. 

I may not have had efficient T at birth, but I am taller than 90% of the cis guys I encounter since I am talker than 5'9. I was 5'9 at the age of 14. My mom is 5'6, 2"" over 5'4 and she's cis. Some just are taller. There is only a 5"" size gap between male and female so where I am 6'1.5 to be exact, is the height I'm supposed to be.

Some women can have more muscle mass than some men and not be trans, just athletic with a high metabolism. Some may be hormonally imbalanced (PCOS) like I said, or have other conditions like thyroid conditions or the Eddie Hall one I mentioned. Anyways, like I said, I don't like repeating myself so I am going to block you now. Maybe in the next life, you'll figure it out when you find God gave you the same brain and the default (rather than female) body. Would you fake a smile and learn to accept that, which only ever ends up causing regret, depression, eating disorders, anxiety, anger, frustration, and jealousy like Cait's probably feeling for faking being a guy for quite a while mainly due to society holding her back at the time, way post the effects of testosterone on her peak bone mass and her voice (it's never too late, but it gets harder to see yourself and for others to see you and take you seriously)

Living in the closet, you'll have everyone telling tou how to be that gender assigned at birth, but you fail for years at feeling content, not looking awkward around others, or hiding the obvious fact that you'd be wearing a mask — like someone trying to learn a language.


Even if you're good looking either way, you can be trans. It's not about looks or insecurity about looks or how you sound. It's a subconscious preference you'd hate yourself for ever ignoring, like your sexuality - whether asexual, hetero, homo or bi

And bi rhymes with bye now😘👍😬
[removed]
oh, but it does, because it disproves that we have an inherent advantage. If we did, how would it be \*possible\* for me to be a mediocre athlete by women's standards?

The fact that I exist, disproves your basic premise.
Didn't you read me saying that this conversation was over? byeeee
I'm glad we can agree on one thing. Intersexuality isn't a sexuality, just like the terms used for trans and cis ending in -sexuality. It's just the state of someone's sex rather than gender; these are two different things, which can be used interchangibly. People who wish to undergo a full sex change may identify as ""transsexual"" and since not all transgender people do, many do not use this term and may even find it offensive when labelled that. 

Many people still think trans = gay.
Just no.
It's basic math, man. ON AVARAGE men are stronger. That doesn't mean that ALL men are stronger than ALL of women. The real, dramatic difference in power is most evident when people are trying to optimize themselves to be the best athlete they can, and they dedicate their life for it. Starting with even a 10/15% advantage in that context is HUGE.
Ah yes the famous, transphobe runs away when they've been proven wrong lmao
key word there is \*men\*. Men perform that way because of \*testosterone\*, you know, the exact thing we make a point of getting rid of, and replacing with estrogen.

Fact of the matter is we are \*not\* men, and our bodies do not \*perform\* like men's bodies, because we make a \*point\* of feminizing our bodies. That's kind of what transition \*is\*.

You're trying to cite a group of people that we are not, that have athletic enhancing hormones we don't have, to argue that we can do athletically what they can. In what universe is that remotely a logical argument?

Moreover, since when is having a biological advantage a disqualification for sports anyways? You don't see people banning tall people from the NBA for having an advantage or Michael Phelps being banned from swimming despite having several genetic abnormalities that make him better suited for swimming.

the reality is the entire \*concept\* of sports revolves around biological advantages, and there's no real way around that.

Even if we \*did\* have an advantage (which we don't), people get ahead in sports because of biological advantages all the time and nobody cares. So why do they care with us? Because it's all about being transphobic.

Nobody gives a flying fuck if a cis woman happens to be a she hulk of a woman that what were your words ""towers above the other girls"", but suddenly if we are it's a huge issue? Come on man, just admit it you're transphobic, and the \*only\* reason you're making this argument is because of anti trans bigotry. If a cis woman had the \*exact same\* advantages you're bitching about I guarantee I wouldn't hear a peep out of you.

PSA It's okay to not come out today	"Today is a beautiful trans day of visibility and as an out trans guy I'm wearing my colors loud and proud for others who can't.

I've seen a few posts and comments of people planning to come out today and that's great! I'm so happy for those who get to be seen by their loved ones on this day.

But I remember my first trans day of visibility when I was out only to myself, and the second. I felt so much guilt for not coming out, shame when I saw others who had the courage to come out. The second year was the worst. 

It's okay if you can't come out, if it's unsafe to do so or if you're just not ready yet. Today can be the push you need, but it doesn't have to be. Absolutely do it if you want and can, but there's no shame in not doing so or waiting for a better time. You can be proud here with us, proud of yourself for every step you had to take to even be here. We're all in this together, out or not.

So good luck to people coming out today, and good trans day of visibility to everyone! 
💙🩷🤍🩷💙"	"The only day you should feel the push to come out is the day you’re ready. The day YOU decide! It doesn’t have to be a special holiday. 

Nothing will be as special as the day you choose it to be!❤️
Thank you. Needed to hear this today.
I won't be going public today.  I am still boymode in public (locally) after 2 years HRT.  Maybe once. I get ffs I can safely? Come out.  Till then I will hide in fear.  Lol
I needed to hear this today so thanks. I keep getting in my head about wasting time and missing out on life. But I’m not ready today and I guess that’s ok. Thanks stranger ❤️
Thank you for this
I've never come out. Been dating in the queer realm for 3 years, as a trans woman for 2 and throughout haven't really cared about the labels. Never broadcasted it to my friends or family but been living it ever since. Fuck everything, your life is yours and the way you broadcast yourself isn't governed by any rules, regulations or social norms which embody you. I love my boyfriend and he loves me, that's all that matters and happy trans visibility day to you all.
Thanks, I needed this too.
I had it planned out. I was going to post it on my socials, and then talk to my close friends tonight. Whether or not it worked out okay, I was going to go into the weekend with renewed resolve.

That ended up not happening, due to a mixture of plans getting cancelled and not feeling ready to risk my only stable source of income. 

So instead, I played Animal Crossing c:
Thank you for posting this. I'm tentatively out to my online circle but I'm in no way out IRL and I'm far from ready to do that today. So this was nice to read.
I couldn’t agree more! Wait until you’re ready to come out, whenever that is.
This is both wholesome and true. A great combination.

Nice one. Well said.
This is such a wonderful post to come across today. ❤️
💙💙💙
Thank you, man! I appreciate it!
I came out today on social media, but I’ve been slowly coming out to people at work. I feel like today I opened the flood gates and I’m so happy. I received love and support but I’m always anxious about people’s reactions. 

And to anyone who doesn’t feel comfortable to come out today or aren’t in a safe position to do so, you’re still valid. You always have a safe space here.
I'm not out to most of my people. Family, bandmates, and best friend are the only ones who know. Stealth to everyone else. I wouldn't be in any particular danger if i did come out, but I just don't want to. Too much dysphoria.
I've been very tempted to today but just logistically I'm going to be seeing my sister in a week anyway so I might as well wait a little longer
I cant go public because I'm still in the closet to my family, but, ill be wearing the colors and  with the friends that know I'm trans, happy Trans Visibility Day 🏳️‍⚧️💓
People come out on TDOV??
I'm not out because I'm not ready. It's a process and I'm taking it at my own pace. Even so, I felt like it was an important day because I could see the support of others around me, from both trans and cis people, even if they don't know if affects me, and that makes me confident that _when_ I come out, I'll be accepted as I am, and have the support I need around me.
Only a few months into my journey. So I'm only out to myslelf and few trusted friends. Maybe next year. Who knows?
I hold back because of reasons to protect family in this hateful world. Not because I’m not ready. Thank you ❤️🏳️‍⚧️
Thank you! Maybe this is why I’ve been hiding all day. I don’t want to be seen right now. ☺️
another year goes by, and I still am at 0 but maybe one day. I cried this morning over it because its been worse lately
Ironically, after I left this comment, I was part of a conversation at work wherein my experiences as a man (I still present as such) were belittled. I'll avoid detail for sake of throwing huge triggers out on this lovely post, but man I'm pissed off.

Help finding trans friendly tv	"Please don’t suggest a tv show that you aren’t certain is safe.

Sorry in advance for ranting, but

I’m honestly really sick and tired of having no safe cartoons or comfort tv anymore. I keep encountering the most transphobic jokes on every tv show I try to watch.

I can’t find any adult show that feels safe to watch. I’m really tired of turning to entertainment for a distraction from my dysphoria to find that the show is the thing triggering the most pain.

So much adult tv from the usa is incredibly homophobic and severely more blatant about its transphobia. So many cartoons I used to enjoy before my egg cracked became immediately unsafe. Of course Family Guy was never really funny, American Dad isn’t much better, Seth is lazy and hateful in a lot of his comedy. I can’t even watch Impractical Jokers anymore because every episode includes some transphobic joke.

But I’ve been really craving a good cartoon/comedy, so I thought, Bob’s Burgers, family friendly, right? Then I watch, “Sheesh! Cab, Bob?”. Imo very transphobic. Which is a shame because this show felt pretty safe for the queer community to me. That episode, to me, really frames cross dressers as trans people, has them all be sex workers, and then makes a lot of low blows against them. The whole episode filled me with dysphoria, and I feel especially disappointed in this show.

I guess Big Mouth has been pretty safe, and their episode dedicated to creating a trans character was fine, but that’s some of the best rep we get in adult cartoons, and that really disappoints me.

I went to children’s cartoons, but most shows I found that appeal to adults in some way too had some issue with them, even “progressive” cartoons like Gumball. It’s like every cis creator feels a compulsive urge to tell our story for us and do it in a way that harms our community and I don’t get it and I’m so sick of it.

Even a show like Euphoria, which I wouldn’t really call comfort tv, one of the only mainstream sources of trans representation in entertainment, I found to be quite harmful at times. And that’s after enjoying the show and even growing to love Jules as a character. I just didn’t love her as a representative of our community, more so I hated how cis men constantly used her to escape their own queerness, as if loving her proved their gayness. 

Every show I watch feels harmful.

tl;dr:

I feel exhausted and defeated just trying to find a comfort show that won’t make me feel like shit. I know there have to be several out there, but this search has me giving up.

If y’all would share any safe tv shows or movies or even games you’ve found, I would love that so much, and I think many would appreciate seeing several safe titles for trans audiences in one place. 

Thank you all for reading or just giving me this space to vent about one of the most frustrating aspects of this journey for me. Love all of you 🖤"	"Some excellent queer shows off the top of my head:

She Ra: The princesses of power, Arcane (Netflix), What we do in the shadows, Our flag means death (Hulu)

Arcane is the only one without specific trans rep as far as I know, but all of them do queer stuff really well. The two from Hulu are made by Taika Waititi, who is phenomenal with good queer stuff imo. Anything he's majorly involved in is gonna be great in that regard. Our flag means death has realistic gays, enbies and charming comedy.
She-ra and the Owl House are very queer inclusive.
“our flag means death” has a non binary character and there’s no jokes made about them, all the characters are pretty much accepting of them immediately and it’s also a really funny and great show in general. it’s in HBO max if you have it
Bob's Burgers in later seasons is honestly really trans friendly. Marshmallow, one of the trans women, is only ever referred to with she/her pronouns, and in one episode Bob even corrects Linda for calling her handsome by saying ""Marshmallow's not handsome she's beautiful."" Personally, I don't think the episode was meant to paint the trans community as gross crossdressers, but it's completely fine if you still feel that way about the show. Honestly that episode came out around 2013, and I think that's about as inclusive as they were allowed to be without being censored.

I recommend watching Our Flag Means Death. Queer friendly show with multiple gay protagonists and a nonbinary character.
The Owl House, the creator had to fight for including LGBT rep and I'd say its the darkest thing Disney has to offer since Gravity Falls, cause it gets very dark at times, especially season 2
Schitts Creek is a nice fun series imo and the creator is a gay man  has nice lgbt representation without making a big point of characters being gay
ODAAT (one day at a time) not trans centric but elena's wlw partner is nonbinary :) 

it's a very good show (cancelled by netflix, typical) focused on a cuba to america immigrated family just living their lives. many of the subplots (i think that's what youd call it?) are focused on elena's coming out as lesbian and dating her nonbinary partner syd. theyre super cute and i think it's done pretty well
Magnus archives is a good podcast, also helluva boss is a good show
Solar Opposites is a great show. I'm a trans man and I love it. If you look up ""the pupa"" then you've seen what is my newest obsession. The show is great and it has a great homoerotic subplot.
heartstopper came out on netflix yesterday, I watched it and it immediately became a comfort show for me. had some serious themes but overall very wholesome, i loved it so much. it has all kinds of lgbtq+ rep and its really well done
**Brooklyn 99** is an amazing police procedural comedy.  It actually shits on *Ace Ventura* for being transphobic at one point so I'm sure the writers were generally sensitive about trans issues and not putting triggering material.

Similarly, **The Good Place** is amazing and very queer positive.  It's from the same showrunner so it has a lot of shared writers.  I also love **Parks and Recreation** but I wouldn't be shocked if it made a man-in-a-dress joke at some point.  I feel similar about **Community**, it was extremely avante garde and the main character's fragile sense of masculinity is a common thing joked about so I wouldn't be shocked if it has similar even though I can't think of examples.  Still, it's a queer-positive show.  It *does* have a character who's homophobic, but the show also has the other characters shitting on him for it, so it makes a clear message that prejudice is wrong.

If you want to break out of comedy, **The Haunting of Hill House** is a horror series with queer representation and is IMO a masterclass of writing and filmography.  I've seen it three times and keep picking out more stuff.  If you like science fiction, **The Mandalorian** and **The Book of Boba Fett** are both incredible and don't require much prior knowledge of Star Wars canon, except that Boba Fett was eaten by the Sarlacc in *Return of the Jedi* (watch both seasons of **The Mandalorian** first though, the series' plots are intertwined so this matters).
If you're into anime I really recommend zombieland saga. It's pretty funny and light hearted for the most part. Also has one of the main characters is canonically trans (MTF) . Their backstory episode where they're revealed as trans is fucking saaadddd though have tissues ready, but I thought it was extremely well done all around.
Sense8 is my comfort show, it has a trans main character played by a trans woman and is directed by the Wachowskis
Umbrella Academy (Netflix) is a show I haven't seen talked about yet, but it's very good and deals with many sexualities and even tackles homophobia and racism in the second season really well.

And given that Elliot Page came out as trans between season 2 and the upcoming season 3 they already announced that Elliot's formerly presenting as female, Vanya will be transitioning to Viktor.
Once Upon a time is also a good series. Can be kind of heavy but nothing offensive. Plus has very natural representation of gay characters
Perhaps “shezow” might suit you. And there are an increasing amount of drama and documentary style pieces on the ABC, being the Australian Broadcasting Commission…

Hope this helps.
Star Trek Discovery is *very* LGBT-friendly.  It's the first Trek series with an openly gay couple, the first with an openly non-binary character, and there's even a trans character as well!  A number of the cast members are also LGBT too!

Now if you like anime, there's Hourou Musuko/Wandering Son, Bloom Into You, Adachi & Shimamura, and Citrus (though that one is a bit.....well, I'll let you find that out).  There's also Carole & Tuesday, which isn't considered to be LGBT (that I know of), but it's obvious that the two main characters, Carole and Tuesday, have feelings for each other.
Invincible is pretty good, even if it is quite gory at times. For live action, Doom Patrol, the Flash, and Supergirl are good at having queer representation, with Supergirl having a trans woman as a main character in later seasons. Shameless is also very good representation IMO, again with trans characters coming in later seasons. Before that, it did have some moments of transphobia, but once a trans character is introduced, that ignorance/assumptions are challenged head on, and you see the other characters grow as they learn more. 

There's probably more, but those are the ones I can think of now that I haven't seen mentioned yet in terms of representation. Though honestly, it's probably much easier to find comfort shows that don't have representation, but also don't have homophobia/transphobia. There are many more of those than shows with good representation out there.
It's not exclusively trans, but the CW supergirl show has a character named dreamer who is confirmed trans and has an entire episode about her in season 3 or 4, and the show in and of itself is LGBTQ friendly
>I guess Big Mouth has been pretty safe, and their episode dedicated to creating a trans character was fine, but that’s some of the best rep we get in adult cartoons, and that really disappoints me.

Oh, **Bob's Burgers**!  I'm not aware of any trans-specific characters (as in MtF/FtM), but there's a lot of queer representation and a large number of recurring characters who are gender non-conforming.
Hi. I have no suggestions for shows specifically however I do know something that might help. This [website](https://www.doesthedogdie.com) is called ‘Does the Dog Die?’ and it’s essentially got trigger warnings for many categories for many many TV shows, movies, books etc. 

There are tho transphobia-specific categories they use which are listed (taken directly from the website) below:

- There are ""Man in a dress"" jokes
A general category for jokes that involve men dressing/acting in traditionally feminine ways or being gnc (gender non-conforming) being used as a joke or for shock value. Not to be confused with transmisogyny, or calling trans women men in dresses.

- Someone is misgendered


Other categories you may find useful are:

- Someone speaks hate speech 

- There are homophobic slurs 

- An LGBT person dies 

I hope this helps!

Edit: Link didn’t work
craig of the creek, it’s really cute and has a nice story with great characters, it’s arguably the most progressive show to release on cartoon network
I haven't seen anybody mention Umbrella Academy here yet. The writers wrote one of the main characters to be trans after the actor came out.
helluva boss has an r slur drop once in the pilot but it's never heard again and it's pretty darn queer. it's on youtube as it's a webtoon. 

the owl house and she-ra are also fancy, 100% recommend both.

Here are some that I haven't watched but have enough evidence to assume confidently are safe:

I think our flag means death is also cool, though I haven't watch it it has singlehandedly captivated every single one of my queer tumblr mutuals, which tells me that it's safe.

I started watching arcane but got side tracked but this show has thoroughly consumed my trans friends so I assume it's safe, too. 

hazbin hotel, same universe as helluva boss, will be airing soon I suppose, and it's most likely also gonna be safe

eta: the pilot of helluva boss specifically can be a bit harsh and the humor in general is extra mean sometimes. If you want comfort, I definitelly recommend the owl house or shera more
Check out ""She-Ra and the princesses of power."" It's on Netflix
I think you should leace is good for some absurdist sketch comedy.
brooklyn nine nine! it’s a hilarious show and although it doesn’t include any trans characters, it’s a very “woke” show, no transphobic jokes and anytime an LGBTQ+ issue is mentioned in the show it’s dealt with very respectfully while still remaining comedic! i think you would love it.
The best trans friendly show is Pose. Nothing else comes close :)
First Day is a show centred around a young transgirl in school. Saw it on TV and liked it, [so heres the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDTONcPd19Y) I don't know if its only avaliable in australia though..
First Day! It’s an Australian series about a trans girl starting high school. Most accurate depiction of a trans character I have ever seen. Helps that the actress (Evie MacDonald) is trans!
Haven’t really found any trans stuff but queer shows I like:
She Ra: The princesses of power, The Owl House, Infinity Train (Stan) and Hilda

A queer game I enjoy is ‘Life is Strange - True Color’s’
Star Trek Discovery has EXCELLENT LGBT+ representation. a handful of the main characters are apart of the community and the show keeps on top of each characters pronouns very well.
Pose is literally about the ball scenes of the 80s, and has the most transgender cast of any show as of today. Definitely not a comedy though and touches on some sensitive issues.
Heartstopper, not the main character but friends with the main characters and not once did she get dead named or misgendered while in the show
Our Flag Means Death was mentioned a bunch but I definitely liked that they rolled with the NB character without making it a big deal. Pose is great of course, but it does deal directly with a lot of issues that might be triggering.
Heartstopper just launched on Netflix the other day and I binged it earlier today. It's got references to transphobia and has some scenes with homophobia, but overall it's a super wholesome and adorable show where everyone is hella queer. I strongly recommend it!
Star Trek: The Next Generation was exploring topics such as gender identity before it was cool.

A diverse cast, and really ahead of its time.

Star Trek: Discovery has two characters that show up later on, one being trans, and the other being a NB.
The Owl House is one of my favorite TV shows, and its a great show with lots of representation. I've also heard She-Ra and the Princess of Power is good. She-Ra has ended, but the Owl House still has a little bit of Season 2 left (episodes come out every Saturday, and my new favorite came out this Saturday) and a Season 3 planned made up of three special episodes. I haven't watched She-Ra yet, but plan to soon and have been in the community on social media for some time. Both shows have pretty good fandoms.

As for representation in the Owl House, you have a few gay couples (Luz and Amity, Willow Park's parents) a non-binary character (Raine Whispers) and a character with no confirmed gender yet, but the confirmed pronouns he/they (The Collector)

You also have The Legend of Korra. People say it's not that great, and it's not as great as the original Avatar series, but it's really not as bad as people say, and the main character is bi, even though it's not really talked about that much. The community for Avatar and Korra is pretty great tho, and I would recommend.

All in all, would definitely recommend the Owl House and the Avatar series. Again, have not watched She-Ra yet, but people speak of it so highly that it's probably worth watching.
Legends of Tomorrow
I'm gonna recommend a classic and go with Revolutionary Girl Utena, that show is like sailor moon on crack with the queerness turned even higher
Star Trek Discovery (later seasons have a non-binary human character using they/them who comes out and everyone supports especially their gay mentor figures)

Just skip the whole first season. (My opinion: I didn't watch it at all and started with season 2 and enjoyed it.)

It can be dark at times but honestly doesn't require knowledge of previous Star Trek stuff (I don't think, I never watched the original series which is the timeline of the second season of Discovery)

Of course, Owl House, She-Ra, Steven Universe are also ones I recommend
the owl house is a very queer inclusive cartoon, i like it because it clearly presents lgbt characters but the fact that they are lgbt isnt a big deal, its just the way they are, like real people
The Owl house is honestly really good, once you get later into season 1, and season 2 is even better, so that's my recommendation. It has a nonbinary character but there's no direct callout of it, just treated as normal
Please watch Schitt’s Creek. It’s amazing on so many levels. It has a lot of inclusiveness and treats “difference” as if it’s completely normal. I love it so so much.
Heartstopper and Our Flag Means Death. Both shows have prominent trans characters, doesn't define them by their transness but still celebrates it and is good rep!!
The Owl House, without spoiling there's key characters that are queer and there's nonbinary representation. There's also She-Ra and Steven Universe.

There's ones that aren't necessarily trans representation but show queer relationships, like Adventure time and Kipo.
star trek discovery handled it pretty well IMO, probably not perfect but definitely many many leagues ahead of most other stuff out there. they had a gay couple, a nonbinary person, and a trans masc character, all of which were usually played very naturally without shoving it in anyones face too much. 

so far stargate SG1 has been pretty good if u want something more disconnected from the subject entirely. Its pretty old and more action oriented so it seems to be more or less oblivious of those type of issues. im only up to season 4 so far tho, so take that with a grain of salt.


Big bang theory is a hard pass, blatant transphobia less than 5 minutes into the first episode. not to mention it's really annoying. (like seriously, never have i ever been so immediately put off by a show before i watched BBT)
>Big Mouth

About this (just as a tangent). The first time I watched the episodes with the trans character I just thought ""neat"". I re-watched it after coming out as non-binary and oh my it hit a lot harder at that point.
I bet someone has already said it but The Owl House. They even have a [canonically trans character](https://theowlhouse.fandom.com/wiki/Raine_Whispers).
Haven’t seen anyone else mention it, but I personally love the Netflix show 3%. It’s Brazilian so originally in Portuguese. The trans representation isn’t overt but there’s a casually trans fem character in the later seasons and there’s a beautiful performance by trans Brazilian artist Liniker. Also a couple times there’s just casually but definitely intentionally a trans flag visible in the background of a shot. I dig it :)
She-Ra is THE queer show imho. You will love it
The 1990’s moomin cartoon. There’s nothing explicitly queer in it, but it’s just a really comforting show
Our Flag Means Death has a nonbinary character, who is played by a nonbinary actor, Vico Ortiz. It's beautiful.

Good Omens is pretty good. There's a nonbinary character there too. And they're making a second season.

Umbrella Academy has Elliot Page in it, and apparently after he came out as trans they have decided to make his character transgender in the next season!

I really like The Old Guard. Not really anything transgender going on, but there's plenty of gay power couples fighting bad guys with swords.
this might not be the best honey but. I think you need to grow some thicker skin. Reality hurts whether you're trans or not. 

I think doing this will be better and healthier on you in the long run rather than sequestering the shows that make you feel uncomfortable.
[removed]
euphoria ?
I recommend Glee and She-Ra: the princess of power. Both of these have absolutely amazing LGBT representation.
euphoria!!!
Pose! It's a really good show with a good representation of the trouble that Trans folks had in the 80's and 90's new York city ball scene. Well, that's a terrible explanation, I'm bad at explaining stuff, so here is a link: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7562112/

It's got quite a lot of Trans actors in it and it's just a good TV show. Should be on HBO max for you Americans i believe, it's on Crave in Canada
pose, we are who we are, genera+ion... those are the best recommendations I can think off the top of my head
I would help but I only watch Japanese tokusatsu which the only things I can think of off the top of my head where they actually bring up lgbtq+ is Naki from Kamen rider Zero-one identifying as non-binary. Also the donut seller from KR Wizard. And Oren Pierre from KR Gaim.
Overall, nothing transphobic or non-lgbtq+ in tokusatsu.
Pose!  The protagonista are trans and by the last two seasons most episodes were written and/or directed by trans folks.  It does have some difficult moments also moments of pure joy. 

There is a documentary about Miss Major called “Major” that I also highly recommend.
I've always liked Infinity Train on Hulu. There are multiple queer-coded characters in the show. There is one character in particular who is a strong allegory for transitioning/trans identity
One piece has great trans representation, albeit like 900 episodes in
owlHouse
Have you seen twin peaks? I know, it’s a cis actor playing as a trans woman, but it’s a show from 1990, it was already controversial enough to have a trans character that isn’t ridiculed or the butt it the joke, nobody would have aired a series with a trans woman in the cast. 

It’s still on of the best representations of a trans woman!! 
I won’t spoil you, but from the very first moment you meet this character you know she’s trans, and everyone accepts her as a woman. And there’s absolutely no reason for her to be trans, this could be a completely cis character, or even a man, and it wouldn’t change a thing. There’s was no necessity to put her! Still David lynch decided to put a trans character because he could.
another vote for she ra, and also i'd recommended dickinson, and star vs the forces of evil
Ok so not a show but a great spooky podcast is ""hello from the hallowoods""


The setting is uh... complicated to say the least but I reccomend you try an episode or 2 to see if you like the spooky queer stuff!


It has many, many queer characters, is made by a queer host and a really cool spooky vibe that reminds me of autumn and makes me feel safe and comforted (though that's probably just because I have a thing for autumn and Halloween and find them really comforting)


Other than that though ""I am not ok with this""

The soundtrack is amazing and it's a really good short show that I enjoyed every second of thoroughly, it has some sexuality exploration and stuff and is queer friendly (though there is homophobia but, like, villainous homopobia where its clearly shown as shitty and wrong) it doesn't have any trans characters though but I can't not recommend this to anyone


Ok last edit this time probably but Steven universe is really fun and has an awesome vibe to it, especially in the later seasons and oh my god all of the music (not just the songs) is amazing and I fucking love it, it's one of my favourite shows ever and my god are some of the plot points and stuff emotional
One of my go-tos for LGBTQ tv suggestions is The Owl House
i mean 911 lone star has a trans character who is also trans themself(i think)
Money heist! Or la casa de papel is its official name. It features a trans woman, and a couple of homosexual men. It also has a lot of fascists being killed and shit. Don’t watch if you’re sensitive to violence or robberies or anything like that. I hope this helps!
I love “ somebody somewhere”. On hbo.  There’s lots of queer ppl as characters and they do a really good job not being transphobic, gl!
Jules is played by a trans actor as well .
Well i just finished Heartstopper today so that was the first thing that came to mine however, they don't really bring up that the trans character is trans as well as she's not the main character
The good place is the best show I've ever seen
I’m surprised nobody mentioned Pose(even though I wouldn’t exactly call it comfort TV) by Ryan Murphy. It’s about the ballroom scene in NYC in the late 80’s-early 90’s. The show had the biggest ensemble of trans characters, and they’re all played by trans actresses. It gets a little intense at times but overall I highly recommend it.
If you're looking for an adult cartoon that's LGBT positive, I'd go with Arcane. Very serious story, and kinda made in the style of anime to some degree.

Edit: It's on Netflix's as an original.
Steven universe

She-Ra

Pose

That's all the shows I can think of unfortunately 😋
If it wasn’t mentioned and you’re the right age try Sense8. TW for some serious stuff but great representation and some truly affirmative depictions of queer and trans characters. 

Like I said TW for serious content but if you’re of age to watch mature a Netflix show give it a shot and fast forward like I do when I need to.
I dig infinity train as a show that deals with trans themes respectfully and in an interesting way in the second season, even if the studio made the creators present a char they intended to be trans as cis. Ultimately it still means a lot to me, and all of those elements still shone thru to me. I also really love steven universe, and have to agree with all the people saying owl house!
Not an LGBTQ show or anything, but I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson is an amazing sketch comedy show thqt also has a trans actor at a few points too
I'm going to recommend Pose every time I see a post like this because I don't see it enough. It's on Hulu, has fantastic transfem and gay representation, tells wonderful and meaningful stories. Goes into found family themes, what it actually means to be a mother, how living with AIDS doesn't have to be a life sentence, etc.
I really like Steven Universe and Craig of the Creek (can watch both on STAN)I haven’t seen many shows that have out lgbtq characters but I agree with you say ngl.. after some research Danger & Eggs, OK K.O.! Let’s Be Heroes, The Loud House, The Dragon Prince, Ready Jet Go!, Twelve Forever and MLP have the most lgbtq characters in them. Hope this helps! :D

SENSE8
Sense 8 is frankly one of the most beautiful lgbtq+ inclusive shows I've ever seen. One of the main characters is a trans woman and while there is some mild transphobia from her mom, it's short lived as she escapes that household.
The OA on netflix has a transmasc character that is done well I think, plus the show itself is pretty phenomenal. The first episode is slow but I promise its worth it
I also really enjoyed Sense-8 which has both gay and trans representation in it! 😊
Try Rick and Morty if you're looking for a trans friendly comedy.
Not a show, but a movie. 

The Danish Girl (Netflix) 

To sum it up, The Danish Girl is about Lili and her experience going from male to female in the early 1920's. I will let you know that this movie, as it's set in an early time period, does not have many comforting characters to Lili. There are showcases of treating Lili being transgender (which is a word never used, due to the time period) as a mental disorder, as well as nudity. As horrible as the other people are in this movie, it is such a beautiful one, and it is based on a true story. It shows the real struggles of being transgender and finding oneself, especially in that time period, and the end is lovely.
Heartstopper launched on Netflix a couple days ago - it's fantastic. It does howwever contain some homophobia, directed against the gay protagonist, who is also the victim of some on-screen SA (1 fairly short scene, with repercussions).
Dafne and The Rest on HBO Max is one of the best trans shows I have ever seen. It is Spanish though, so subs, but it's written, produced and directed by a trans woman. Very funny, but also truthful and touching. Loved it.
As long as you like cop shows, Brooklyn 99 is incredibly inclusive and their captain is a black gay man. Plus it's fucking hilarious and me and all my trans friends watch it when we smoke weed.
I don’t recall any particular queerphobia in *The Good Place*. In fact, the main character flirts with sapphic desire from time to time.
For cartoons people haven't mentioned yet: Kipo and the age of wonderbeasts (more aimed at kids) and Q-force.
You might not find it ""comfort tv"" because there is some violence/heavy topics but DC's legends of tomorrow is really great. It's one of my favorite shows. There's tons of queer rep (unfortunately no trans people tho that I can remember) however there is a gender fluid character
how do we feel about sex ed? it’s my absolute favorite and i think the trans representation (nb characters in S2) is really nicely done
Sex Education on Netflix has lots of queer representation, enby, and next season a trans ""power couple""
**Our flag means death** is a great show about queer pirates. It's not a cartoon and doesn't have transfem rep so far, but multiple gay couples and a nonbinary character are important characters. All of those queer characters are well-written and their queerness is prominent in the story, but still never their most important struggle or only defining character treat.
Thank you very much! I will definitely be checking out all of these. I really appreciate you giving me a safe creator to look out for, too!
Don't forget Steven universe!
Arcane and what we do in the shadows are both incredible
Came here to say this
They did joke about it really well. I busted out laughing when the Swede asked if Jim wasn’t going to be Jim anymore, could he be Jim.
This show is honestly so good about not making jokes about characters innate characteristics. There is a main character with a lisp, not a single joke about it.
100% agree with your bobs burger explanation. I think bobs burgers is one of my favorite shows because it’s safe and inclusive but also genuinely funny and light hearted.
Agreed, later season bobs burgers is definitely queer-friendly but the first couple episodes are definitely yikes. Like, the one op mentioned does a bit where it zooms in on the trans womens' stubble and they joke about having penises and stuff. Love that show but always skip that episode lol

Side note I headcanon Gene as trans and it makes the show even more fun to watch
I didn’t even realize marshmallow was trans wtf
I can only agree with your recommendation of Our Flag Means Death.
owl house fans how we feeling after hollow mind
yes! schitts creek >>
[Relevant](https://youtu.be/gdcmhvLaNUs)
Norman Lear is a legend for a reason.
This show always made me a bit uncomfortable with the portrayal of the one Jewish character but it's still a really important show to me because it was the first time I saw a coming out scene handled with respect
I'm sorry for coming off as rude, but how can a woman be lesbian, and love a non-binary person? Isn't that invalidating for their non-binary partner? Wouldn't she be pansexual? Isn't lesbian a term that falls under the sapphic umbrella?
It's really fun and silly. Then you get the dramatic Wall side plot.
was just about to say this!!! i love trans characters like elle who just get to be happy
i came here to suggest this show as well. just as a warning to those who aren’t familiar, it deals with homophobia pretty explicitly and transphobia to a far lesser extent. it doesn’t get violent, but it doesn’t shy away from those topics. it’s a fantastic show and i would agree it is so wholesome and the rep is done very thoughtfully, but i’d imagine it could be triggering for some
It’s also a webcomic, for any people more interested in reading
Community is by far my favorite show but there are definitely some ""man in a dress"" type jokes. The jokes themselves aren't actually inherently transphobic, but I can see how it could definitely prove dysphoric for some.
Was gonna say B99!!! They also have an openly gay and openly bi character in it!
I loved the good place !!! And Brooklyn 99
If we're talking anime, Houseki no Kuni is also a good one. Literally all but 2 of the named characters (plus a third one who... might not be? Not sure yet) in the series are non-binary.

It's... hard to explain.
Once upon a time isn't *offensive* by any means, but definitely keep in mind before watching this show you'll probably have a heck of a headache trying to keep the family tree sorted out in your head lol
Queer representation aside, how is the series as a whole? I've heard conflicting reviews
I adore shezow!
TIL what ABC means in tv world
I vaguely remember this show
Plus that was from their first season and the show has been on over a decade at this point.
Yes!
The Owl House actually does have a non-binary character, Raine Whispers!
OFMD is my new favourite show by far. I'm kinda obsessed with how queer it is.
>You also have The Legend of Korra. People say it's not that great, and it's not as great as the original Avatar series, but it's really not as bad as people say, and the main character is bi, even though it's not really talked about that much. The community for Avatar and Korra is pretty great tho, and I would recommend.

I will always recommend The Legend of Korra. The Bryke had to fight tooth and nail just to get Korrasami to hold hands in 2014.
That's the best part about it. Too many shows make their queer character such a big deal. In The Owl House, queer is simply normal. No one makes a big deal of it, all of the queer characters are just living their lives as normal people in The Boiling Isles and no one has a problem with it, just as it should be in real life.

&#x200B;

Its one thing for a show to have a queer character. Its another thing for a show to present queerness as normal and I think this is the better direction to go, and The Owl House just does it so darn right.
>Steven Universe

Just an interesting side note, Stevonnie is technically agender/non-binary, and the creator of the show (Rebecca Sugar) is also non-binary I believe.
Honestly, it’s fine that you are not so bothered by representation issues, but representation matters to a lot of people. I appreciate that you mean to be helpful, but I disagree that the solution to harmful tv is to grow a thicker skin to hatred. If people accept our media as trash then it won’t get better. Telling someone experiencing dysphoria to grow a thicker skin doesn’t sound like a healthier option to me than advocating for change. I won’t be watching tv that makes fun of my community and makes me feel like shit, but thanks for the advice.
I always thought that was the case, but growing a thicker skin incorrectly implies that you’re just fortifying yourself. What it really means in the way that we use the phrase is fundamentally changing the standards that you personally hold media to by partially numbing yourself to slights against your community. I get that this works for some people but I should be able to watch a show or movie without having my identity insulted by some idiot staying afloat with overused biases. 

Sorry for the rant I guess
i have such thick skin that i dont get bothered by transphobia as much as i should be (i don’t actually have thick skin im just weird)
South Park? Really I mean it’s not trans friendly at all
I second the recommendations of She-Ra and Steven Universe, both include proud lesbian relationships, (some of which are loving, healthy, and just generally adorable... Spinerella and Netossa, anyone? Loving wifeys) and Steven Universe even has a lesbian wedding in a plot important episode so no one could censor it out. xD

SU-F also includes a non-binary human character, which is always great to see.

I haven't properly watched Infinity Train, but I am aware of Lake, who starts out being seen as female and... appears to have a character development journey towards becoming either a trans man or a nonbinary individual, and I saw enough to feel touched by the compassion of the portrayal.
Arcane hasn’t confirmed anything explicitly, but the writers have made it really clear that they intended for Caitlyn and Vi to be gay for each other and that they’re just slow burning the fuck out of it.

Which checks out since season 2 just got confirmed!
And Infinity Train!
WE ARE THE CRYSTAL GEMS
Yeah The Owl House has a non binary character and is just a really damn good show!
that was so good 😭
yes! as a disabled person im so used to jokes in shows about peoples disabilities and stuff, i was super pleasantly surprised about the lack of jokes about stuff like that. such a breath of fresh air
Omg, me too. Gene has *biiiiiiig* egg vibes
oof
Currently dying. Knew it was coming but it hit hard lol
A lot of things
One of the most beautiful scenes in all of television <3
wait who was the one jewish character? i dont remember that
lesbian means non-men loving non-men, not strictly women loving women! i understand your confusion though, saying ”wlw partner is non-binary” is basically saying that the non-binary person in question is a woman loving woman. but my point is that the term lesbian includes non-binary folk.
Wall side, just kills me with its brilliance...
[deleted]
Lol yes the family tree is wack in this show
Its funny I didnt even know about it until getting with my boyfriend who loves it and so we watched it together, so idk what issues people take with it but I really enjoy it. Has lots of likeable characters and interesting storyline. Fun to see the ways they twist around these already familiar characters into something new
The American ver is American Broadcasting Company I believe
I'm not the original commenter, but I really appreciate your response. It's kind of like queer bars. I *can* go to a regular bar and be totally fine. But there is so much value in going to a bar who acknowledges you as a valid person without having to wade through mountains of bigotry.
i honestly dont see it as hatred :/ it's jokes. they're comedies. It makes fun of everything and everybody. Including us. Thats inclusion in my eyes, not hate. Family guy has kept quagmires trans parent in as a character and is taken more seriously i feel than when she was first introduced. Thats representation. in American dad steve seriously questions his gender identity in one episode. 

I hope i haven't upset. Shows i don't believe I've seen transphobia in (but you and i probably have different definitions) are Archer, rick and morty, the new star wars shows like mando, and killing eve. Some comedy there, some drama, some sci fi depending on what you're into.
yeah actually. I have thick skin and am numb to the abattoir trucks. But with ""transphobia"" i have a much different conceptualisation and so it's not like my thick skin has anything to do with enjoying south park or family guy. I liked these shows before my transition and continue to like them now.
Kinda, agree, but the thing with southpark imo is that they just dont spare anyone. I do have to admit that the whole Mr Garrison parts in the early season and then later 2 episodes were bad. But recently it has gotten a lot better if you ask me :0
I mean they more than clearly are. What confirmation do you want lol
We’ll always save the dayyyyy

And if you think we can’t…
yeah owl house is great and it will be safe for your sexuality and identity but if watch that show your emotions in general will be in terrible danger
>Dean Pelton is one of my favourite characters, lol. He's a walking egg imo..

Somehow when I speculated that **Community** *may* have ""man in a dress"" humor, I completely forgot about Dean Pelton.

IMO, Dean Pelton knows exactly who he is.  This comes out from time to time.  He's intentionally coy, not in denial or confused.
That freaking American dad episode where Steve questions his gender with that roller derby group actually helped me realise I was trans, because it said that trans people could be gay too. Absolutely amazing episode if you ask me xD
I really disagree about the ""It isn't hate because it is a joke"" jokes based only on we existing are really dangerous, jokes that portrait us as criminals, sluts or sick aren't jokes.
When you make a joke about a group that has no representation, esp when the show itself doesn’t have it, that becomes how people think about us. These jokes are the jokes some peoples families make about them behind their backs. Some of these jokes/ “representation” are just downright transphobia
I just feel like it should be ok to get pissed when something seems like pointless transphobia. The expectation shouldn’t be to lower your standards for creators of media because it’s normal for them to say some of this shit.
Which is interesting coming from Seth MacFarlane, because Family Guy has been suuuuper trans/homophobic forever.
THANK YOU. 

Also super glad it helped you figure stuff out 🤗
it makes fun of everything tho, not like its a targeted hate campaign. How did any program i mention portray us as any of those things? :/
i JUST gave an example about how family guy DOES have representation tho... how is quagmires dad turned mom born of transphobia?. It shows her as a recurring character going about her life. She gets with a guy (brian) at a bar/hotel, and they have a great time, but there after hes ashamed to be seen with her. How is that anything but going through trans issues, i know I've had that before, guys wanting to meet in secluded areas and things. I no longer tolerate that kinda asshole. It goes about these things the only way a childish cartoon comedy thats only on for 20 minutes can :/
i like how pointless transphobia implies that some transphobia has a point xD but ye. creators are gonna create what they want. I just don't think family guy or American dad is transphobic. If they are they're also anti-semitic, racist (against every race), sexist, homophobic, celebrity slandering, obesity shaming, etc. 

its a stupid silly cartoon with a time traveling baby and an alcoholic aging dog. non of it should be consumed as if it's serious.
I mean idk. They are just fucking with everyone and making jokes at every ones expense (just like southpark). Stuff like that never bothers me."	uagykc	trans	479	0.96	2022-04-23 22:55:01
Is it possible that I'm just not trans anymore?	"I've known that I am trans for about 5 years now and I have repressed that but I feel like my dysphoria has faded over time due to my parents. They're conservatives and if they'd find out I am trans they, and the rest of my family (they are also conservatives) will probably disown me and shame me infront of other family members and that would make my life even worse. It's already hell having to live life as a man but it'd be significantly worse if I came out or transitioned and went on to live life as a woman because my family would likely never accept me.

This has kind of caused my dysphoria to fade to the point where I'm thinking I shouldn't transition and that I'm not trans. and that maybe it's better for my own mental health to just man up.

And I don't think I'd ever want to take female pronouns either. Nobody will accept me if I do so and it would just make my life harder. Maybe if the world was more accepting I would have a different opinion.

Am I just not trans anymore? If you barely have gender dysphoria anymore how can you even be trans?

Sorry if my post seems incoherent. I'm just in a dark place mentally."	"You are repressing and it is possible but not sustainable
From my experience, dysphoria lessened when I was in the darkest places, because these numbed everything down including dysphoria.
""It's already hell having to live as a man...""

I believe this is the key sentence in your text. If you were not trans anymore, then why would you word it that way?
You are basically just planning to hide it from your family. And I think you are trying to make yourself believe that you are not trans because of it.
So the reasons you’re stating for not transitioning or changing your pronouns aren’t “I don’t want to transition or change my pronouns because I don’t think that would be a good fit for me” they are “people would never accept me” and “I should just man up.” I’m not telling you what you are or aren’t, but that doesn’t sound like “not trans” as much as it sounds like you don’t want to be ostracised for being trans.

You say yourself that you might feel differently if the world was more accepting. A cis person would not choose to become trans if the world were more accepting of trans people. They would still be cis.

Again, not telling you who you are or what you have to do. But choosing not to transition out of fear is not the same as not being trans.

I would suggest you look into mental health resources and support groups in your area if you can, you sound like you’re in a rough place right now and have kind of resigned yourself to it. Things can get better for you. No matter what you decide about yourself and what you choose to do about it.
If you don’t want to transition because the people around you aren’t accepting, that doesn’t mean you’re not trans. It just means you’re in a transphobic environment and in order to survive you’ve been forced to repress your feelings. 

Maybe right now you don’t feel dysphoric, but even if it didn’t exist then that wouldn’t make you cis. Being trans is about wanting to be a gender that you weren’t assigned with at birth. 

I’m sorry this isn’t an easy answer, but if you were cis then this wouldn’t be a difficult decision for you. I hope you find a better living situation soon and are able to live in a way that is true to yourself!
You don’t require gender dysphoria to be trans. I hardly have dysphoria any more, i used to have it so badly when i first came out. Sometimes it fades away. It doesn’t mean you are less trans.
You might lose everything but you might learn to love yourself girl.
One way gender dysphoria is so insidious is that it fluctuates. One day you'll be certain you're a girl, the next day it might barely be anything and you really doubt yourself. Those strong feelings will return. Just keep pressing forward with your plans, you'll be happy you didn't waste any time when GD comes back! 🙃
You're definitely numbing yourself. Its a survival technique. 

It is your choice to transition or not or even ever come out or identify yourself as trans, but i would definitely be careful about becoming numb to everything else in life. Its very easy to start going through the motions and never find joy. 

There are alternatives to binary trans identities, if that's why you couldn't have feminine pronouns. I dress very androgynously and have been taking hormones only at a rate that feminizes me slightly. On days where i need to present like a man, i still can. Otherwise i dress kind of soft-butch and use they/them. 

There are a multitude of options, and you dont have to be out everywhere and all at once. But always put your safety and health first, and recognize that no one else knows your life better than you.
""Maybe if the world was more accepting""

Just because you decide you don't want to transition does not mean you stop being trans, as much as you may want it to.

Best of luck.
you don't have to have dysphoria to be trans. also, this sounds less like your dysphoria fading and more like you repressing yourself to the point that you don't even let yourself feel the dysphoria? (idk if that's actually a thing tho)
I thought this way all through my twenties. I thought, oh it’s just a phase, I just need to man up, it’ll disappear eventually and I’ll be a normal hetero male…..
I got to 30 and those things never happened. I never felt comfortable being a man. I had a good job, gf, car, but it never made me happy. 
Once the androgyny of youth started to fade I fell apart and had to admit to everyone and myself that I’m just not the person I was trying to be.
I don’t how you feel exactly, but it sounds like you may be struggling with similar things that I do.
Im much happier after transitioning.
My brother and dad are a little weird about things, but they accept me enough not to disown me.
My mom loves it I think cuz now she realizes I liked shopping and all that stuff she thought she was forcing on me that we did together.
If you don’t have any family support then it’s incredibly difficult, from what I’ve heard. I don’t have that issue fortunately so it’s something to consider if you do.
I hope you find peace with yourself no matter what you choose is best for you 🫂
I didn't go away you're just ignoring it. It'll come back and strotnger. You can't help whom you are and that isn't something that generally changes.
I “man upped” for almost 40 yrs. It has gotten me nowhere but miserable. Pushed away everyone I ever cared about trying to man up. I hate to say this but it doesn’t go away. It’s possible to repress it hit each time it comes back, it’s worse. Took my wife leaving and saying I was happier dressed as a woman for it to finally click that you can’t just run away. If you don’t have a therapist, find one. Mines the best and their partner is trans so they understand my issues but I’m 9 months into my transition and also in the middle of a separation from my wife who “was” supportive until it became real. I’m not trying to be a Debbie downer, just wanted to tell you a little about my wonderful mess. It does get better but only when u accept yourself.. I wish u the best and hope you do what’s best for you. I wish I had done this sooner 😊
As someone who ostracized and disenfranchised themself due to being a MtF amateur voice actress for similar reasons, I can safely say that in similar circumstances I've internalized it myself like this before. In an environment of hatred and guilt, it can only breed more hatred and guilt. Acceptance is something worth fighting for in a world where we're all being divided by the color of our skins, how we pee and babymake, and what's between our legs.

In isolation and self reflection, I do have some advice for you. Do with this what you will:

There are people in this world who would rather see you as a sum of your pieces rather than what you are as a whole, a human being with aspirations and dreams. If you feel you were born in the wrong body, that is still a form of dysphoria called body dysmorphia (help me if I butchered that.) From the way you wrote that, at least in my mind, I'd say you hear what they (your family, illogical conservatives, and a few bigots) say about transfolk and you worry that they won't treat you the same anymore.

Once you reach a certain age, your only true duty is to your own preservation of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It's like that Jack Stauber song 'Dead Weight' says.

""What I control is in me.""

You aren't what they say, you are what you feel.

If it isn't illegal by the time you can transition, and you feel like it will improve your quality of life for you personally, then pardon my language, but fuck what everyone else says. The only power they have is the power you give them, as with all human individuality. Outside influence like vile and vitriolic comments, threats of violence, etc. Is all a tactic to enforce conformity over individuality. 

Be true to you, ignore what they do, regardless of what your decision is in the end.
Upping your coping skills or repressing your feelings of dysphoria doesn't mean you're not trans. It might just mean that your subconscious has been building up defenses against the emotional pain you expect would come your way if you came out.

I didn't know I was trans until I was 45. I had no idea I had massive gender dysphoria, because over those years, I developed some hella-good coping skills. But none of that means I'm not still trans.

You can repress it for a while, especially if there are strong emotional motivations at play. But it comes back out eventually and you'll wish you came out sooner rather than sacrificing all those years on the altar of appeasing a family whose small-minded attitudes won't let them love and accept you like true family should.
Hun, I ain't surger coating shit. You're repressing it so deep that you're no longer feeling pain. But it's still hurting you. It'll slowly tear you apart, even if you don't realize it. This is something that if not taken care of, will utterly break you when it all finally hits (take my word on it). Your family can go straight to hell, and all go fuck themselves. If you get stable, cut them all out, and make yourself happy.
Are you honestly thinking your not trans or are you just scared of not being accepted? It honestly sounds like you’re scared of not being accepted and that fear is overtaking your dysphoria.
When I was younger it was easier to repress myself. But with getting older and more stress situation the dysphoria has hitted me back very strongly. So yes you can repress for years and years, but one day in future it will collapse.
Sounds like you're repressing, you're dissociated from your gender. That can be useful given your unaccepting environment, but long term it's only going to make you miserable. Please find some kind of outlet where you can be yourself freely without judgement, for your own mental health's sake.
There are a lot of possibilities. Perhaps you misinterpreted something else as dysphoria to begin with, perhaps you had dysphoria and it somehow went away (which, if it went away without anything worse taking its place, is not necessarily a bad thing), or maybe you (or your external circumstances? are just repressing your dysphoria. I think the last one is the most likely.

I think something to keep in mind is that medically speaking, gender dysphoria is defined as a mental illness for which statistics and research has shown transition to be the most effective treatment by far. This is not to say the couldn't be other treatments, just that they are so unlikely to work that generally the only medically responsible treatment path is transition.

However, the human mind is too complicated to reduce to such simple terms, so you can't rule out any possibilities such as gender dysphoria going away. If that is the case, it's not a bad thing. Transition is tough anyway. (also, we aren't r/truscum here, so even if you aren't dysphoric, if transitioning gives you enough euphoria to be worth it to you, go ahead, no judgement)

A trick that the human mind plays much more frequently, though, is to allow certain things to take over your emotions. If you are in an extremely stressful environment, your environmental stresses may override your dysphoria and make it seem like you don't have dysphoria anymore. This is similar to how conversion therapy gives the illusion of curing people - diminish one bad thing by covering it up with something much worse (in the case of conversion therapy they are basically trying to weaponize PTSD as a medical treatment which you can imagine how well that works).

Without further info, I think this last case is the most likely. I understand you are probably not in a position where you are free to do these things, but if possible, talk to a therapist or talk to one through online resources, especially LGBT related ones. A therapist would be able to tell you more than someone on the internet can.
I would focus on euphoria rather than dysphoria in this situation. What makes you feel good about yourself? What makes you feel more “you” ? This is more important than focusing on the bad feelings. I know you feel unsafe trying to transition, which is totally understandable, but is it more that you don’t want to or you don’t think you can? If you could live anywhere you wanted, with any friend group, and access to proper medical care, what would you do then?
So I repressed *hard* each time I tried to explore my gender identity, and my ex used it as an excuse for more abuse/to shove past my boundaries. I have felt sick for nearly a decade and told myself I didn’t know why. 

Honestly, it sounds like you just need to find a way to get some space. Breathe. Get your ducks in a row so you can leave your family behind. *No-one* is worth denying who you are, not family, not friends, not partners. The people who love you for who you are are your real family, not just people with whom you share a few chromosomes.
Only you can know that. And denial is never an answer, no matter how many lies you’re told by the ignorant
I can’t tell you what you are feeling or need, but the way you are talking about this sounds like the reason your dysphoria has reduced is via disassociation.  It sounds like you hate “living as a man” but are locking those feelings away to deal with your parents.

Whether you are trans or not isn’t a question of what your parents need you to be.  It’s a question of what *you* need to be.  If you don’t need to transition then okay.  There is no pressure here.  Do what you need to do.

But if your parents are the reason why you feel that way, and you are suffering because you have to “live as a man” as you’ve indicated… then it doesn’t really sound like dysphoria is gone, does it?
I would say not likely.  It was the same for me.  I was able to repress it for years and years.  It was always there, boiling under the surface.  A constant itch I couldn't scratch.  A dull ache.  


It \*will\* come back with a vengeance.  And it will get harder and harder as the years go by.  Aging as a ""man"" has a way of bringing dysphoria front and center!
I know what you mean and I often struggle with the same negative thoughts of ""its not worth the pain"" or ""The world will never let me be happy"" and somedays I don't ""feel very trans"" and somedays I do but idk but after having probably one of the worst weeks I'd had in a long time and I started to doubt my transness but I when I think about living as a man I become despondent and depressed so that pain lets me know I'm trans even if its not ideal and I feel your doubts are also coming from a place of fear and I know how terrible that feeling of not being accepted.
Gender is a very complicated concept and, for many people, can’t be defined by any binary. And people choose many different ways to express that gender. The vast majority of people present their gender in the way that is stereotypically “correct” in society (i.e. afab presenting as women and amab presenting as men). However trans people and people who otherwise don’t fit on the binary must put more thought into gender and presentation. I, for one, am afab with a nonbinary gender. I experimented with presentation, but in the end I just landed right back at a feminine presentation. My gender never changed, but my presentation and dysphoria levels did. I also know trans people (mostly those whose dysphoria isn’t severe) who have chosen never to transition. Your journey is your own, your labels are your own, and you get to define yourself however you wish to.
This sound more like repression to me. You want to live as a woman, but you're scared that people won't accept you if you do, so you push it down and numb your feelings, even subconsciously, to keep yourself safe, right? Whether you are trans or not is just whether you want to use that term for yourself, which is usually based on how you feel inside, and all of that can absolutely change.

 I think you should think long and hard about what matters to you, if you aren't already. Is the conditional love of family worth more that living as yourself? Are there places you can go where people *would* support you? Are you willing to go searching for those kinds of people even if it's hard? 

Living life as yourself can be incredibly enriching. You'll find people that hate you for it, but you also find people who love you for it, and that love I'd more authentic that any love based on a lie.
No because conversion doesn’t work. You can never get rid of who you truly are. You’d only be repressing it and that could cause even worse of mental health issues for you later on just because it’s not good to suppress stuff like your emotions and how you feel. If you actually had gender dysphoria at some point, chances are, you still have it. But since you’ve been suppressing it for so long, you could have just tricked your mind into thinking that you don’t have it anymore by wishing that you weren’t trans and trying to hold it down. The mind is a powerful place so I wouldn’t be surprised if you’ve only tricked your mind into believing what you wish could be the case. You’re thinking that there will only be bad consequences that come from being yourself so therefore you don’t want to be yourself. But safety should be your first priority and if you have a super hateful family to the point of which you may be in danger, then it’s best to stay in the closet for the time being. That’s if you’re still a child anyways. If you’re an adult and have enough money to move out, then just come out if you feel like you’re ready and if you’re family doesn’t accept you then fuck them. For each family member and friend you have IRL right now that won’t accept you…trust me…there are 100 times more people in the community in which you can meet and build a connection with who will accept you. But all of this is just my take and my input. Just don’t lie to yourself really. That’s the last bit of advice I want you to keep close to your heart. If you are really trans then don’t be afraid to be you just because of family.
Been there, tried that, didn't work & almost killed me. 

1- you don't have to change your pronouns if you don't want to, but please don't base that decision on whether or not you think new pronouns will be accepted, base it on which ones you wish had always been used for you.
2- sure, repressing yourself can & does work. But is it really worth hating yourself, to make other people more comfortable?
3- not everybody who is trans experiences dysphoria with their body, some just feel ""this doesn't match my brain"" But there's no crippling self-loathing attached to it
4- not everybody who is trans chooses to transition - and those who do all choose their own path, which works for them. There's no ""You must do A B and C"" of transitioning or of being trans. It's a wholly personal experience.
5- there's no nicer or kinder way of saying this: your family is not the world. Does it suck if your family who are supposed to love you unconditionally, don't? Yes. Absolutely, yes. But there's a whole world of people out there, who aren't your family and who will accept you with no questions asked. There are people who will love you and support you and be there for you. There are people who will  want to know more & discover everything about you. There are people who will be your family, once you meet them. This family that you're with right now seem like the most important people in the world, because they're all you've known up to this point. But I promise you, they're not. I promise you, there are people out there waiting on you to join their family, where you'll be accepted without doubt or conditions.
Let me ask you a question. If you knew your parents would accept you, would you then want to transition (even if rn you don't really feel the need to)?
From what you're saying, it sounds like the idea of being trans and living as the gender you'd prefer to is a very scary idea due to the concept of social rejection and oppression. This is continued repression, and I am so so sorry you're living in a place where you have to be afraid. Being scared of what could happen if you transitioned, especially rejection, does not make you any less trans.

Also, it sounds like you do have dysphoria, and your mental state is numbing it. However, it's important to know that no dysphoria ≠ not trans. There is no dysphoria requirement to be trans.

Edit: comment posted weird so I had to add back the text before the does not equal sign.
For years I supemmressed my feelings and it turned me into a person who wasn't nice. There's always the possibility you might of just noot be anymore, but that rare if not ever happens I think you've gone numb to all your disphiria which in some ways is good but long term its not good
I've had to hide being trans for over 20 years. I'm still trans and since I don't live with my parents,I can now transition. I suggest moving in with ppl or family members that actually accept you.
same
I have suffered and broken myself for a new life and home where I can be myself where I can just be a transwoman some of us have to walk through tar even after you've given up, but im am comfortable and taking being a girl at my own pace if you want a certain life make it happen when it feels right and you're ready some people suddenly are trans in their 80s when they've had time to do soul searching. take everything at your own pace do what you know is best and whats right for you listen to your gut whatever it is you don't have to be trans if you don't want to if you want to be trans do it when life allows you to and it is right for you.
I’ve tried repressing for years. Believe me, those feelings always come back.
When you are able to leave, find q place that's more accepting. And then continue to try and see how you feel then
I’m sure most of us here can relate: I don’t want to lose the people I love by living a life I don’t think they would approve of.
Sorry girl but that is not living at all. Only you know best how to truly be happy, and maybe you can make it work. But remember: you deserve to be happy, you deserve to be authentic. You live in this world with everyone else. I can’t help but think folks like us are here to love ourselves so we can teach others, cisgender, transgender, non binary-to love themselves too. You deserve love. Accept yourself and the right people will accept you. The wrong people will see themselves out.
I repressed it because of conservative family members for decades and it still burst out. Up to you to deal with it now or deal with it later.
It doesn’t really sound like you’ve come to peace with being cis, moreso that you’re very scared of the dangerous and repercussions of coming out. When I was at my worst, I would not have said I was as dysphoric as I used to be either- I was so depressed that I was unhappy with absolutely everything I was basically numb to it. But when I came out, and later got on HRT, the relief was immediate.
Personally, I thought my parents would disown me or quietly hate me forever. My dad ended up coming around pretty quick and my mom still just avoids saying my name pronouns as much as possible, never the correct ones.

All in all though, I know they both love me and support me a lot, and I'm closer with my dad now then I ever was. The extended family I was terrified of as well, but after a well written letter from my dad, they've all come around and most have been very accepting which is a shock coming from people who talk about what happened on tucker Carlson last night. 

I hope your family is as close and loving as mine was. If they really believe in family, they will learn to love you again, but it may still be a shock. Good luck!
I afraid that transition is not something you can logic yourself out of unfortunately.  I know because what you have just said is exactly how I was during my teenage and well into my early adulthood.  Sure I was putting on a brave face and had a ‘life’ but that was me surviving, not living.  I was nervous constantly and never felt like I was part of the moment even with behavior that I thought was appropriate around my religious and conservative family/friends, so I wasn’t even getting a good interpersonally experience with anyone.  

Ever since coming out and transitioning, I have absolutely found that while I get odd looks and the occasional demeaning remark, my capacity for patience and tolerance of that kind of ignorance has only expanded.  I am far more calm than I was and 1000% happier as a result ☺️☺️.

I’m sorry that you have to go through this but you are not alone, having a found family is better than the real thing imo simply cause you can choose them.  GL and I hope you make the decision that puts your mental health first.
So many great responses. I didn’t read them all and maybe this was already brought up. I’ve noticed quite a few of these types of posts. OPs seem to think they have to jump ship from one gender to the next, like over night. That’s just not the case. You can absolutely BEGIN your gender journey. There are many ways you can do that, you don’t need me to point them all about. Thing is, you don’t have to make some big announcement to your whole family. You can just start “drifting” further to the fem side. People see what they wanna see. Peoples memory adjust on a daily basis, they won’t even register your changes. Like for a long long time. You could go quite far before questions arise, and by then, many folx in your life will be “used to the way you are”. No big reveal or shock.
Sounds like ur repressing it :(( plus u can be trans without experiencing dysphoria
As someone who felt that way all thru highschool,  there is a good chance if you stop suppressing it the feelings will come back sadly. Or who knows maybe it is gone. Or I know some gender fluid people fluctuate really inconsistently and can spend years feeling one way only for it to change. Plus you don't need dysphoria to be trans and dysphoria can change with time. Sit and think about what gender you really are and ignore the changing dysohoria.
I think a good way of understanding better your feelings can be imagining an alternative world where you could choose your physical appearance, your gender, your sex. Disconnect just for a bit from reality. Do not think about your family, situation or anything, just think; what would you like the most?
Well it is possible that you just aren’t trans but to me it sounds like your convincing yourself that due to outside pressures you shouldn’t be who you want and then finding things that you wouldn’t see in the “typical” or “average” but do see with you as justification towards that repression of who you might be. Now I don’t know you and I’m not you so I can’t say for sure, but, just keep your mind open. If may turn out ghat your not trans And hey that’s fine. But hey once your situation improves and there is not as much repression in your life you may find out you are trans and that’s great too! Hope you figure yourself out! <3
I had a similar thing happen to me, I think for my own survival I instinctually pushed it down. When I finally began transition and started actively trying to appear masculine and didn't quite look as I wanted to it began to flood back. I had to sort of pace myself. I was trying out trans tape and I couldn't get it quite right; it took five attempts on separate occasions to finally get the results I wanted. That first attempt however, I was hit like a truck by my dysphoria. I'm so glad I had my support system with me because it sent me into a panicky anxiety spiral.

It was like I stood on ice and suddenly the surface cracked and for the first time in a long time I was forced to look at the infinite dark water of repressed pain frozen beneath me for over ten years. I was suddenly that terrified lonely girl on the bus heading home from high school all over again. It was overwhelming but also reassuring. I had had my own doubts up until then because I had shoved that pain and dysphoria down so it was numb but, not anymore. That sharp reminder solidified for me that I am trans, that this is real, and I am finally going to be whole.
1. dysphoria is NOT necessary to be trans. believing it is is a very trans-medicalist idea. pretty terf territory. 

2. people will accept you. putting your projection into others who would absolutely accept you isn’t fair to them as people and ally’s. i would 100% accept you if you came out. use correct pronouns and name. 

3. “man up” is very toxic. very misogynistic and also suppressive of mens emotions and pushes that men shouldn’t have feelings, much less express them. 

i know you’re hurting. i know how it feels to live in a place where you’re not accepted. i moved away from that place but had to move back. my direct family isn’t conservative per sé but the town i live in is. i know your fears. if you can hold on until you move out, i would do that and then immediately seek therapy to start undoing the trauma you faced and learn to be yourself through and through.
It will continue to eat away at you until you are no longer capable of finding joy in life. You have chosen death.

This is a must read for you:

https://twitter.com/nightlingbug/status/1215716433210105856?s=21&t=BfQbPuISjEt3PkvH-jCNEg
Are you living at their place? Are you financially independent? 

If not start trying to get out.,

If you are you can try things you want like dresses in the comfortable of your own home. See how you feel.
Hun I went through the same thing with my family and only years later in my late 20's did I come out and my family said they were shocked and struggled to except me and I mean they definitely aren't as close to me as they were and don't speak to me as often or even about the same things but slowly over time they have excepted me for who I am and believe me it's better to be your true self because you will find that people can tell that you're not being honest with yourself, that can and often does manifest in some pretty fucked up ways. The best thing to do is to just tell them there will of course be initial upset but they will still love you even if they don't agree with you and freak out at first. Being transgender isn't a choice we make it's a fundamental part of out being. I tried to convince myself for many years to just ""man up"" and without realising it I became self-destructive and a complete nightmare. After years of therapy to try to work through all my self hatred and terrible behaviour it boils down to me not being honest with myself about who I am and how I feel and excepting myself you have no idea how far I went to try to convince myself and others that I was this ""fictional character"" that was such a manly and tough gentleman with machismo coming out of every pore and it was fiscally causing my extreme depression my self-destructive behaviours my inability to make a honest connection with anyone my trust issues my crippling anxiety etc... So believe me when I say this , don't try to fool yourself because you will only end up becoming a fool with no happenes and you'll just be getting more hurt then you ever needed too so just be honest with them and with yourself and save yourself a whole lot of heartache and pain. I'll never get the years back that I lost denying who I am, don't make the same mistake I did ""it's not worth it"".  

There will never be a right time. Just do it .

Everything will never be perfect all at once. It takes time.

Don't do it for other people do it for Yourself because no one else is going to do it for you. 

Believe in yourself and your own ability to survive in this word.
This is like exactly what i said when i was 18 and then 3 years later i was starting hormones. Like i literally remember telling my therapist that bc my attempt to transition was so poorly received i told my therapist, ""i'd never really be able to transition"" and ""no one would ever think of me as a woman."" So we just all chalked it up to a phase. 

But eventually, for me, the dysphoria got much worse over time and i realized i was lying to myself. 

That being said, it is possible that it was just a ""phase,"" but i would say go to a gender affirming therapist and talk to them about your feelings. 

Watch out for self destructive negative coping mechanisms like substance abuse and self harm.
That seems like you need to figure this out with a good therapist
So I have dealt with this for many years myself! I had told myself that I wasn’t trans, held everything in, even got married and have a child, divorced, then ended up with another woman still presenting as a cis man all because my family and childhood friends would disown me because of it and I have lived in fear because of how things in this country have been. Finally I decided I just can’t do it anymore, not being my true self has been killing me slowly! I’ve been on hormones for almost 4 months, bought almost a $1000 in clothes, scheduled laser hair removal and cool sculpting to get to where I feel more comfortable in my body. I haven’t felt this good in my life and look forward to getting to the point of presenting as my true self daily!
Yeahhhh I tried the whole ""maybe if I try living my adult life as I was assigned it won't be so bad!""

Flash forward a decade... Yeah you get the picture for this anecdote. I can so relate to the poster's struggle, though at the time my awareness was much dimmer. 

Everyone has their own path, but repression to mold to the expectations of others is never the answer, either for yourself or for sustainability.
Agreed, ur reasoning don’t come from a place of peace réflexion. You will burst out, in 10 month, 10 year but no doubt about it. Now just think about if u’re ok to loose time to ´try’ to be cis longer. It’s valid to do so. But be honest with urself for ur sake
I repressed for decades. It kept getting worse until I couldn't anymore.
This was obvious from the first sentence.

So yeah, what that person said. Its certainly possible to realise that you are in fact cis. But this is not remotely plausible based on your description.
This. I'm currently trying do the same thing (with a conservative family being one of the biggest reasons as well). It's not good to do but can feel like your only option sometimes
Same here. You can’t feel like shit specifically about your gender presentation when you already feel like shit about everything
Yea, the downside however is a lack of emotional response. My dysphoria shot way up but it's calmed down with time and support. Now I don't have massive dysphoria or a had time feeling emotions. Also I've been hella confident and I've made more friends than ever so with my overthinking brain I say it's totes worth
I think you're right about most things but should I still keep repressing then? cause even if I did decide to be myself and my family finds out life will be hell. I still care about them even if they'd hate me for being trans, they are my family after all and they are genuinely the only people I have. I pretty much lost all my friends ever since I moved last year.
God I wish we as a community could see lack of dysphoria as a good thing. Like we’re making people feel insecure about their identity just because they…feel ok about their bodies?
Definitely a thing. I disassociated everything and lived in a black hole for like 27 years.
>If you could live anywhere you wanted, with any friend group, and access to proper medical care, what would you do then?

I would transition without doubt.
What exactly do you mean by disassociation and why do you think I'm disassociating?

I've heard people talk about it I just never fully understood it.

&#x200B;

>But if your parents are the reason why you feel that way, and you are suffering because you have to “live as a man” as you’ve indicated… then it doesn’t really sound like dysphoria is gone, does it?

Yeah true but it does feel like it has lessened due to the whole situation I am in.
I came out to one of my friends and he said that his ""uncle"" was like this, she dressed up privately but presented as a man in day to day life. I'm from Nepal and she needed to do that for safety and societal inclusion but he expects me to do the same. 
I told him it was either living my truth or not living at all. He seemed pretty shaken, haha


It can be different for everyone but the main thing is, what do you prioritize? Acceptance from all and constantly living in the matrix or freedom with a little bit of adventure and risks.
Ugh :(
There’s a difference between being in the closet and repressing. Only you can decide when/if you want to come out, but trying to repress your true feelings is extremely unhealthy. I am however not a therapist and I suggest you get (a trans friendly) one.
Repressing and dissociating was not healthy for me for sure. I should have just sought safety in the closet while I needed to. Refusing to see it or feel it left a lot of crap to undo and sort out.

It also put me in situations where if I had not been lying to myself I could have had important discussions about it prior to things like getting married.

It seems like a great many that do shut their trans identity out of their mind eventually have dysphoria break through and force the issue at some point later in life.
I'm in a very similar boat. I love my family and I honestly don't think i could handle losing them. They're genuinely good, kind, and loving people. The only major downside is they're conservative and not accepting of the LGBT. They don't hate on it or go bully gays on the street, they're not like that. They're the kind to say they love the people but don't approve of their life style. When i talk to people about not transitioning yet because I'm not ready to lose them, they hardly understand.

I know my family would probably cut me off if i came out of pay for me to conversion therapy or something, even though I'm in college already. People tell to just be myself and it doesn't matter if my family loves me or not but that's not true. It matters to me. It matters so much to me. My family is my entire world. The reason i live, the happiness I've had, the memories I've made. I feel like I'll never be able to fully transition because of it though. I'm socially transitioned here at my college 4 hours away from home, but I'm scared I'll never be able to fully transition. It's not a simple choice for me and people don't seem to understand that. It feels like either way I'll end up miserable.
AMEN
Same. I disassociated for most of my life and it felt like I was buried alive in a mausoleum with only a tiny little slit to look out of and watch the world going by, knowing that I would never be seen, heard, loved, or even known as a blip in the universe. That pain was so awful for 30 years that finally my mind broke (because egg cracking is too cute for what happened when I finally came out to myself and decided that I had to transition to survive), and if I believed in god I’d pray so hard that no one ever had to live that way again. Even if you lose people, what you gain on the other side is so worth it. I’m no therapist (but I go to a very good one), but I would suggest that repression is only going to result in lots of agony until, if you’re like me with “life threatening dysphoria”, the decision is finally death or transition. It’s not worth the pain or the regrets that you never did it sooner. Best of luck finding your way 💗🥰
Well then I think that’s proof enough. I’m so sorry that you’re in a place that is making it so hard to accept yourself. Focus on the good things, the things you like about yourself, the little things you can do to affirm yourself. I believe you, and I believe in you.
Disassociation is a psychological process where in order to endure pain our brains learn to ignore it so we can keep functioning.

Like, if somebody punched you in the face every day, eventually you might psychologically stop caring in order to cope, and say things like “getting punched in the face doesn’t really bother me.”  You might feel emotionally numb, or you might start to view your experiences with detachment like they were happening to somebody else, or you might go into denial.  

It still ends up hurting you.  It’s like you’ve locked your feelings or pain in a box and thrown away the key.  They are still there, they still happen, but they are so bottled up you can no longer access them.

I don’t know that this is what is happening to you.  Maybe the dysphoria really did go away.  Only you can figure that out, ultimately.

I feel like this is what's been going on with me for the past years. I just ignored what I really wanted in life and started seeing my biggest problems as non problems over time since it was basically an impossible for me to be myself in my situation. It reached the point where I tried to make myself completely forget about the whole trans thing. I refused to visit places like this subreddit because I just felt like it would help me if I forget about the whole thing and that it would make me any less sad but it didnt work.
Yeah.  That definitely sounds like disassociation.  It can help you cope in a temporary situation, but You end up paying for it later.

I’m sorry this is happening to you.  I’m sorry you have to repress yourself to stay safe.  You aren’t the only one.  And a lot of us do get out eventually.  It’s just hard.  Really hard.
Thanks. and yeah thankfully it's a temporary situation. I was going to move out in a few years anyways after which I'll be myself and if an opportunity presents to move out earlier, like for example me getting a boyfriend or girlfriend that allows me to move in with them I could do the same thing.
I’m glad to hear that.  Do whatever you need to do to get through that.  Don’t lose yourself in the process though, ok?
>Don’t lose yourself in the process though, ok?

But I think I lost myself already. It's like I'm always looking at everything though a thick mist. it all doesn't matter to me or get to me. I just feel nothing but numbness.
:( yup.  That’s disassociation.  But at least you know what it is.  If you can name a problem, you can deal with the problem.

Are there things you can do to reconnect with yourself?  

Here’s an example.  When I get dissociative, I put on some emotionally resonant music and try to pull the emotions out.  Not venting per se.  I get to a safe place, dig up the pain and *feel* it.  I cry, I sing, I scream, I laugh maniacally, I break down into a terrified shivering mess, I break sticks or other objects I don’t mind breaking.  I don’t per se recommend you do this… this is what I need in particular and it can sometimes destabilize me or I can lash out and hurt somebody if I don’t have the proper safeguards.  But it provides some temporary relief.  I allow myself to feel the things I was not allowing myself to feel in a safe environment."	tt7qxc	trans	443	0.99	2022-03-31 19:35:35
No makeup, no shame, no balls! Orchi complete! Feel free to ask questions!		"Huggles everyone!  A rare no makeup look of me!  You can see my beard shadow, undereyes, uneven skin.  Just all the things we as woman try our best to hide!

But my Orchi is complete!  And I'll happily answer any questions people have!

Personally I had my Orchi done in North Carolina at the Duke Ambulatory Surgery Center by Dr. Charles Douglas Scales.  I would like to say Dr. Scales and the staff were OUTSTANDING.  They were so kind and respectful of me, and clearly enjoyed my bubbly energy and giggles about how nervous I was.  They also just did an outstanding job, even considering my terrible motion sickness (which apparently greatly increases your chances of getting sick).  They gave me oral motion sickness medication, and then using my IV to administer HEAVY anti nausea medication.

Laying down they gave me IV relaxers before ever getting to my actual anesthesia!    Directly after my surgery I was SOOOO disoriented, chatting and loopy.  But I was also crazy happy.  I could feel the monster nuggets were gone and it was now much more comfortable under my leggings!  

---

Some more thoughts in my experience.  After getting home I was able to take a look at the aftermath.  I kind of want to post pictures as I haven't seen many postpone orchi pictures.  But I currently have a huge purple incision when they opened me up and stretched me out.  I am bonkers bruised down there and look like a wreck 😅 My surgeon apparently does a very good job at getting all up inside you to pull cut and suture the cords as possible.  

So far recovery is expected.  Low pain, lots of sleeping, fairly loopy.  I am a bit more battle worn than I expected and have been keeping everything iced lots with the ice bag they gave me sitting over a wad of gauze.  But overall I feel very complete.  I always dreamed as a kid if getting rid of my evil dragon balls that were responsible for cursing me into a male body.  And now that it's down it's so surreal knowing they can't haunt me any longer.  Huggles everyone 💓💕💖
They do blow them off with a comically large amount of TNT, right?
If you don't have balls, where does the pee get stored??
That's fricken awesome! Kong 🦍 rats 🐀!
You have the best smile 🤗
Got your orchi, nice, that takes balls for sure. OkI'llseemyselfout
Congratulations 🎉
You look so happy!
Congratulations! What made you decide to get the orchi? Or, phrased differently, what made you choose orchi over other surgeries?
Congratulations girl, you look beautiful and really happy. I want to get my orchiectomy as soon as possible but I’m so averse to the gatekeeping process. It’s possible that I would never get to know how it feels to be rid of my testicles. They have helped to mutilate me for life with male characteristics and mostly irreversible, like huge shoulders, MPB, etc. I’m in awe of you and your look of total serenity. I wish you a speedy recovery and a full return to your life and of course with the benefit of  -NO MORE TESTOSTERONE - yay! 🥰
So happy for you!
You looks great!
How long for recovery, at home, come back to the job...?
I really want this done, did you have to wait a year? I think I read something about a WPATH requirement of a year on HRT
It REALLY looks like it lmao.  Doesn't help their case with when you read the medical description of the removal.   Some kind of mosquito type of removal with bludgeoning to get more cord followed with severing and cauterization and suturing them 😆
Lol 🤣. If all our pee was stored in our balls we'd all have crazy water balloons hanging off us!   Would put a whole new meaning to when someone was kicked there!
I was soooo buzzed from my surgery medication I didn't realize what you meant until now!    Lol cute animal communication ☺️ 💕
I was trying 😆  I was soooo buzzed from the surgery medication I couldn't make heads or tails out of the faces I was making!  I couldn't feel a thing and was on cloud nine even though I looked like a trainwreck
Lol thank you for the giggles 😜 💗
<distributes huggles>
Thanks I am very happy!  Definitely in some pain today.  I can't imagine how much of a screaming princess I would be after a full GRS!  Sigh some people are wimps and I am one of them!
Thanks!  I hear you on all those feelings!  Honestly the serenity I had after surgery was surreal.  I was high as kite from the anesthesia medicine and couldn't feels thing except the bliss of my body being mine finally.  And that thing that tried to destroy my life was gone.  It was also such a strange experience at the surgery center too. As all of these people were genuinely happy to help me, make sure I was comfortable and felt safe.  They were happy to be doing there job that day and part of their job was helping this lady get her balls lopped off 😂. It was such a weirdly affirming moment as a trans woman.  I know I'll look back on that day with. Smile 😁 💗
😁💗
No heavy lifting for two weeks.  Specifically I am not allowed to pickup anything heavier than a gallon of milk!
Yes typically your insurance or your surgeon will require you to wait one year before allowing you to have them removed.  They may request you have a therapist thumbs up as well.   In my case by 1.5 years HRT I was obviously a happy vibrant woman with no question if who I am.   So I met with my surgeon.  He had no concerns about my transition and was confident I was ready
Going full mad scientist down there🤣
That's great haha. I'm sorry for the confusion but enjoy your drugs and hopefully you recover quickly
On a more serious note, I plan on getting vaginoplasty eventually but do you think I should get orchi in the meantime or just wait it out so I don't have to save for two surgeries?
That's often the case with most surgeries. Do you know the reason for this one? What's the risk?
Okay, I have only been on HRT for 82 days but I know I want it done. My next doctor appointment isn't until November unfortunately
There are upsides and downsides.  Getting one at a time means you may get a better orchi with nice cauterization and suturing of th remaining viens. Snd the recovery of having your balls removed becomes separate from vaginoplasty.  Also separate your vaginoplasty will take less time or allow the surgeon more time to do a fantastic job.   But it will cost more separate. Last most people can get an orchi much sooner which can help early transition with hormone levels and body fat distribution.

Both together is cheaper overall.  And you vaginoplasty surgeon won't have an extra scar to deal with from your orchi.  Also together you may have more tissue, since an orchi can result in your scrotum shrinking some. These reasons alone are often good enough to just wait for vaginoplasty.   

In my case I am fine now.  I don't mind having a bad dragon 🐉 down there.  I might get a zero depth vaginoplasty latter, but I can relax now and take my time in that decision
Specifically with an Orchi the testes have a very healthy strong blood supply.  So when they remove the testes they have to sew off the blood supply.  This means the biggest risk of an orchiectomy is hematoma (or bleeding into the scrotum).  You can reduce this risk with bed rest the first few days, slowly working back into your normal walking and house routine during the the first week.  And not lifting anything heavier than 10 pounds in the first two weeks.  This can greatly reduce the risk of breaking an internal stitch on the testicular artery.
Thanks! 

Unrelated to that first question - but do you find that sleeping is easier now without the ol' hamon clackers flopping in all sorts of stupid ways?
I am amazed at how much more comfortable it is down there.  I lay down and there isn't all this extra heat and sweat down there.  If I turn over on my side nothing sandwiches weirdly between my legs.  When I pull on panties its sooooo comfortable, same with leggings and jeggings.  Even just sitting at my desk and crossing my legs is so wonderfully natural now

I literally will be telling my surgeon that I want to hug him on my follow-up.  I always knew this was right for a dozen different reasons, but now I'm coming up with a hundred different reasons its extra awesome!
Did you get the scrote yeeted, too? That's always the part I'm curious about for this one. Most people don't (for potential future reasons, good to have that tissue there). So I wonder if you have it, does that affect you much if at all? How do you deal with it if so?
I did not, but mine is really small and very sensitive.  And its getting smaller every week now that my tiny testes aren't stretching it out.  Mine *might* get used for a zero/shallow vaginoplasty in the future.  But for now its just a sensitive part of my body that lightly dangles below.  So there isn't really anything to deal with, its roughly the same size as a regular woman's labia lips.
huh. That's good to know!"	xcjlj2	trans	331	0.98	2022-09-12 17:59:05
Why does nobody talk about this dude? The first FTM to go surgery?	"So for context: I'm FTM myself, and I just came across a post about this dude - Karl M. Baer. 

He was German and transitioned in 1904!!!!

I feel like us transmasc people fall through the cracks, everyone knows the Danish girl, but it seems like no one cares about trans men history.... 

When I was just coming out, the only trans guy I heard of was Brandon Teena from Boys Don't Cry, and I went right back to the closet, because I was so scared of having the same fate. 

Meanwhile, this dude transioned and lived happily (all is relative) all the way back in 1904, just a shame that it's not more well-known...

[https://letherfly.org/en/karl-m-baer-the-first-person-in-the-world-to-undergo-sex-change-surgery/](https://letherfly.org/en/karl-m-baer-the-first-person-in-the-world-to-undergo-sex-change-surgery/)"	"Karl also published a semi-autobiographical novel, *Aus eines Mannes Mädchenjahren (Memoirs of a Man's Maiden Years)* in 1907, and it was [**translated into English in 2009**](https://www.amazon.com/Memoirs-Mans-Maiden-Years-Body/dp/0812220617)!

He wrote the book together with Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, who was one of the first doctors to offer something resembling modern western transition-related medical care. In 1919 Dr. Hirschfeld opened the *Institut für Sexualwissenschaft* in Berlin, which among many other things had a dedicated clinic providing early forms of transition-related care.
Not only was he trans, he was intersex, a feminist, at a point a lesbain, and polyamours. He should really be talked about more especially to lgbtq+ kids, or really just new lgbtq people
So much trans history was lost when the Nazis burned books and attempted to erase us
Yay, some Karl Baer love!! Thanks for making this post.

My personal favorite historical trans man is [Dr. Alan Hart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_L._Hart). In 1917, he was one of the first trans men to undergo a hysterectomy in the U.S., and:

> The 1906–1907 case of Karl M. Baer had set a new precedent for sex reassignment surgery by enlisting simultaneous support from psychiatric, legal, and surgical quarters. There was now medical and legal precedent for transitioning; Hart's approach to his own transition appears to have drawn on the Baer case.
Thank you for posting this. <3
This guy is super cool too, he was the first to undergo phalloplasty and the performed SRS on the first British trans girl to recieve it.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dillon
There was also Dr James Barry who was English doctor who helped pioneer the c-section as well as reaching the rank of Inspector General in the British Army
Ohh I love history like this, thank you for this post!
He was in my presentation for my research paper! Very cool guy!
Maybe the facts not many know is wjy he lived a happy life, just a thought tho
And sadly much of the history Dr. Hirschfeld researched and collected, and the advancements made by him and the Institut, were destroyed when the Nazis burned it to the ground and forced him into exile.
Wow that is so cool! I’m totally reading up on this guy. Not only is it trans history, but I rarely hear of polyamorous people like me from this time.
Literally one of most heartbreaking things I've read about. What world might we be living in if the Institut survived to the 21st century?
Very much agreed.

We would know so much more of our history, our presence throughout history. Medical treatment and surgical treatment for those of us who need or want it would be so much more advanced."	wlta9o	trans	317	0.99	2022-08-11 14:50:44
Yooooo, ya all won't belive what just happened to me! Even I still hardly belive it! Don't give up!	"So I woke up today to what I thought was going to be another shitty day in this shitty world (we all have such days don't we?) my parents didn't talk with me for a few days since I came out to them and tried to talk with them about my problems, even when I passed my IT exams two days ago they didn't call after they ended to check on me or congratulate me or smth as they always did, all communication I had with them was at most ""go do that"" or ""I don't feel like talking today"" for the last few days.

So to the point I woke up today, while taking a shower at about 6 am I started to cry under the shower instead of going out to school for like 30 minutes I was just sitting there, cuddling myself like a turtle, which is why I was late for my train and I knew at that moment that I will make it to school only for two out of five lessons (my school is about 60 km away so an hour ride by train) but still I decided that fuck it (my frequency in school is shit) it can't get worse than that, and so I embarked on my journey...

School went well, I talked with my best friend vented a bit and calmed down and just when I wanted to head straight to my comeback train i received a message from my father, he said that he send me (calling me by my CHOSEN NAME like WTF) some money so I can spend it on myself to feel better, he said that I can't talk about it with my mother as she is still in denial and is partly blaming herself for me being trans and that he will work it out with her while helping me to figure out my problems.

And so with a new life energy a bit cheered up and with hope that everything will sort itself out I went shopping, I checked male part of the shop first as I was still a bit ashamed and I was looking for some gender neutral clothes but to my avail I couldn't find anything good, and so just as I was about to leave i said to myself (yet again) ""fuck it let's roll with it I have only one life and it's time I live it as my true self"" and so I went on to browse in women's section, with a bit of shame and with my voice cracking one time I asked shop personel for help, and after a little friendly chat that sweet girl figured it out (I'm probably not the first closeted lgbt person in her career) and asked me which pronouns I prefer if she may ask, she then called me by she/her, helped me with sizes, styles, said some things about different materials and so on, she was so helpful and kind and understanding!

It was my first time shopping as a girl and in girls portion of the store and it was so good! Even tho I felf a bit uncertain at first it felt both amazing and just right at the end! 

TL:DR - After another shitty morning I was accepted by my father, went shopping as a girl for girl clothes and I can ride on that high for a month now!  NEVER GIVE UP AND GIVE IT YOUR ALL LIFE CAN BE BEAUTIFUL"	"Baby trans steps 🥰
Good for you! This was awesome to read. Thanks for sharing!!! 💙💖💙
Another moment of the gender euphoria that cis people can never know. 

I’m so happy for you! 🤗🤗🤗
I'm happy that there are parents who accept their children... Wish mine could...
Your dad is an absolute Chad
A really important day I'm happy for you. Remember this.
Hey, I'm really proud of you. That first store experience is really hard, I had mine recently too.

I've only gone the once but I have a feeling it's gonna be easier every time :) i hope you're proud of yourself too!!

I felt dreadful just circling the store, pretending like I don't know which section I want to be in lol
I'm glad that your dad's warming up to you and offering some support!  ☺️🤜🤛😉
This was almost believable except the bit about having a ""friend"" lmao
I came out to my parents last weekend. This resulted in a massive amount of gaslighting and them saying some horribly transphobic things to me resulting in a screamfest. I sent them an email that night about how horrible the things they told me were and how they really did hurt because I knew they would read an email from start to finish and I would be able to better word it that way.

&#x200B;

We talked on the phone the next day. They still tried to defend their position in a couple cases but did apologize for the way they acted and treated me. However, they also told me, at 21 years old, that I am on the Autism spectrum. The fact that it took me coming out to them for them to tell me this hurt because they betrayed my trust because this would have helped me a lot with dealing with issues such as emotional control and conversational skills that I was often told off for as a kid and have spent my whole life to this point learning to deal with on my own (they really thought they would never have to tell me because I have dealt with these so well that I literally pass as a neurotypical adult. I'm a junior year college student living on my own now on the other end of the country and I'm able to care for myself no problem, have a good social life, and I'm acing my engineering degree). 

&#x200B;

Since then (this was Monday), I've had extremely little contact with them. I honestly wanted space to deal with this and planned on ignoring phone calls until they at least came around on their feelings towards me. But they have been talking with me pretty minimally. My mom tried to call me once, she asked me if I was ok, I said I wasn't doing well but I loved her and got no response from there. My dad sent me new longboard wheels and bearings, something he was going to get me before I came out. I sent him an email simply thanking him and got no response from there. He didn't try to make it feel like a pity gift and I honestly don't think that was the intention, but it does indicate that at least they are not upset with me anymore.

&#x200B;

So I'm crossing my fingers to have this scenario happen to me. I texted my little brother to see if they were ok and talking about me at all. They seem to be just fine and have not been discussing me at home. I truly hope they are ultimately reflecting on both the fact that they really hurt me with the transphobic things they said as well as just how horrible and damaging it was to me to deny that I was on the spectrum until I was an adult and keep that information from me. It might be wishful thinking but I'm not ruling it out because despite all of this I know deep down my parents do love and care about me more than anything in the world and that that love does trump the narcissism that might exist at the surface. I have faith in my parents to make a change because I know under that surface they are good people and are strong enough to do it. I honestly do love you mom and dad and I hope this ends in a way that makes us a happier, healthier family by finally putting many issues that we've ignored and denied for way too long to rest. And even if I decide not to transition, I think coming out to them may be the best thing to ever happen for all of us.
I love this! I'm proud of you for being strong in the face of difficult conditions and I'm happy you're starting to get the support you deserve! Your mom will come around but like everything in life it's a process. It's not always easy for us to accept ourselves either. Big hugs!
Even tho they are just baby steps they are still a few steps forward in the right direction, towards a better future! ❤️
Yeah, I said he is my best friend because he is my ONLY friend lol, but beggars can't be choosers I guess
And your stride will get longer as you go! 💃
Oof, this hits home, I've got no friends, my local trans support group has been ignoring me since last year even after countless emails, and I'm on the stage on hrt wear cuddles and stuff are amazing now lol, I joined taimi out of curiosity and it's been funny actually being able to talk to people about stuff, like I met a cute trans girl (unfortunately she lives 600km away) and it was fun talking about hrt stuff, giving advice and just finding that you have changed from being a toxic unlikable ass into a wholesome girl that loves life now and won't flirt but listen and yeah. I need friends lol

Just a thought: if you want to be stealth, be stealth.	"The tiktok algorithm has been showing me a lot of content lately from fellow trans about how if you’re stealth (if you pass and choose not to be out of the closet) then it’s some kind of internalized transphobia unless you don’t have the privilege to do so. I think the idea is “why wouldn’t you want to be trans unless you’re a hater?” Or maybe its more like having a responsibility to educate. 

I live in a progressive community. I could get away with being out. But I don’t want to. I would rather people think I am a cis man. If me and some very progressive men are having a conversation about wieners, i am damn well going to pretend i have one. 

One tiktoker said people who are stealth are censoring/somehow harming their culture.  But i don’t see being trans as my identity and feel uncomfortable when my gender is a big deal, even when its positive attention. I don’t think that makes me transphobic. But idk, change my mind.

Edit: Loving all the experiences of enjoying and embracing transition in the comments. I wanted to add a note to this post validating those who are out. But I don’t think those who want to keep it to themselves should be shamed. That’s what I was trying to get at. I am stealth because it feels good to me, not because I think everyone should be stealth."	"I am openly trans online in most places but I am stealth at work and only my manager (because of a IT mishap and my birth certificate not being changed yet) and another trans girl at work know I'm trans
it’s no one’s business but your own, you are not obligated to be out to anybody.
Being trans sucks because everyone expects you to say your trans.

Literally nobody cares if I like to work instead of play videogames. Nobody asked so why should I feel the need to tell anyone. 

Again it’s just a statement that you really don’t need to tell anyone ever.
Tik Tok to be blunt is shit.  Like if you said that on any reddit thread you would be called insane for trying to invalidate someone's goals and dreams.  Especially trying to call that transphobic like wtf.

Tiktokers just don't seem to have the ability to hear from others if their opinion is sound and it just lets them spout whatever and think they are right.  Hate that sort of stuff.
I don't like being trans at all. I don't find pleasure in knowing that my assignment at birth is different than my brain's. I don't think I could feel proud of being trans like other people can. And that's okay. 

I don't refer myself as a trans woman except in strictly online LGBT spaces. 

In real life, I am ordinary woman. Just a regular Jill going through her life normally. Sure, I have some hormone problems, but that's fine. 

My identity is that I'm a woman. That's it. I'm not comfortable with another label attached.
I’m stealth. It’s not my job nor my responsibility to educate others. It’s not my responsibility to give up any safety I have just to make others feel seen and normalized. I worked my ass off to be able to blend in well enough with women’s society and culture so that I wouldn’t get clocked. Why would I work so hard at doing that just to not? And why is it okay to ask me to not? I don’t owe disclosure to anyone. Least of all disclosure to people who might wish me harm, because other trans people who have chosen not to live like me think I should.
I don’t understand why we cant be stealth and in the community. If anything, cis people (and those passing as such) are critical to advocating for trans people. By being stealth, we can enter conversations with other men (speaking from my pov here) and stand up for trans rights. It works. People listen more to people they share commonalities with. Then they can focus on the conversation about trans ppl as a whole, instead of YOU being trans.
I lived totally stealth for about 13 years before I rejoined the community (now I am mostly stealth still). There is nothing wrong with that lifestyle (in my opinion), but you should try to be aware of your motivation. I think it is easy to be running away from your gender or problems or history. It is also easy to find yourself isolated.
Nope, nothing to change your mind on here imo. If someone can be stealth, and chooses to be stealth, that's their own business and no-one else's. Nothing transphobic about it, it's not censorship, or culture harming, or anything like that. It's just more culture/identity politics which 90% of people think is pointless, stupid, or both. 


>I think the idea is “why wouldn’t you want to be trans unless you’re a hater?”

Who the fuck would want to be trans? It's fucking awful. Being trans is honestly one of the worst experiences of my life.

Edit: removing the last part of my sentence, because people don't agree, and I want to remove it as a result.
I wish I could go stealth one day... it's one of my primary end goals of transitioning (if not *the* endgoal). I don't want to deal with transphobia if I don't have to. Besides, if I can't go stealth at some point, what even is the point? I just want to be treated as a normal woman, I want to blend in, I just want to be normal in society's eyes...
honestly being stealth is the dream for me. I still love being part of the community and interacting with other trans ppl but omg having to address the fact that im trans in every interaction is exhausting
I still feel like I don't pass when I look at myself, but I haven't been clocked or gotten any weird stares in public in a long time. My identity is woman first, lesbian second, trans third. It's absolutely true that being trans has shaped my life in a very deep way, but the longer I spend just living as my true self, the less important it seems. I'm open about being trans with friends and family, but for clients and anyone else I interact with on a daily basis, I'm just some lady. 

I do want to make the point that I'm not ashamed of being trans at all, I'm forever grateful that I was actually able to transition. It's just not central to who I am as a person these days.
It’s up to each person to choose for themselves. Not going to knock it. I will say though as a black and specifically Ghanaian trans woman raised in the US. Being trans and out is kind of tied to my career goal, I’m aspiring to be a adolescent and young adult aged therapist who centers BIPOC, the lgbtq+ community and neurodivergent folx and I especially want to provide representation because i don’t really personally know any out African trans women in the states and few have an online presence. I need my siblings to know that they’re valid and if I go stealth once I am able to pass… it would be doing them a disservice personally. But like i said earlier, it’s everyone’s choice how they want to live
Social media hot takes lol
TikTok really isn't that great. I wouldn't take anything people say on it that seriously.
I’ve personally been shamed and ostracized by some of my local “community” because I won’t be a saber rattler and fight the pronoun wars. Two things about that. 

1) I didn’t do this to start, or be a part of a revolution. I did this because I always hated what I was born and the parts that came with it. So I solved the problem and went back to living life

2) you can please all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you will never please all the people all the time. Someone is always going to have a problem with you or what you do no matter how hard you try, so stop trying so hard. 

There are a number of us that just want to live life, and are lucky enough to be able to do it under the bigot radar. Shaming us for not being out and proud is not making any friends and with the political climate out there right now, friends is what we need.

Live and let live people!
Being stealth can also be safer, fwiw.
""Why wouldn't you want to be trans unless you're a hater"" idk maybe because I want to just be a lady and not have the mountains of asterisks, baggage, and literal life-threatening danger that comes with being a trans lady.
I don't specify that I'm trans when meeting new people usually, I don't see a reason why... I don't even pass that well, but usually I pass enough that the first impression most people have is that I'm a girl

I had a week with a few people I'll never see again(most of them). Did they know I'm Trans? Apart from 2 who knew me before, I don't think so

I was just one of the girls there, it felt so good and nice

I'm not ashamed of being trans, but I don't want to risk it and worry about it all the time 

* could also be more of them knew and were just that nice that they didn't mention it, or they only suspected... Anyway me being trans only came once when I was alone with someone I knew from before (who gendered me correctly when I wasn't passing at all without me saying anything! No idea how she knew but she somehow did)
I am fully out everywhere as my true self proud trans girl sadly i am the only trans at my work place we got 2 gays tho but they had to change a few things when I came out at work xx
Yeah like, I can be stealth and still be supportive to other trans people. Life for me is just going to be far more difficult due to my career path in the trades within a pretty conservative province where I live if I'm openly trans. I am privileged by a long shot, but I really just wanna live my life as a normal guy where people treat me like a regular guy. It doesn't mean I'll disappear from the trans community. I'm still trans. I'm just not open about it because it could be potentially disheartening or even dangerous.
For me, I mostly try to go to “stealth” because I just want to live my life as a woman. I would rather not have a daily conversation about my existence as a trans woman. But this choice to go “stealth” does not mean that I don’t advocate for our community: I fly the pride flag everywhere; I challenge prejudice when I see it; at uni I wear a lanyard saying “LGBTQ+ ally”; in discussions on trans rights and diversity and inclusion my trans identity is nearly always brought up.
honestly yeah. people fixate on relative privelege when the only thing it takes to strip a stealth girl of that is being outed. if your relative privelege can't withstand a scooby doo reveal it's probably not worth all the discourse
I think every trans person should have the choice of how they manage their transition, because ultimately being trans isn't about fitting a mold other trans people built, it's about being yourself authentically, including the approach to transitioning.
It sounds like they heard “you don’t need to pass in order to be valid” and took it to the extreme.
People on tiktok should chill the fuck out. Yes being trans is a beautiful thing, but being out as trans has heavy social consequences.
Being out or not is a personal choice and that should not be used against people who don't chose to
I wanna be stealth until passing(ish) but I wonder if hrt tiddys will make it impossible to stealth
Well, stealth is the goal, isn't it? Otherwise, why ask people if you pass? ""Pass"" = blend in with the crowd. I would love to go to one of those parties where there seems to be an infinite number of people and the only one you know is the person who invited you. Then end up in a group discussion about superhero movies or something similar, where all the girls drift off shaking their heads leaving me to soak up all the bro energy of debates over who would win in a fight between Thor and the Hulk.
Personally I identify as a man. Not a trans man. 
Despite being pre everything and I couldn't ""pass"" to save my life, that is how I identify and when I transition I will be and will act like a man.
Being trans isn't important to me. Getting to live my life as it was supposed to be, is.
I understand why people want to be identified as trans and those people are super important for us, for our future, and definitely shouldn't be discouraged in any way. They bring much needed attention to the issues we face. But that doesn't mean that those of us who are stealth don't help out or contribute. We just don't do it as loudly. It doesn't make us less important. 
Every one of us is important and valid no matter how ""loud"" we choose to be about it. So, people, you do you!
Yes. It’s quite simple. Just want to be a woman
Yeah and sometimes we don’t feel safe being out. It’s our choice to be stealth or not. I admire people that can be openly out but I don’t think that life is for me, a shy person that hates confrontation haha
I'm stealth and I like it that way. I don't want to be treated differently or having people asking me uncomfortable questions about me being a trans man. And I feel safer not disclosing that I'm trans.

People should just let others choose if they want to be stealth or not and honestly it's kinda of a privilege to be openly trans and feeling safe about it.
Its more like for me some days I put in effort and others I don’t the people who I stay friends with vibe it. But sometimes I go AGAB as like a precaution to scary new places.
I agree with this sentiment. If I had the choice, I’d rather not tell people and have them just see me as a TRANS man. I’d feel like the fact that I’m trans would become TOO MUCH of a defining part of who I am. I’d want to be seen as more than that by anyone.
Yeah, as much pain as life has given us, we are happy we are trans.  This is who we are, and we embrace it, and if we could magically be cis, we would say no.  

We go stealth when necessary.  It's honestly fine now, it's like being a spy in Mission Impossible.  It's just a part to play, no different than when we play a part on film or on stage.  

When we get to be our authentic self, we revel in it.
tik tok opinions generally don't mirror the way of the real world.
The beauty of choice. 

I’m so sorry about the birth certificate mishap!
Yeah! Totally! People listen to me a bit more when i’m engaging in the activism part of being trans when I do so as an ally. Fucked up but true.
Personally? Being trans brought nothing but grief, yeah. This is going to make me look bad to the commenter who suggested that sometimes being stealth can mean running from your gender panic. But ever since I came out ALL i’ve wanted was to be a normal dude. It was the point of transitioning, for me. To each their own, of course, but i cut my papa milkers off so people WOULDN’T know they used to be there.
Agreed One-Million percent.
>I'm sorry but anyone who says otherwise is a liar.

No, that's just your pain speaking.

I wouldn't be cis if you paid me. My experience isn't universal of course, and nor is it even an experience that everyone ""should"" have. It's just *an* experience of being trans. But it's an experience that doesn't involve hating myself for who I am. That is something that is possible to get to.
As much pain as it has caused us, we wouldn't trade it for the world.  We would not become cis even if the Gods said we could be, and we will die on that hill.
Biiiiiiiiiiiig same. Granted at my height it'll never happen, so the best I can hope for is to give legit confusion.
Right! Like I don’t ignore trans people at all and certainly do my part. I present as a strong ally. Instead of a transman.
Reading that, this honestly may be my bias. That now that my transition is pretty much complete and I have been trans for a long time, it is just not as important to me anymore.

Another commenter brought up the jealousy and pain that can come with struggling to pass and i thought this was a very insightful comment. I remember what that was like and wonder of I would have thought differently about my own post back then.
Oh my gosh, what an amazing aspiration. You have goals that are dedicated to helping others. Therapy is no joke of a career. 

If I felt like being out would have a broader influence, like if i were a celebrity, i would probably want to show that trans people can be successful and seen. It would be a different story. But i do not think anyone will be paying attention to me like that any time soon.
Exactly how I feel! :)
Exactly. I’d rather present as an ally than a trans person.
I like “scooby doo reveal”
I entirely agree and love this comment. Because I definitely take part in pro-trans activism! I speak up! But as an ally.
Hmm. So, by “we”, you mean the tiktokers i was talking about who think that being stealth is transphobic, right? 

Because I’m trans, and I don’t want to share it. You see it as an identity. I see it as a private quality.
Speak for yourself. You might find comfort in your trans identity and that’s fine. But some of us don’t. Some of us *want* to be seen as cis and blend in with our gender. Some of us see “trans” as our medical condition, not our identity. It’s how we’re dealing with a body mismatch. If I could magically become a cis male, I’d do it. I’d do ritual sacrifices if I had to.
Yeah IT set up my certificates in my deadname and not my chosen name which was on my accounts so nothing was working on the computer which I needed my manager to help me get fixed
Same. There’s a lot of good work to be done. Same thing with womens rights. Men speaking up for them is what’s necessary for real action to happen unfortunately. I think there’s a time and place to be out, but being stealth has a ton of sway.
Transitioning can be excellent after the fact, and we should all seek to be positive role models for others, but doing that shouldn't make us unhappy or uncomfortable. If you're going to be upset by telling people your story or explaining your situation/transition/journey, then don't do it.


>This is going to make me look bad to the commenter who suggested that sometimes being stealth can mean running from your gender panic.

I disagree with them, but honestly, I also think that's nobody's business but the person choosing to be stealth. The same way that how you transition is a personal decision, how you choose to tell your history is also one. 


>But ever since I came out ALL i’ve wanted was to be a normal dude. It was the point of transitioning, for me.

Everyone I know who has transitioned, and everyone I know (me included) who hasn't yet, only wants to be viewed as their gender. They don't want to be viewed as a transman or woman, and honestly the more I've thought about this, the more I think the stance that you can't be stealth is actually transphobic. What they're basically saying is ""you're not an X, you're a trans-X"", and how is that any different to saying ""you're not a real X, you're a Y"".
Yeah, you're right, and I'm sorry, so I've edited it out. For all my talk about things being individual, and how those tiktokers are wrong for saying everyone has to be overt, I've then immediately ignored that and said everyone should be a certain way.
I’m so glad you don’t hate who you are!
Who is we? I'm trans and would give almost anything to be cis, and my friends are the same, so it's certainly not a universal experience.
I would dash like, hella infants on the rocks for the chance to be cis, sis
Lol I would. No offense, but being trans isn't really great for me at all. For example, my biggest concern is that I could be discriminated at work if I'm not careful with who I disclose it to. Being trans has brought me so much pain. Yes, I have had great bittersweet experiences including some amazing relationships I have built, but now looking forward, being trans is a huge obstacle that I may need to keep a secret, so I will at the very least be treated fairly. If I was told by a God that I can wake up cis in the morning, I would take that offer.
Thank you. Yeah I’ve wanted to be a therapist from a young age. Like i distinctly remember telling my aunt who passed away years ago that i wanted to become a psychologist at age 4 or 5 so i could help people. She was accepting of the lgbtq community and i think she knew i was probably queer (she was accepting of the community and never policed my gender expression or teased me) and mentioned that i would probably have to work with gay people. At the time i was scared of that (grew up very religious bc my parents are very involved in the Christian church - well my mom still is anyways and dad used to be but anyways) now like 20+ years later I’m like YES that’s the goal lmaooo
With you seeing it as a private quality, do you go to Pride or any similar LGBTQ events? Or do you just stick to what would be the social norm for your gender? No hatred, just curious
We use ""we"" because we have DID.  We are many voices in one brain, so we use we.   

That's valid how you want to live your life, and so is how we do it.  Yesterday I went out in color coordinated trans pride clothing to go shopping at the mall. 🤷‍♀️
If you reread what we wrote, we *were* speaking for ourself.  We didn't say you have to feel the way we do.  Peace.
YEAH! This reply rules. Thanks Orange
By far the best explanation of my experience. Agreed entirely on the last paragraph.
>Everyone I know who has transitioned, and everyone I know (me included) who hasn't yet, only wants to be viewed as their gender.

I'm 6 years transitioned, and cis passing these days. I am openly trans at every level of my life, because I don't want to be viewed as cis. I don't want people to assume that I'm cis. I don't want the fact that I'm trans to be the first and main lens through which they view me, and being cis passing absolutely helps with that, but I also don't want to be viewed through a cis lens either, because my trans identity is important to me. It's part of who I am.
It's not, but there are lots of transfolk who are fine with who they are.  They don't talk about it so much because of being dogpiled on by people who do not like being trans.

We say we because we are a system of alters.   We are many whonact as one.
BAHAHAHA
It has been very painful for us as well, but we wouldn't change who we are for the world.
Oh i totally go to pride! I vote for pro trans policy, i work to make spaces inclusive for trans people (like, I made a big fuss over a trans 12 year old being able to stay in the cabin of their choice at a summer camp i work at. I think this was a pretty big deal for him.) Yeah, supporting people is a responsibility for everyone. Just, while I do this, people think I am an ally instead.
So I went to look at your profile. The issue seems to be that you're using a quite uncommon pronoun, ""we"". It makes it seem like you're speaking for multiple people other than you, and not just yourself.
Hey, I'm sorry if that part of my comment felt dismissive. It wasn't meant to be, what I meant was that in my experience, and my friends' experiences, being trans isn't something we want to be. If others want to be trans, and visibly so, that's absolutely fine, that's a personal choice. What I take issue with is the idea that you *have* to be trans, as a trans person, you can never just be your gender, which is what the op is referencing.
And that’s awesome!

Let’s not downplay the folks who love that as part of their identity. Let’s absolutely not downplay the folks with a beautiful and fulfilling transition. But i feel the opposite way, and its not coming from a place of pain. Its just not me. Just like the old pronoun. I think these two experiences should be on the same level.
As I said elsewhere, your personal circumstances weren't clear, so your comment came across as your speaking on behalf of the community.
Some people are like you yeah! But quite a bit of trans people would change it. You also have to remember, some people have it extremely rough. Instead of saying ""we"" regarding every trans person, instead say ""a lot of us"" or something like that.
So what I’m getting is you present socially as a cis strong ally? That makes more sense. Initially I thought you meant like stereotypical straight cis life since you pass. Thanks for the work you do!
Ah, yes, that.  We are a system of alters, so we use we because we are many and one.  It confuses some people, but all the people with DID (of which there are a lot in the trans community) recognize it.  So it's bith to express who we are, and also to signal to other people who are systems.
I didn't find your comment dismissive at all! I was just offering a different perspective
Sorry, that was a response to a specific part of the post I was replying to. I've edited the quote in to make that clearer.

What I was trying to say is simply that there are trans people out there who don't simply want to be viewed as cis folk of our gender. Not that everyone should want that, just that there are people out there like that
Yes, we understand.  We'll just have to be more clear that we are speaking as a system, not for other people.
We say we because we are a system of alters (you know, DID).  We understand that is apparently confusing tonsome, but it is nonetheless how we talk about ourselves.
Oh I'm sorry! I should have looked at your account beforehand! Apologies for the mixup.
It's okay!  No worried at all!"	zoumr1	trans	276	0.98	2022-12-18 09:21:01
"This isn't a good sub for ""Do I pass?"" related posts. Almost everyone here will just tell you what you want to hear."	"Like I said. Everyone here (almost) will lie straight to your face. 

I've seen people with DD's and a very feminine figure say ""First time in a tux do I pass??"" and everyone is like yes. No, you don't pass. Which isn't a bad thing but when people give examples about what you could do to pass better they are ridiculed and shamed for pointing things out. I'm not sticking up for things like saying someone's eyes are too feminine, but rather than saying if you're asking if you pass or you should be ready to tell the truth that you deserve. If you want to hear you look a certain way then ask for it. Don't have people lie to your face, you deserve better.

If you're posting a ""Do I pass?"" post we can assume your goal is to pass. Telling you the truth about how you look isn't meant to induce dysphoria but to tell you why you aren't passing."	"I feel like trans people in generally are the worst to ask about passing because they either compliment you no matter what or nitpick and notice every little thing that they notice on themselves while most cis people will gender you correctly and not even think twice about. I had trans women say to each other that they don't pass because of visible collar bones. COLLAR BONES. Nobody else would put that into consideration, it's just second-hand dysphoria verbalized.
This is why r/transpassing exists.
Thank you for this post. I’m all for trans positivity, but this sub is not going to give anyone anything but the warm fuzzy responses we want to hear.  
  
It’s a good sub, but it’s a very soft sub.
I try to be nice and give somebody the truth but all I do is get down voted to hell for it lol you can’t tell people what they need to hear onlyy what they want to
I'll admit, I avoid replying when people don't pass because I don't want to hurt anyone, which just adds to the problem.
I feel bad for young and some pre-T trans men who post asking it here because they very very rarely pass but everyone is telling them they do instead of saying things like ""Hey maybe don't wear mascara and blush in pictures asking if you pass,"" or ""No you're holding yourself in a very feminine way and your features are small and the combination of everything about how you present yourself is still overtly based in a feminine perspective.""

When people try to actually tell them that at best they look like 12 year old boys, they get downvoted and buried and criticized. How do people not understand that you're setting these poor men up for even worse dysphoria and bad vibes when they go out in public like that and get misgendered and treated like they're ""just a tomboy"" or some shit. It's not helpful.
I wouldn’t call it lying, most people here probably don’t even know their perception and judgment of what passes is skewed. 

Of course we will have a more lenient view of gender presentation and expression here as we’re all affected ourselves and will tell someone who’s halfway there they’ve done it, whereas cis people who don’t know a lot about passing will absolutely clock them. 

Tldr: don’t ask trans people if you pass, don’t even ask allies or people you know if you pass. Ask a total stranger, they don’t have any pre-existing opinions of you and will more likely get an honest answer
Here's the truth, and it's one people aren't going to like. You want to know if you pass? You really want the reality if you ""pass"" or not? Go outside. Go shopping at a department store, walk up to the clerk, and see which dressing rooms they point you toward.  That's the test. 
When interacting with strangers do they call you Sir or Mam? That's the test.

A single picture, with filters and good lighting isn't reality. Interacting with strangers who are just meeting, that's the test,  because that's what it means to really ""pass""
I feel the same way I try to actually be honest when I answer I know that may not be what people want to hear but I would rather be honest and try to give them some constructive criticism because the world will not care about your feelings I mean entire purpose of asking if you pass is if you would pass 2 everyone else that doesn't know
Thank god someone finally said it. “Passing” doesnt have to be the ultimate goal in transitioning. It’d be nice to pass, sure, but for many people (myself included) it’s just not realistic.
I don’t want to post online to get that kind of feedback.
1. I don’t want my photos online except in very controlled ways.
2. Lots of people like sharing support no matter what (which can be good)
3. Some trans people are very harsh and will identify more traits that could raise suspicion, but are also seen in some cis women.
4. Dysphoria and intense scrutiny can drive us to be harsh to ourselves and others.
5. Some people post pictures looking to validate their fears and insecurity
6. I would not be surprised if cis pictures sometimes get posted as experiments.
7. Still pictures of faces only show so much. Different angles, lighting, and so many other things in-person may raise suspicion
8. I’m pretty sure I read as a trans woman, but my appearance and dress are enough for most people to get the hint on how I want to be treated. That is a good place for me.
Not only that but you could argue the concept of passing or “looking like x gender” is deeply flawed and problematic
The only way they’ll learn is getting clowned in real life. It’s unfortunate but true. People can’t take criticisms or L’s. Always been that way. Just got to stand back and watch them get hit by the vicissitudes of life. Not much you can do if people don’t want to hear honest critique.
I made a post asking if i passed for some reassurance, i know i pass pretty well, it's just that i needed to hear it from other people, but i do get where you're coming from, it would make me feel horrible to tell someone that they don't pass, and a lot of the time if you don't pass, people will just tell you that you pass no matter what, it isn't an accurate.
I'd usually try and be honest on those types of posts. Sometimes you'll get down voted but it's better that the person knows and can try and solve that.
You can be honest and not rude. I try to be as helpful as I can but I don't think it is received very well overall.
I just personally think that there's no such thing as ""passing"" as this will always depend on other people and outside factors. There's absolutely no norm on what people should look like to qualify as any gender. There are very masculine looking cis women and very feminine looking cis men and everything in between.  Men and women come in all sizes and shapes. Plus how others perceive you isn't actually only a matter of what you look like, but also about how secure you are about yourself, the mannerisms etc.
[deleted]
Why's that a bad thing? Sometimes people just need reassurances, not to be nitpicked and have all their perceived flaws pointed out and told why they don't pass. This is what I mean when I say the idea of passing is toxic. It leads to us focusing on tearing each other down for not being the epitome of our genders
thats why if i ever make that kind of post i will not specify what gender i identify as, just ask what gender people think i am
I like my collarbone... I think it's very feminine
Women have collar bones, though. Lol what -
[deleted]
This is SO REAL. It’s why the highest form of passing is passing as cis to other trans people. We know where all of the seams are and how to find them. I feel like Torrey Peters said something similar in Detransition, Baby.  
  
We see all of our worst fears about ourselves in other trans people, because it reminds us that we are what we are.
[removed]
Aren’t most of us very soft subs?
Honestly this is my least favorite trans sub...
I made a post saying my goal isn’t to pass, but to look like me. I think it got like 20 upvotes lol
I've found the opposite to be honest.im pre-hrt, From my experience going in public and on dating sites especially, the only people who clocked me...were other trans people. A few CIS women I spoke to would be like ""ooh, I see it now"" if I explained my situation, but generally, cis people don't know all these signs and traits we do.
Yeah, in a perfect world.. but it’s also a safety issue in this one, and that is pretty invalidating to binary trans folks
Its only problematic if you or others make it that way. Even if it was completely safe for me to not pass and the gendered expectations were removed, I'd still want to look a certain way to be comfortable FOR MYSELF.
Yeah! My goal isn’t to pass it’s to be me
This
Why is it problematic? I thought we would all be happier if we were born with the body parts we wanted in the first place. I would rather have a flat chest than these hideous things on my body. If I pass as someone who is hard to tell if they are a binary male or female, I would love that. I don't want to fit into any category. And if I get to have that and it makes me happy, don't see a problem.
Then why even post “do I pass?” If you are not prepared to hear the truth?
places like r/freecompliments are there for that
I think it looks very graceful on women. Dysphoria is not necessarily a reflection of reality, our brains can be very mean.
Exactly. But obviously if it makes you feel dysphoric then you're gonna point it out as soon as you know someone is trans.
i think they meant broad shoulders which is usually a cis male feature because of high testosterone.
Yep. But dysphoria isn't rational.
Isn't being honest about passing or not the important thing?
Which is necessary
Thats... The point...?
That is kinda the point. Do you want validating lies or hard truth?
Nice
Touché! Personally, I’m like a VW Beetle - a soft top. Im a rare bird 😂
Hmmm  
That's interesting  


Maybe it's because we're more sensitive to the tells so to say  
Or maybe it's also a little culturally influenced  


Kinda wanna do a study on that now and find out what influences someones judgement and honesty when rating passing ... I wonder if my institute would green light a study like that
But you wouldn’t be trying to “pass” you would just be trying to look a certain way
THIS

I'm mtf, I dont look like a woman and dont want to, be trans for me means to be free
I’m glad some other people get it!
You’re misunderstanding. Wanting to change your appearance or body isn’t the same as passing. Passing implies certain genders must look a certain way to be recognized as valid. A woman or man should be able to look like anything. That doesn’t invalidate your specific personal changes of course.

[removed]
Oof. That's just sad. But I understand that, I suppose. I think my baby cheeks are feminine. I also don't paint my nails sometimes even though I like doing it. It is all internalised feelings of dysphoria and I hate it. We need to be kinder to ourselves.
I don’t know. it’s necessary to be blunt and honest, but that honesty should come from a place of compassion. i’ve seen a lot of people there that give feedback in a way that just feels like bullying and I don’t think that’s as constructive
Oh I love Beetles!  
Always wanted one, but they're so hard to find and I somehow always end up with a SUBaru ... wait I'm a lesbian of course I end up with a Subaru 🤔
I'd be trying to look the way a typical female in my family does, because that feels natural and comfortable to me.
Yep
I wish I could just like shake people and make them realize this
That's exactly what passing is though. Wanting to change your appearance. I bind my chest to pass as a guy sometimes. I would like to pass. And yes, a man or a woman should be able to look like anything in an ideal world but that's not how the world works. Everybody views genders in binary and gender expression as a strict adherence to rules, so, we are stuck adhering to them to alleviate our dysphoria.
Like bruh you are literally asking if you pass and get upset when people answer truthfully. That’s like ordering a sandwich and getting upset that you didn’t get a hamburger. You get what you ask for
That’s doing more harm than good and if you’re asking if you pass, I’m always going to answer honestly (not harshly but I will point out why you do or do not pass).

If you’re looking to feel better about yourself r/freecompliments exists.
Oh yeah! I was just saying that if you’re specifically looking for compliments that there’s a place that’s good for that too
Why would anyone want to hear that they pass when they don't? I don't want to be an asshole but, don't we all want honesty? I would rather be given tips and tricks to pass better than just straight up compliments. Infact people should stop asking ""do I pass?"" And just ask ""how can I pass better?"" That would take the pressure of people who are commenting as well. If you really just want validation, people surely can be upfront about it. If I 
ask ""do I pass?"", am I supposed to just expect lies?
Yea, that sucks. Haven't been over there so haven't seen the full extent of it. Just talking about people being honest and just saying that people dont pass.
Exactly my point, everyone there straight up calls people ugly and like ""stop trying"", ""you look like a straight up man"" instead of giving constructive feedback like ""you should work on this"", ""maybe try this with your makeup?""
Alas, we’re a rare breed - those Subarus make up the bulk of our side of the trans spectrum, but we exist!  I mean, I don’t know any of them, but we’re out there. Or I’m just the last unicorn and I don’t know it. 😂
  
However yes, as a lesbian I can say the allure of the Subaru is impossible to ignore!
And that’s valid
Passing is not “wanting to change your appearance “. Passing is “Do i look like X gender?” And then altering your appearance if you think you don’t . There’s a huge difference.
I'm not asking anyone anything. I think asking the internet if you pass is fairly pointless for the same reasons you pointed out here. Yet, here I am apparently upsetting multiple people. I don't have a horse in this fight, bruh.
[deleted]
For sure, I agree that people on this sub really do need to be more honest about this stuff. Having a positive space where people are nice to each other is good, but it’s gotta also be constructive
You are contradicting yourself. 

How would you identify as part of a gender identity? By looking like them? By acting like them? By altering your appearance like them? How is that different from wanting to change one's appearance to fit into a gender group? I don't see the difference. 

Aren't we all wanting to not be seen as a trans person? I mean, I don't hate being trans but I would love to be cis and not have dysphoria.
Then maybe don’t ask if you pass and rather say something along the lines of “been feeling down lately. Could really use some compliments.”

In fact you see a lot of posts like these on trans subs and if you title your post like that, I won’t point out if you pass or not however otherwise I will give you what you ask for
Being blunt just means the truth. Which is what asking a question typically seeks
I mean passing is more than just purely a safety thing. I don’t pass, I know I don’t pass but I still keep going and semi-presenting. I still want to pass though and it’s not upholding social norms for me to want to look a certain way. 

I do agree people should be nicer when responding with tips and not just tearing into someone though. It’s just asking if you pass is almost useless because you either get a fake yes or a nitpick that really just doesn’t matter. It would probably be better if people stoped using online to ask about passing because none of the information is ever really good. 

If you just want a compliment just post “do I look pretty” or “do I look handsome”
Sounds like you have an extremely binary view of gender. Nonbinary people, a lot of the time for example, will ***always*** be seen as trans people depending on their expression. You're misunderstanding Arcana completely. They're saying that gender shouldn't have those stereotypes or expectations to begin with, and they're right.
I feel sucidal sometimes knowing I won’t pass personally. So it’s not that I meant it isn’t important in that way. But I don’t think I’m explaining well. 

Anyway, it’s clear no one agrees with me. I just like to be nice, and find many here way too blunt. 

But maybe that’s just me being pathetic. Everyone here seems to be able to take harsh truths.
I don't. That's presumptive. While I wish the stereotypes and expectations didn't exist, they do and that's why gender expression is still mostly stuck to the binary. While trans women should be able to dress masculine if they wish to, they do not ""pass"" or they are told they are not femme enough. If I, as a trans masc person wear a skirt on some days, I get misgendered way too much!!!! Even by the people who know my pronouns. I am not disagreeing with Arcana's pov. I am just saying that we don't live in an ideal world. If we did, we wouldn't have as much social dysphoria as we do now. 

So, as far as this exists, don't think wanting to pass can inherently be problematic. What's problematic essentially would be is toxic masculinity and beauty/fashion/gender expression standards.
Do not say you are pathetic, you like myself may be overly nice to try and cope with our own insecurities about not passing but that does not make us pathetic. Mia speaking is fine and the message you should take away is not that you are bad.
You're literally changing your argument now though.
Where? Quote me.
You literally go from saying that Arcana is contradicting themselves and that every trans person's goal is to pass and then when get pushed back on it claim you're not disagreeing with their pov lmao
""Passing is not “wanting to change your appearance “. Passing is “Do i look like X gender?” And then altering your appearance if you think you don’t.""

This is what they said. And it IS a contradictory statement. I didn't understand what their definition of passing was, going by this statement. 

I also said, if you read my previous comment that ""we don't live in an ideal world"". Dunno where I changed my argument. 🤷 And doesn't every trans person want to pass? Isn't that the whole point? I don't understand. Am I missing something here?

Edit: The pov that I don't disagree with is the stereotyping of gender expression which is inherently wrong. Not ""wanting to pass"", which they claimed is problematic. The root cause is the issue, not the effect. Hope that makes sense.
Wait.. You really don't see the difference?
Nope. Please explain.
When they said ""passing is not ""wanting to change your appearance"", what they mean is that it's not ***just*** that. That's what the quotes indicated. Obviously changing your appearance is part of passing, but that's not what it is in totality the same way racism isn't just ""hate"" it's ""hate against a certain race""
How is racism and passing as a trans person comparable? If someone wants to pass, they do it to feel accepted. Passing is very important for trans folks who want to pass to feel safe, to not be ostracized and to feel accepted. I am not sure how that is problematic. I still don't understand. If you are saying that the society forcing gendered beauty standards on everyone is wrong and that it shouldn't happen, *I agree it shouldn't*. But it is not just a trans people issue. It is a whole issue surrounding beauty standards and culture which unfortunately harms trans people more because it causes us dysphoria when people don't accept us when we don't pass. If a trans person is just sticking to those gendered beauty standards to avoid getting ostracized, I don't understand why THAT is inherently problematic. 

I am non binary and people are still largely stuck with gendered binary beauty standards. I constantly get misgendered and be called by my Agab, which gives me extreme dysphoria and affects my mental health. Although it is not ideal and it would probably take years for this culture to change, I just want people to stop addressing me as my Agab. While gender expression and gender are not equivalent, if dressing as a super masculine person with goals of looking like a cis man would help me look like a male and be addressed as one, I would take it. I would rather be misgendered as anything but my Agab than be misgendered as my Agab. Again, I am not saying this is ideal. Some of us just want to live a peaceful life in this cruel world.
holy shit you're incapable of understanding how ideas relate even if they aren't directly connected. Good luck I guess. It was about explaining how sentence strucutre and logic work
Not everyone has the same capacity to understand. Some people just have differently wired brains. Maybe I am missing something here or maybe you are not good at explaining it or maybe we are just misunderstanding each other. It happens often to me on Reddit and internet spaces. Maybe I am dumb lol. I dunno. But thanks for engaging, I guess."	r8fdpi	trans	247	0.92	2021-12-04 02:28:54
I got ready for college just to learn last minute that my lesson was cancelled. Didn't wanna waste the effort I took doing makeup! (shame I have no fashion sense tho)		"What do You mean no fashion sense? Your outfit looks just as great as You. : D
What? You totally have fashion sense! That zigzag top is cute, and you can never go wrong with black. You look great, just keep being you.
Have more than me lol. Tbh I'm kind of scared of going shopping for clothes, I'm not even sure what I want.
You look amazing!
You look amazing!

I love the zigzag top with the black skirt and cardigan
Awww thanks! <3
I'm really glad the zigzag top is a hit, it was picked out for me by my grandad
From what little experience I have I think not knowing what u want is the best part - u get to try on everything until u find something u like!
""Good people deserve good words"" is what I say. : D
Ah I see, so it was your granddads fashion sense 🤔🤣 it’s awesome either way, and that’s cool he chose it out."	unyqbo	trans	215	0.95	2022-05-12 11:18:45
I really really need help.	"In the car coming home from school my asked how my day was and I said good. That was a lie so I texted her about how how it’s was because of dysphoria, depression, anxiety, and self hate and she came and talked to me and hugged me and talked about how she was sad she couldn’t help me. In response I texted her about how she could actually help by helping me to start HRT or at bare minimum start puberty blockers to give me more time and yadsa yadda. She then decides to come in and tell me that the science behind it is experimental and to stop researching it and that I’m likely to de transition and that this is sudden( I came out 3 months ago and have known for 3 years) and that my brain isn’t developed enough to make that desicion at 14 and that she can’t allow me to not have kids since it’d make me infertile despite the fact I don’t want kids and if I did I’d adopt, and how she thinks I don’t know what I’m feeling and calling me invalid and shit and now I’m a crying ball of self hate and shame because my mom is an anti vaccine Karen that believes in essential oils and shit.
What am I supposed to do."	"It doesn't sound like she's the type to be influenced by evidence, but you could at least try sending her some info/studies about puberty blockers? Beyond that I'm not sure what there really is to do, because someone who refuses to change their mind isn't going to.

I wish I had some magic way to help everyone in your situation... all I can offer is a virtual hug
A karens mind cant be changed,  they are like q qanon nuts, im so sad for you , but unless you plan to leave your parents and tell your parents about a new adress ,you need really close friends, nothing will change
Hi OP. I feel for you deeply. Coming from a narcissistic parented background, I see a lot of things in your post that flags me - the transphobia, denial of evidence as long as it suits her, the invalidation, etc etc etc.   


You're not an extension of her; you're your own human. You aren't questioning, you know who you are. I've learned this the long and very hard, painful way, but when a person loves you, they are capable of accepting truths that are hard for them to swallow.   


That being said, I will agree with only one point your mother made: you are young, and things that will impact your life permanently should be taken with great care. It's true that some people do regret not having children after being sterilized.   


Here's a solution I can offer you. I'm not sure what sex your body is, but you can freeze eggs and sperm, on the off chance in the future you change your mind about kids. HRT is good to start perhaps at the age of 17 or 18, because you're still young enough to make transition, but old enough to really have your priorities straight. HRT requires a change in lifestyle, on a regular basis, that you absolutely must maintain, and that's difficult when you're very young.  


So, offer to freeze your DNA to your mother. If you're comfortable enough with her that you can research the science behind it all, offer to answer any questions she may have about it. (The science has been around for at least a couple decades and it is not at all experimental - it just differs from person to person for their particular needs.) I recommend checking out Stef Sanjati's channel on youtube if you're MtF, and Jammidodger if you're FtM. Both have detailed their experiences in detail. The medical transition is very safe if you're working with reputable doctors.   


Lastly - the invalidation is a big, big no no. You might feel very emotional because that's what teenagers of all types are; it's how they work, but you absolutely know your feelings more than anyone else, and you know yourself more than anyone else. This one was the big red flag for me, and I suggest that you be careful if you don't have a good relationship with your mother. I could go on about this, but I'll leave it at that for now. Please stay safe!
I would educate her on how harmless puberty blockers are. Even if you decided you werent trans, all you have to do is stop taking them and you go through puberty like you would have normally. It either helps your dysphoria, or nothing bad happens. 

Emphasize that they will allow you to have more time and grow before you decide (even if you're already very certain). It's a double win, you wont develop dysphoria inducing sex traits, and your mom wont worry that you're making an irreversible decision before you're ""old enough to decide""
Actually it wont make you infertile if it is Estorgen idk about testosterone. So here's what you can do:

1. Ask you mom or dad, whichever is more likely, if they will take you to see an endocrinologist (hormone doctor). If they say yes, go to the appointment, meet with the doctor, explain to them how you are feeling and then let your parents ask questions. If they allow you to go on hormones and/or blockers, good, immediately have them sign an authorization to continue that treatment with the doctor. IF YOU CAN, stay to talk with the endo in private and let them know whatever worries you have about your home life or question about anything.

If your mom/dad wont accept what they are saying and say you cannot go on hormones, this is where you make the decision between:
   
     a. Under US healthcare standards you are permitted to seek your own treatment IF it involves your mental care, substance abuse, or birth control. It is up to you to seek your care in this case and you may need to pay for your prescription. If you use your parents insurance they will find out. I assume the doc would not tell your parents but you must ask the doc this. Check with your school and see if they can help in any way. or...

2 Keep trying until you convince them or do it when you are 18.

Now as far as finding care goes, search google for transgender center/clinic/institute/organization of the state you live in until you find one that either has a list of trans health care providers or that you can call and ask for providers. If they make you feel uncomfortable in any way it is okay to try someone else. For example, where I live there is a ""transgender center for the rockies"" which has numerous resources for trans people. I just found a new doctor last month by chosing a woman from the list I though I'd like, then I called her care facility and made an appointment. You will have to answer a ton of questions though so be very patient.

All this information should be legally correct, but I highly suggest reading this to make sure I did not miss anything. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008301/
i hope that things will end up better for you
You're 14 and 3 months really isn't a long time for family to get used to it. Maybe they're scared. Mine were like this for three years when I came out at a young age. Overall depending on where you live you can't start E until you're 16/18 and i dunno your situation but you mightve started puberty now so its too late for blockers. Just ease off, let them come round.
Well, your mother is correct, your brain has not fully developed, you do not even have the right to give consent at 14 years of age. Your mother is just trying to help you here, I  have multiple friends that de-transitioned after puberty hit (I'm not saying that you will de transition but it is possible.)
I don’t have anywhere to go and I don’t have any friends
About getting health care myself, how do I do that, I don’t live near public transport, and can’t drive.
Blockers can be started at any point during puberty, not just before puberty
I started blockers at 11, and I’m starting testosterone exactly at my 15th birthday. It’s not impossible, but it is hard to get everyone on board
I'm not everything you need, but I can be friends :D
You will have to call somewhefe first. If you have any LGBT teachers or friends you shoild talk to them. Maybe someone elses parent will take you to your appointment. This is why you should talk to the school if you think they will be accepting. You MIGHT be able to ship your meds to your school after the initial appointment, but I am not sure if the school is not good with LGBT stuff.
Even still, if they have had changes they will not be reversed, and usually around this age you do have changes.
Many many countries don't let people do that, and like you said it is very hard to get people on board.
I know you can help but I have so many friends online but it doesn’t help, I need someone in real life.
Yeah but there's still a lot of changes that can be prevented, especially bone structure changes that happen slowly over the course of puberty
Trust meeee, I know. My best friend is just over a hundred miles away, and I haven't got many others. If you ever need a gal pal, I am... always willing

Struggling with accepting being transgender	"Hi all. I have a confession to make. I made several posts here before, some of which were really popular, but I deleted them all as I get too overwhelmed by being a trans woman to the point that I keep going back into the closet. The thing is that I desperately want to accept myself as a woman, but whenever I do I suddenly feel like I have to do a lot of things right at that very moment to prove that I am who I say that I am. It gives me huge imposter syndrome, and a bit of internalized transphobia to boot, and I don't know how to overcome it. It has gotten so bad that I feel absolute shame for even considering that I am a woman, let alone want transition into the body I so desperately need to have.

I just don't know what to do at this point."	"I had the benefit of talking to a retired trans therapist as a friend.  The most golden advice she gave me, that I waited decades to take, was ""Quit labeling yourself!"" She pushed me to just be me.  Not to be m t f.  Not to be nonbinary.  Not to be any of the likely 100's of labels out there circling around.  It was golden.  I wish I would have taken it earlier.  No impostor syndrome.  No stressing about pronouns.  No thinking I have to dress this way or that.  Whatever is comfortable for me is good.  I finally realized, I needed hormonal change.  That's it.  I don't need dresses, lipstick, eyebrow plucking,  etc...  I prefer women's pants and shorts to men's.  But men's tops to women's.  I look any thing from tomboy to femboy at any moment.  I don't draw attention.  I like that.  Some may love dressing crazy to attract attention, I hope they keep doing so.  We need more happy people in life.  Yet I'm finally both comfortable in my skin and own it.  I'm proud of myself and pretty sure more well adjusted at this point than most CIS folks because my coworkers and boss have both commented ""Nothing ever bothers you, your patient, calm, self assured."" and always with envy in their tone.  The secret.  I so believe in myself, my accomplishments, my direction, so much so in fact, that anyone else trying to insult or convince me otherwise is just wasting their time.  I wish all trans folk could be blessed with the same peace.

Everyone is different.  Why do I think this might help you in particular?  Because your obsessing over the stereotype of what you think your trans is.  You can call yourself a fem and not wear a dress!  Cis girls do it all the time.  You can be dude without a buzz cut and have a pony tail. Listen to your internal feelings and follow them.  If you don't like wearing skirts.  Don't wear them.  If you love wearing them.  Wear them.  Feelings can change too.  You may hate wearing something now because it makes you feel uncomfortable now.  A few years from now you might dance around in joy because of it.  Just be you at the moment and stop pressuring yourself.
I've known that part if imposter syndrome, and I am much more forgiving of myself if I think of myself in terms of becoming rather than just being. You have a lot to work through, and time will help, but feeling like you have to rush now will do the opposite.

You can't start healing if you are too busy being anxious and unforgiving.
About all you can do in life is be who you are. Some people will love you for you. Most will love you for what you can do for them, and some won't like you at all.

I think the problem here is that you care too much about what other people think of you. Why should they get to criticize when they don't get to share your burden? Draw fresh water from your own inner spring so you can walk through this waterless desert called life. Or you can chat with us, we are your oasis.
You don't have to do anything, you are transgender regardless of what you do.  Hell you can just give up and go live a cis life, go full blown guy, and still be transgender.  You are transgender because you are transgender.  All you have to do is make yourself comfortable.  This can mean taking hrt, surgery, affirming clothes, whatever.  Can even do nothing and just accept the realization of who you are also are.  It up to you to make your own happiness.
Yea All I can say is be you don’t worry what other ppl think bout u they not paying your bills or living ur life … just live your life and do what makes u happy
I am totally in the same situation and had a post similar to this yesterday
You can take all the time you need to find yourself. It took me a solid 7 years of going back and forth to finally accept who I am.
Just take it one step at a time.

Start HRT as soon as you want to push that button. It takes a while to work.

You can socially transition when you are ready.

Make a plan. Start Laser hair removal while you are waiting for the HRT to work it's magic.

Everyone feels like an imposter when they start something new. It would be weird if you didn't feel that way.

Check out these subreddits and read as much as you can I hope it helps.

Many trans women will go through a non binary phase. It helps to identify as something with looser presentation expectations as you transition and figure out your identity. You can then transition and when you feel confident and have done more of those things you feel you need to do, you can fully come out as a woman
This is something that someone told me that has helped me a lot:
You don't have to prove anything to anyone. 
You can have a full beard, build massive pecs in the gym, like monster trucks, war movies, and having a beer with the boys and still be a woman.
How you dress and present yourself, how you transition, or even at all, is your choice.
And who you are is who you are, regardless.
What if you just… died tomorrow? 

Seriously. Consider the fragility of life, and ask yourself “what if I died tomorrow - never being my true self?”
Hey dear. I emphasize with you a ton. I’ve been openly my self for only 6 months. There are days where I want all the surgeries and days where I’m totally fine with what I have. I face feelings from internalized transphobia almost daily. It’s been hard, but becoming a women is the only thing in my life that has brought me joy. I find knowing that a lot of the shit that’s in my head is a product of how I was raised and socialized. Knowing that the internalized transphobia and anxiety of being trans in todays world is a product of normative society. Not a reflection of my self. Really helps with  self forgiveness. From there I’ve found most days I can feel stronger and more beautiful. We are badasses living beautiful lives. Hope this helps.
""Woman"" and ""man"" are just idols. While cis imagine themselves to be so much closer to this, trans people shatter this idea by reinventing gender every day. We should collectively embrace the idea that gender labels are just symbolic. A direction where one can never fully arrive, no matter the label given or not given in birth. If cis could let go of this obsession with themselves, we shall know the peace.
Thank you for giving me some advice. I really appreciate it.
Awww. That quote made me tear up in joy. Thank you for sharing it. I really appreciate it.
Thank you for saying that. I never really considered that before, but it makes a whole lot more sense than what I was thinking. It honestly is making me feel a bit more comfortable with myself now that I know this.
You are the only person that you have to live with for the rest of your life. Everyone else comes and goes, everyone. Some stay for shorter bits of time and some stay longer. But you stay for the whole time, may as well be yourself and who you want to be.
Oh cool. What advice were you given that helped you out?
Oh my Lord! You are making me want to cry now because I've been going back and forth on it for almost 10 years and had hated myself for it. I felt absolutely sick over the fact that I struggled so much with my gender identity, even going so far as medically transition for three years only to detransition due to a bad home life and severe imposter syndrome. So hearing you tell me that it took you almost a solid decade to come to terms with being trans has given me the hope and blessing that I will be able to reach my desired life as an out trans woman one day.

Thank you so much for responding to me, sister. I really do appreciate it.
Thank you! I will.
This was a very helpful way of framing this outlook for me, thank you for the perspective 💚💚
I got no answer or advice
That was just the serious contemplation part. When I really thought about it I realized I’ve been doing this my whole life without really understanding it. I simply didn’t know trans was a thing since in the 80s and 90s when I was growing up it simply wasn’t talked about. Then several years of just denying it and trying to be a cis male. When it comes down to it Took me 30 years to accept who I am. I wish it could have been sooner but I’m ok with the fact that I took the time I needed to come to terms with my identity and accept it. You can take the time you need. I’m glad I was able to help😊
Oh ok. I hope you figure things out eventually.
I was watching the advices you get they might help me too
Its so frustrating for a moment to say yes i am a woman im hapoy and them fall back to i m a guy iust be a man i must be tough and you are too girlish for a man, you are weak or other comments the only thing im good at is being with women but lately since i like to be she /her i kinda fall in love with guys that see me as a woman
Neato. I hope they help as much as they are helping me.
Wow. It does indeed sound like we share a lot of the same frustrations. I do hope you can reach a point where you can be happy with yourself regardless of what you identity as. I'm trying to reach for that goal myself."	vvqf7w	trans	170	0.98	2022-07-10 12:26:33
No meds does not mean no trans	"I'm getting tired of seeing invalidation or insults thrown at people in our community about medical transition. Its more infuriating seeing it come from people in the trans community. I (mtf) have been on hormones for some time, they work phenomenal for me. They are a massive double edged sword when it comes to new and intense feelings to process, but I've always been an emotional human so its been great to have that extra level of introspection. I also have trans friends, coworkers, and idols. Among them, some of the most distinguished and beautiful or handsome individuals do not take hormones, and two of the women I'm talking about make me envious and insecure from how beautiful and feminine they are.. without hormones..
Some people literally just cant take them for any number of reasons that dont need to be listed *because they dont freaking matter* and its nobody else's business. If you think you know someones identity better than them, youre wrong. I don't understand how this endemic of trans exclusion has spread through our own community but holy wow the hypocrisy. 

To the people guilty of this: Shame on you. Learn to **support your community.**

To everyone: You are valid in your identity, you are a beautiful person no matter what parts you were given, and no matter what you plan on doing with them. I love you ❤

End rant"	"absolutely true! I’m transmasc non binary and i’m not sure yet if i want to take hormones for the rest of my life or maybe just try them out for a while ( i think thats possible, not sure tho) but as you said, as long as the person is comfortable with their identity, we should refer to them correctly bc we’re all just kind souls trapped in a body that we more or less like or dislike (Your Body does NOT define your Identity!)
Couldn't agree more. 

I do also think that there is some confusion about what transitioning actually means, the different aspects and continual process that literally begins the moment we become aware or cognisant of being trans and is a life long journey that any kind of medical intervention is merely a possible facet of, and not at all necessary (to be trans/ for all), which gets all mixed the complex feelings and internalised transphobia many have, which comes out in ways that some people just don't understand how harmful they are being to others, while just trying to express how they feel.

It's messy and difficult, like so much of all of this is with how hard the world is for us. I'm absolutely not defending or make justifications for the people I describe above, and I am fervently against transmedicalist views to be clear. I just wish there was a simple way to convey to our siblings that their hurt and how society has twisted their perception can also hurt others, and that we all were more readily able to see that in these people and support it (though I absolutely understand that it is a lot and more than a lot of people can handle). I wish there was a simple answer.

Sorry for the long, rambling reply. I just wish we could all support and accept that each of our transness is unique to us and absolutely doesn't need to be measured or come with any expectations or gatekeeping, and everyone, especially our siblings doing this to themselves and others, could just see how unnecessary and harmful it is.

Love and solidarity ❤️🖤
Transmedicalism is so gross.
There are zero rules on how to express or not express being transgender.Thats the only choice.It is not a freaking contest or a race to win.Each journey is as unique as the individual taking it and there is no perverbial yardstick to measure it. Being comfortable in your own skin is the only metric that matters measure that against do no harm take no shit for balance.My feels🤷‍♀️
when i was just a young cis lesbian, i watched a lot of queer creators on youtube. calvin garrah was one of those. now that i’ve grown up me and my friends joke about our favourite transphobic trans person. him. he put out the ideas that every trans person needs to conform to their preferred genders stereotypes. non binary people were bad. if you didn’t ‘make an effort to pass’, meaning not conforming to masculine/feminine stereotypes, then you were a trans trender. he thought that if anyone experience wasn’t the same as his then they were faking. he thought you had to have dysphoria and want to medically transition to be really trans. i’m so glad i actually realised that his views are not just wrong but harmful to the community. so many people like me, and even cis people will be looking for information on trans topics and his videos will show up, enforcing his views even more. i hope all those people finally realise that you need nothing to be trans, other than the mere feeling that you aren’t the gender you were born as. trans guys can be feminin. trans women can be masculine. no kne needs to medically transition if they don’t want to. i’m glad there’s people like you spreading the word, although it does sadden me that people need to be enforced if this.
Yep.

Being trans is separate from medical transition. Medical transition is not available to all, and not desired by all - *and that’s okay*.

There is no requirement for being trans beyond the self-claimed identity. And the requirement for being a decent person is listening to people when they discuss their identity and treating them in accordance.
I would love to start T someday for myself, but right now i just cant afford it as im living paycheck to paycheck and still getting used to living as an adult on my own which isnt cheap at all lol. Just bc i cant afford T or top surgery like i want yet, doesnt make me any less trans and nonbinary. Every person's transition is different and theres no one way u HAVE to do it
I agree wholeheartedly. To each their own and one has no saying on the feelings of others. Your identity is yours and is valid if it makes sense to you and it identifies who you are.

But I have a lingering feeling that this post is related to a (now deleted) post earlier today which gave a wrong idea of this community. Let’s keep us together as we are stronger that way. Let’s keep the peace and love this place is known to be.
Or in my case yes meds no hormones because I'm terrified I won't get hormones because I have mental health issues
Truscum are scum, preach it!
Just remember, if you start testosterone, the changes do not reverse when you come off it. Whatever physical changes happen will be permanent. Not to discourage you. Just so you're informed.
Its such a small portion of trans people who behave like this, but they give cannon fodder to media outlets and internet bigots who represent a much larger demographic.
Thanks for your response. This was shared independently, but Im glad if it is relevant.

This post was not meant to target any r/ communities and was not meant to imply that there is regular toxicity in this or similar subs, or as commonplace in analog (irl) communities. Its just something Ive noticed a lot more from select individuals lately. Its simply meant as a message back to the very few people whos hurtful words are felt far and wide, and a letter of support to those who are affected by these people.  Nothing but love here <3 and Im sorry if I implied it had anything to do with the wonderful people of this subreddit.

Came here because there was nowhere else to go	"I'll admit I'm someone who can be easily shaken, which makes me a target, and I know that Reddit has a rather nasty reputation almost like a bleached version of 4chan, but I have nowhere else to go. Someone accused me of being a ""tucute"" (something I don't believe in, but for the sake of this I'll go along with it) because I'm not radical on my ""rules for trans people"". Because in all honesty, I don't care how others express themselves, it's none of my business and I was raised to be understanding.

I'm FTM and yes I have gotten backlash/threats of violence before but for some reason when other trans people are the ones doing it, it hurts way worse than anything. I'm not a public figure. I'm not an activist. I'm like the least offensive person on earth. I even present as masculine as possible, but it's still not good enough for them. It's never good enough until you want to vomit at the sight of yourself. And honestly, I do, but that shouldn't matter to other trans people online.

I'm sick of having to perform for other more strict trans people, I just want to breathe. I force myself to do everything I can, I work out, I'm searching for a job to fund my own surgery, I stay out of the way, and it's still not enough for them. I've spent so many years hating myself, feeling like I was some kind of sick monster up until I found out about the transgender community at age 11. And I finally felt at home. But even that breath of fresh air is being taken from me.

I know nowadays ""Trans cringe comps"" aren't as popular but I'm still even weary to go outside without the biggest possible coat on even though it's 80 degrees on the coldest day. Because I live in constant shame and hatred. I don't feel guilt, because I know I'm not ""faking"" my feelings. Despite it being expensive I do have a therapist, I do take accountability for the things in my life that don't include me being trans, and I do everything I've been told by professionals. But no, it's never enough.

I'm not taking deals for Disney movies, I'm not getting paid for this, and I don't get ""clout"" for being trans. Someone offered to donate to me and I can't even fucking take it because suddenly I'm no longer ""valid"" enough for any of you?. I don't give a damn about truscum, I don't give a fuck about any of this online bullshit, and I don't have any agenda to push. I'm just some guy. That's all I am. Some random nobody. But no, it's not the active anti-trans laws being put into place, it's not the fault of the people snatching trans kids away from their families, not the ""gay panic"" excuse that makes it fine and dandy to harm people you though ""tricked you"" or the police never doing shit about the lost lives of black trans people. Apparently, it's the fault of other trans people now. Because now you're ""one of the good ones"" you don't need to support your community. Now you pass enough for them so you don't give a fuck about our rights. You sold out, not me.

I get sick and tired of the narrative of transgender men are just ""uwu soft boy"" loving women that are trying to trick gay men somehow. I've had partners, and none of them have ever been disgusted with me or have had a problem with me being trans. I haven't even ever been rejected for being trans, and even if I were in the future I wouldn't give a damn. Because I don't want someone who doesn't love me to date me. That's like the common opinion so I'm not sure where this ""trans people forcing others to date them"" narrative is coming from.

Like I think it's funny how people treat less masculine trans guys like objects of desire to be gocked at and fetishized yet it's my fault for what?, just looking the way I do?. I'm not sure what the fuck it is you want from me but unless you're going to pay for me to be sent out to a camp in the woods where I bang rocks together and eat raw meat naked you're not getting much out of me anytime soon.

I like to work out sometimes, most times I wear attire that might be considered traditionally masculine, and I like to keep my hair cut short (even though lots of cis men have long hair, but let's be honest, you think they care how cis men present?). But sometimes, I like to have fun.

[\(Examples of how this kind of fashion looks\)](https://preview.redd.it/shuwke3kt3e91.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1f7500de765e50f3072a9f5a83b043c45633f1cb)

For some people, the idea that a trans guy could be interested in things like this sounds preposterous. But it doesn't to me, and that's what fucking matters. I'm both transgender and black and so the standards of how I'm allowed to present are narrow as hell. And I just want to express myself. Just one damn moment of peace.

The people in my life accept me, and my boyfriend enjoys my company, I was even starting to feel better since I felt I was getting way closer to my goals for my transition. But my own fucking community can't stand to see my happiness. It's like the second I stopped completely hating myself I'm not good enough for these people anymore.

So basically what I'm saying is, genuinely: What the hell am I supposed to do about like?, like how am I supposed to solve this.

Because it's eating me up inside."	"First off, \*hugs\*.  It has been my experience that there is a subsection of the population who derive their validation through unquestioned conformity of others.  Basically, anything that differs from what they perceive as the ""correct"" way to be is perceived as a direct assault/challenge to them and their belief.  ""live and let live"" does not make sense to them as they cannot get beyond their own insecurity. 

This subsection can be found across all demographics, gatekeeping who is and isn't part of their demographic, as they see it.  Worse is when they get actual power (management, owner, parent, politician, etc.)  

Next, it is a form of selection bias to perceive a whole community as sharing these individual's views.  These individuals vocalize their discomfort, whereas the rest have no real issue so see no need to say anything.  Worse, the ""live and let live"" philosophy discourages even calling out such behavior.  

I do not have a solution to your problem other than to suggest that the scope is smaller than it seems.  I still haven't found a way to ""reach"" such people so that they can understand what they are doing to others.  Empathy seems to be lacking from such people, but that could also be an oversimplification.

I hope things get better for you.
I feel you. The pressure to conform to the gender binary is strong even when you reject the basic rationale behind it. 

You're not obligated to please anyone but yourself. It might take years to fully accept and believe that, especially when everyone around you says otherwise. But with time, it will get easier. In the meantime, take whatever validation you can from trans-accepting spaces. 

I'm new to reddit myself and I know the reputation but there's some good spots here that seem to be reasonably well-moderated.
Unfortunately, there are always toxic people in every community. And I’m so sorry you have to deal with that, but just know that everyone else here supports you and I’m sure you’re so handsome.
Anybody who calls you a ""tucute"" probably isn't worth your time.
It's so annoying that we still have to deal with this BS.  Why can't people just understand that:

1. Other people's transitions are none of your damn business.
2. Rules about what hobbies/clothes/etc. counts as masc & what counts as femme are arbitrary social conventions.  Some men like one or more of the things society has decided are femme.  Some of those men are cis, some of them are trans.

If you're easily bothered by truscum stuff, I'd advise you to just steer clear of the parts of the internet where you're likely to encounter it.  I know that, in principle, silo-ing & information bubbles aren't great, but at some point you have to just prioritize your own mental health & avoid stimuli that are harmful.
I don’t know of anything that I could say to help, except that if you ever need a sympathetic ear, my dms are open.
I’m sorry that you are going through this kinda crap bro. I kinda get it. My interests aren’t super manly, and I’m ok with that. If you like decora kei, do it as much as you want! Be a bright pastel rainbow! F the weirdos who are trying to control your “man experience”. Everyone is different. You are valid.

May I suggest: r/ftmfemininity
I see and know what you're talking about, tho' I have a tendency to keep online communities at a.. idk, mental arm's length?   
I don't want to sound like I'm giving stereotypical platitudes, either; but quite honestly not giving too much a fuck what others think of you is my way of handling these things. It's not easy to do, of course, esp if you need that connection and community bc you don't have it around you IRL. But I know there's people in this world I won't ever get through to, they don't *want* to listen, so I have to just accept that and be done with them, and that part is my descision. There are other communities around, it can just be trial and error to find where it's most comfy for you.  
But like, *you know who you are* better than damn well anyone else. They can't tell you who you are, nor if you're 'enough', nor if you're 'valid'. Please don't allow them to, even if it's just in your own mind. A lot of people project their own shit onto others, and that's not your responsibility to deal with.  
I hope things can get better for you. You don't owe anyone else how you choose to express yourself. Isn't the point of transition to be true to yourself and work for that happiness? I think that's what some hyper critical people miss.
Reddit you can mostly filter out the shit, unlike 4chan. I'm mostly here for cute cat and dog pictures.

To elaborate ones anguishes are naive in the sense that we think they are only our ideas it seems.

God that sucks, if it makes you feel any better I’m ftm and I like decora too.
i do not have the time to read all of this, but from what i’ve gathered: you do not have to conform to whatever “norms” trans people set up. although i am mtf, i’ve suffered from the same problem (although not to this extent) and i think i understand what you’re going through. you need to find people who will support you for who you are. you may never be good enough for the entire trans community and thats ok. keep being you, and find people who will support you for that. if they don’t, they don’t deserve you. stay strong man!!
The biggest issues we as progressives (in general, not just lgbtqi+) is that we can't help from attacking ourselves. It's why we struggle against the conservatives so much because they don't really infight and generally stand unified despite there being many many more of us than them.
Not sure what I could offer other than what I did; drop everyone and focus on you. (And by everyone I dont mean your supportive friends and family). Just... disregard them all. Idk if it's because I'm 33 but something like 10 years ago I decided that no one can be pleased and you're always going to be pissing someone off. I'm trans female, but I don't identify as trans female, I consider myself just a queer girl. My partner is trans male and he openly identifies as trans male. He calls me his wife and I call him my husband. THIS ALONE is enough to piss off like 3 different groups in 3 different letters in the rainbow. I've been hated on for ""perpetuating heteronormativity"" just for not being openly trans and having what looks like a ""straight relationship.""  Or that I'm dismantling queerness by calling my queer partner my husband rather than just the gender neutral ""partner"".

Tbh if I were you, I wouldn't want to be friends with people who are that focused on queer perfectionism. It might feel like you're missing out on some big party or belonging to a community but honestly they are stressing themselves out being so tightly wound about things that can ultimately be deemed redundant. Its crazy because it's been weird to watch the community shift like this, we went from being about love and acceptance to criticizing our own kind for not being (x) enough. 

When you think about it, we are becoming the same thing we fought against in the first place xD. 

""You cant do that! That's for girls!""
""You can't do that! If you do that you're not really a trans guy!'

Both sound literally the same to me. Wtf happened?

This is easier said than done but try to ignore it, focus on the people who support you for who you are entirely.
That sucks. There's a lot of useful advice in here. Whole reading your post I just thought of a study that I read.

It concluded that people who had insufficient care and attention from parental figures in childhood (including me, yay!) will have a higher degree of seeking validation from external sources in adulthood, rather than the healthier alternative, which is internal validation.

Now how to get there, I'm not really sure. Personally I try to accept that my opinion is also that of a person and my opinion of me is valid.
Thank you for understanding and acknowledging where I'm coming from. It's been a long night and I've had to take multiple painkillers to soothe my headache and get to bed. It's nice to have someone really listen. I don't think I'm all that special but I know that there's a chance I'll be put in a trans cringe forum for being soo upset about this. But all I really want is to feel comfortable with myself.
Well said. I'm glad you wrote this out so well.
It just gets soo stressful constantly trying to please people who are purely for binary people only. Some part of me wants to understand why these people feel the way they do, but at this point, it's at the expense of my own self-love and happiness. Like I'm being open-minded but at what cost
Aw, thank you for the support. It's greatly appreciated
What is a “tucute”? I’m not really familiar with the term. From context, it sounds like the opposite of a transmedicalist?
I didn't even think people were still on this, I thought we all left it in 2017
I try to, and I don't actively go looking for it. I have someone who helps me with my transition and such but people online don't know that. They're basically asking me to air out all my personal business regarding all that I'm doing to transition because THEY believe what they've assumed I am in their own minds. None of these people know me and it shouldn't matter to me but it still hurts for some reason.
Thank you
Thank you! I really needed that after yesterday. Really rough on my physche.
Thank you, I'm really trying to stay in the right spaces but it's really hard to stay away from ""those"" places.
I'm mostly here on accident, I was just on Google looking at pride flags for research, and one picture linked to a...let's say, less than pretty, subreddit, I ended up in a very dark rabbithole.
Whenever I meet someone with similar interests, it's a pleasure
It just doesn't make sense to me, there are real threats out there yet people like this only want to find the most nonproblem ""problems"" to blame. It feels like there's nothing I can do to combat this, I grew out of this self-hating phase myself but I'm not equipped to teach others. I'm not a debate guy, I'm an artist. I don't know what they expect from me or people like me.
> From context, it sounds like the opposite of a transmedicalist

You nailed it.
I see ""tucute"" as meant to demonize rational and empathetic trans people for being rational and empathetic towards other trans people.
The only thing you are is ""TooCute"" don't worry about it we love you
Yeah I'm similar, not so much with truscum stuff, more with vanilla transphobia from cis people. I basically don't go near the Opinions section in the Guardian anymore, because even seeing a headline about how my existence is the cause of abortion bans & I'm a rape threat to cis lesbians spoils my mood for the whole day (even without actually reading the article).
One day a few years ago my cousin showed me r/IdiotsInCars and here I am now lol.
Lol, I assumed there _had_ to be more than that. Of course it doesn’t mean anything beyond “you aren’t working hard enough to exclude people from the trans community, and that’s a problem for me!” 🙄

Gender is not actually a social construct. Gender ROLES and EXPECTATIONS are the social construct.	"You can’t CMV. The idea that gender is just a construct is a bit over-perpetuated and not true. I have actually seen this idea maliciously used by transphobes to erase trans and non binary individuals just because it’s inconvenient for them to learn about the world around them that doesn’t fit into their little “neat, orderly box.”

We are worthy of recognition. We have existed for centuries long before a bunch of colonial YTs showed up with their erasure/imperialism and forced their oppressive religion on indigenous societies. Cishets need to stop pretending they all of a sudden want to abolish gender just because the world has diversity they need to accept. You don’t really want to “get rid of labels.” You just don’t want to see us because you’re a phobe.

We need to have what you call “labels” because it gives language to who we are rather than forcing us to be invisible and making us exist under the burden of shame and harm."	"People need to be more clear what they mean when they say it’s a social construct. Transphobes use it to say it’s not real, but something being a social construct doesn’t actually mean it’s not real. To me gender is a social construct the same way race is. There are natural differences, but the way they are labeled and the associations that come with those labels are socially constructed. That also doesn’t mean you should try to get rid of those labels, because that doesn’t really help anyone much if at all
I think this is where we need to understand that a social construct doesn’t mean it isn’t real. I believe gender is a social construct just like biological sex is. It’s a social process based on observations. We (social humans) have deemed what characteristics are worthy of observation, how to categorize them, how to enforce these categories, and the importance these categories carry. Money is also a social construct, but it has a very real impact on our material and immaterial lives, personal well-being, and social organization.
https://youtu.be/koud7hgGyQ8

Abbie explains it better than I ever could. Gender is ABSOLUTELY a social construct. That doesn't mean it doesn't matter or isn't real, it just means it's something we've collectively created and we have the power to change it if we want to.
So, the *concept* of gender is based on social constructs that are outdated but still used to explain identity. Our identity, who we are, isn't a social construct. What we use to define our identity is a social construct. Basically, the labels, the terms, what the terms are based on, that's all man-made. But who we are is more based on three things:

1. Biology, how we develop and that innate sense of self

2. Sociology, how we are perceived and treated based on our biology in a culture

3. Psychology, how we perceive ourselves based on the role we were assigned at birth in said culture.

All are connected and intertwined. If we didn't treat people differently based off of how they're born into the world, that would heavily impact our identity absolutely. However, we'd still be ourselves, it would be just slightly different in how we perceive who we are. If we stopped using the concept of gender, which is man-made, and instead allowed ourselves to live and be who we are, we'd still be us. We'd just not use the labels and terminology we have at this moment.

Biggest thing I'd say that would stay the same would be the word dysphoria. It would stay, but the definition would change and it wouldn't be addressed with gender preceding it.
>We have existed for centuries long before a bunch of colonial YTs showed up with their erasure/imperialism and forced their oppressive religion on indigenous societies

This is actually how we know that gender is a social construct. Were it not, it wouldn't be understood differently in different cultural contexts. We wouldn't have gender binaries in some cultures and third (or more) genders in others.

Julia Serano introduces the idea of subconscious sex as distinct from gender identity, and I think that idea provides useful nuance for discussions like this.

Subconscious sex isn't a social construct, but the way you perceive yourself, the language, terms and concepts that you use to understand and communicate your identity with others is inherently the result of the social construct of gender

>We are worthy of recognition

Of course we are. 

Like gender, culture is a social construct too, and it similarly defines and shapes people's identities and self perceptions. It's considered worthy of recognition and protection. 

The fact that people use social construct to undermine gender is because they're transphobes, not because social constructs don't exist. Transphobes just say whatever they need to hurt us.
I think it can be a social construct cause so is money, so is every increment of measurement, every bit of language. The recognition that our thought forms are symbolic does not imply that they should not exist, they were all made with a reason, and if they don't suit the adapting landscape of humanity and or human culture, they can continue to be adapted. I see where you're coming from though OP, I've had arguments with people who think just cause a symbol or a label is not a physically real thing but is instead an abstraction means its not real in any way and we should abolish it on that grounds alone. That argument makes no sense cause theres tons of things we use as abstractions because they do a job in a much more convenient way than would otherwise be possible. Like yeah, miles, kilometers? All made up, but that doesn't mean life would be better for anyone if we all started talking about speeds or distances in fractions of light speed.

Also yeah, the phenomenon or phenomena which the concept of gender relates to is very real and can not be erased. So we can't abolish gender without radically altering the whole of society.
The way I tell people questioning their gender is that gender labels are just that, not a box or cage. You can take one off and put one on, at any time, for any reason, and your means of expressing your identity through appearance is totally yours. Be a trans tomboy, or femboy, or spooky goth chick or emo boy, or whatever. Try it all out, see what feels best, take multiple, it's fine, you don't deprive someone else of a gender by wearing five. ♥️
Would highly recommend philosophy tube’s video on social constructs, really changed my view on the argument of gender being a social construct https://youtu.be/koud7hgGyQ8
The language that is given to gender identities and the way it is expressed varies and def is a social construct but there is clear science to back that one’s sense of gender is a natural tendency and therefore can’t be something that society simply constructed.
Both gender and gender roles are social constructs. This just means that both gender and gender roles are created by society, and can also change depending on the society. I don’t think cis people will honestly ever understand gender abolition in the way trans people do, but I also do think you are misunderstanding gender abolition. Simply put, there is nothing “biological” about gender because it is a construct, and there is no objective reality when it comes to it either. Gender is subjective, and you get to decide how you interpret gender, and it will be different from how other people interpret it. Recognizing that gender itself is manmade, that there really is no difference between men and women at the end of the day is helpful to trans people as a lot of people think gender is something inherently biological or scientific, that gender itself will determine who you are/determine your personality (this is known as gender essentialism). The idea that gender is in some way related to how you think and act directly harms trans people as it either misgenders trans people and places them in a wrong category, or it fails to mention that trans people do have different experiences or relationships with their gender than cis people. Gender can be very important to you as an identity, and that is absolutely fine! But also there is no objective difference between men and women (other than how they are treated societally, and even that itself is flimsy) and the meaning of your gender is for you to decide; you are able to place your own meaning upon it. I always think of it as something like a story. You and I can hear the same story but take different meanings away from it, and interpret it differently, just like how you and I could have the same gender and we can have a different meaning or different relationship with the same gender. “Gender is a social construct” definitely has been watered down by a lot of cis people over the years, however it basically means that there is no one true meaning of gender, because we all have our own experiences and interpretations of it. I hope this helps! If you want, I can recommend some queer theory that talks about this sort of thing to help you understand better. But I definitely understand your frustrations as cis people have a habit of misunderstanding a lot of these things and messing it up. I also think though, that you’re associating these ideas with those harmful cis people, and as such you’re distancing yourself from these ideas, which is understandable, but I think it’s incredibly important to learn about these as they ultimately help with the liberation of trans people. I hope my comment makes sense and I’m here if anyone wants to ask any questions!
Social construct doesn’t mean fake, it just means that it’s only real due to people/society at large all agreeing on its usage. Money is also a social construct. There’s no physical thing you could point at that defines gender, it’s just defined by people
I agree with this. I think people have an internal sense of gender. But what that has to mean for their life is completely arbitrary. In addition, the same person with the same internal feelings about gender might, in two different societies, times, or places, choose to present or identify differently, since the words we use to describe gender, and our presentation and pronouns and roles are really like the projection of the shadow on the wall in Plato's cave allegory.
I agree with you. If there was no society around to construct anything, I'd still have a need to be a man. People are welcome to talk however they like about their own gender, but it's not reasonable to make a blanket statement that invalidates the identity of other people, and that's exactly what this does.

ITT: people trying to change your mind

Gender abolition is absolutely being coopted by bigots as a cudgel against nonconforming folks. So much so that I've abandoned it as a concept (used to love the term as an egg). Much better I think is gender liberation, or if you're feeling extremely based, gender dissolution. It seems to me that the function of xenogenders over time will be to expand the pool of gender definitions so wide that it becomes functionally meaningless - which was the point of abolition in the first place but without all the hurting people involved
If it isn't a social construct that varies by society, history, and subjective experience, then what is gender? Please, define for us what it means to be a man or a woman that captures something all men or all women have in common and is not a social construction itself.
I second this. Social construct doesn’t mean “fake,” it means “labeled and maintained by humans.” There is naturally human variation and humans created categories to explain these differences. Unfortunately, many people misuse this term. It has been used by many to invalidate trans people; you’re right about that.
I have seen the phrase “gender is fake” uttered so many times by liberals.
“but the way they are labeled and the associations that come with those labels are socially constructed. That also doesn’t mean you should try to get rid of those labels, because that doesn’t really help anyone much if at all” 

I agree that the way ethnicities are labeled and the associations are socially constructed. Ethnicity itself is not a social construct but rather natural identity based on blood and natural diversity.
Different times and cultures give different language to individuals and have varying ideas of how gender operates. That part I agree is definitely socially constructed but the general concept of gender as a whole may be more than just a social construct if the idea has existed since the beginning of time is actually what I meant.
the TL:DR is that Gender IS the roles and expectations. Thats literally all it is.

I understand the need for labels, but anyone claiming that you can't have that without acknowledging biological sex as hexis - is real fucking stupid and arguing in bad faith. Which is on par for every TERF I've ever talked to.
Time is a social construct but that doesn't mean it is not real- it does exist, we can see time pass as events move from past to present and march on to the future. The perception and documentation of it is a human creation, but it exists without us anyway.
It doesn’t inherently mean it’s not real or valid, but it does mean we can change or subvert the meanings if those social constructs are oppressive"	wgc4w4	trans	124	0.84	2022-08-04 21:01:28
Trans woman are not misogynist for their transition goals	"Aiight I've been seeing this notion go around and I'm honestly getting sick of it.

People in trans spaces are willing to accept trans people who don't fit into what society wants them to look like in terms of their gender and that's great, I want people to be able to present however the frick they want.

However, I've been seeing a trend and I hate it, more and more I'm seeing people accuse trans women of being misogynists for wanting to look like cis women, and for wanting to fit that stereotypical feminine look.

Again I don't wanna force anyone to look any way, you do you boo, but like don't point the finger at other trans women who just wanna look a way that happens to be society's standard.

I wanna look as close to a cis woman as I can, and I keep seeing comments (even in trans spaces) saying that trans women who want this are misogynistic.

Again I want people to present however they feel comfortable, and you a trans woman and want a huge beard? Go for it, are you a trans man and want DDD breasts? More power to ya. 

But do not try to shame others for how they wanna look."	"Haven't seen this trend myself. But I agree, let people (cis or trans) look how they want. I personally wanna look as fem as I can despite my build and height. But I've also got a MtF friend who dresses like a tomboy and keeps her facial hair. We're all valid x 💜
Yeah, I've seen it a little bit. I always thought it was just trolls. It reeks of terf ideology. Any trans people saying such things are such a disgrace.
Be damned whatever you do.

Are you trying/wanting to fit into ""the stereotypical gender roles"", then you are just reinforcing cisnormativity, whilst people ignore that a lot of the time this at least often makes you able to be more safe in your day to day life.

Are you not trying/wanting to fit into ""the stereotypical gender roles"", then you are just pretending and aren't actually really truly trans and might put your safety on the line for it as well, while we are at it.

The good ol' if you are trans, you can't do anything correct essentially:
I had a comment like that directed towards me. I made a post about I’m worried that I’m too old to get the results I’d be happy with, and this person just continue to attack me, claiming I’m a misogynist, claiming I’m not trans, claiming I’m ageist. 

It’s like I completely accept people regardless of how they look, but I have a right to care about how *I* look. 

I am not going to try to pass if I can’t, and I have that right. 

Ugh. I got “you hate women over 40!” After already attempting to spell it out twice. They were like deliberately misunderstanding everything I was saying. There clearly seems to be an advantage to starting before or during puberty, the earlier the better. That doesn’t mean I hate women nor that I’m not one nor that I hate women over 40 🙄

I just gave up.
I mean TERFs have a habit of popping in and posting on trans sub Reddit’s. I think this is really just something TERFs say along the lines of “we are appropriating them!” it’s just nonsensical screeching though.
Seems to be the cool trend. Just another version of “you’re not a real woman”.
I hate this trend too- arguably it doesn’t apply to me (I’m transmasc and am honestly fine looking feminine) but I hate when people call trans women horrible things for wanting to look as close to cis as they can. Because like-  

1) they can look however tf they want, surgery & or not

2) I absolutely NEVER see this with trans guys- like, trans guys can get every surgery possible, even the ones that aren’t even visible (like a hysterectomy) and they don’t get even a fraction of the hate comments trans women get for wanting to look as cis as possible 

edit: I think I’ve maybe seen 1 trans guy get called toxically masculine- but I’ve seen trans women get endlessly berated and accused of being misogynistic for their transition goals.
Sounds like TERF bullshit to me 1000%
Been learning more about second wave feminism and I see it’s toxic remnants everywhere, ruining so many things for all kinds of women.
I agree with you that Trans women should not be labeled as misogynists for transition goals but It is very important to acknowledge that the desire to pass/look femme DOES come from internalized/institutionalized misogyny. 

Instead of pretending it doesn't, we should all have empathy and understanding for trans folks seeing themselves through this lense. 

Women's beauty standards have always been rooted in the ""Male Gaze"" 

These standards are foundationally misogynistic and institutionalized in all societies. To say that this is not the case is just false.

At the same time it is absolutely absurd to think that trans women, a marginalized and underrepresented group should bear the responsibility of changing this aspect of human society. 

Trans folks are not responsible for combating misogynistic societal beauty standards; we are just trying to exist in a system that is fucked up and it's not our responsibility to fix it🏳️‍⚧️
I got into an argument with a friend a few days ago over this. I was depressed because I felt like I may never feel happy with myself, mostly due to the fact that I know I'll never be truly happy with any masculine qualities. I'd only be happy if I could present 100% feminine. but she started going on with the ""women come in all varieties"" schtick, which is fair, but dosen't change the fact that my dysphoria is still going to be there intil I can be the person I see I should be, you know?

but no matter how I tried to explain it it seemed like she didn't get it, so eventually I went off on her, and that ended badly. fortunately we made up, and got to hang out yesterday, which was cool. but I do think that people need to realize that some people want to be girly and feminine for their own sake.
Truth!❤️
I was told I was being misogynistic by describing my experiences with emotional cycles on hrt, saying I could not possibly have a “cycle” and that I was reducing a “woman’s” period to being emotional. 🤪
When I see these comments a lot of times they are new accounts with a few comments that are a day or two old. They are just trolls and do not listen to them. You should be able to express yourself how you wish to be more comfortable.
Ugh, when I came out to my sister she immediately said I was never going to be ""like her"" cuz I never experienced being a woman before 25 and what it entails, then she got confused when I asked her not to invalidate. She said she accepted me, but was constantly commenting things to invalidate me like if I had been doing a ""proper"" research or saying she will still call me with a nickname I hate (despite me telling her I hate it) cuz ""it's her way of calling me in a cute way"". I just decided to talk to her once I live by myself in some months
Wow I thought you meant a while ago but that shit is still going on?? And of *course* she has posts defending JKR and basically calling trans women predators...

Can't seem to understand that the cycle is regulated by hormones including (gasp!)estrogen and progesterone and that someone that is taking one or both of these hormones might develop something similar... how are these people always the ones to claim ""scientific fact??""
I’m afraid I won’t get over the dysphoria due to not having those experiences. I’m so envious of the women that do/did. It’s disheartening to hear that people invalid you by saying that, and I’m sorry your sister, your family, says those things.

I remember the first time I liked what I saw. For me, it was fleeting, but encouraging. I think my eyes changed first. The shape of the eyelids changed so my eyes look larger and I really noticed and cherished that.
Glad you wanted to share your beautiful  face

I'm trans and it won't ever go away.	"I've done just about every level in the denial game. I've felt every emotion from euphoria to the lowest levels of guilt and shame.  Finally got tired of living the lie to myself. HRT helps a ton and frankly if I never pass 100% I'm OK with it. At least I'm taking the best care of myself in my 50s and I'm no longer missing out on life. 

Let's hear your story."	"There are certain inalienable truths when you are trans. You will never be cis, the journey is never over. That can be frightening for a lot of people, but the way I look at it that is no different from everyone else. We are constantly on a journey.

Mine started 3 years ago when I finally came out and left my ex wife and my son and took this long overdue journey. Like many I got tired of hiding and lying to myself and others. Truth be told I am 32 now and I started feeling the gender feels when I was 12. Crossdressing on and off through the majority of my teenage and adult years.

Now that I am free and out I feel so much better and I too am taking so much better care of myself.
I just turned 50, I'm married with three kids, and like you the lie is becoming too much. It is becoming very exhausting to keep hiding / denying myself the freedom of being me. My therapist now knows because we were heading on a wrong path because I was lying to her about what was causing me to isolate from everyone / everything. My wife knows a little as I have told her as much I have been able to feel comfortable with. She has struggled with it and is scared about it which I completely understand. I think it is fantastic that you are able to freely work on yourself and I hope that one day I can get there as well. My instinct to jump back in the closet and hide has been very overwhelming since telling them about myself, but I am working on that.
Well, I'm kinda glad I'm trans, sure I miss the time when I thought I was a cis guy, and sure I'm sad that I wasn't born a cis girl, but being trans has done so much for me, its helped me to understand who I am and help to understand others like me, its helped me to get over what internalised transphobia I had, it has taught me so much I didn't know and has let me help people I never would have known the pain of, if I hadn't realised I am trans, I never would have seen a certain post on r/traaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnns that allowed me to connect to someone who would later become my girlfriend. So as much as dysphoria and discrimination hurt, what hurts more is the thought of a reality where I didn't realise I'm trans when I did, where I never met my girlfriend and thus her mental state would have gotten worse

So as much as it hurts, I'm glad to be trans
I hear you, sister 🤗 I'm 51 and started my transition yourney about a year ago. Now I'm out to evryone and got nothing but respect and support because of it. As I read the posts and stories here on the various trans subreddits I just wanted to offer my support to other transgender people and their close ones.
I'm so happy to hear you are thriving. Sadly you lost some things, we all do. But gaining ourselves allows us to be better for those who we are in relationships with going forward. Thanks for sharing.
Also we have inalienable rights such as life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness! Not an American btw just liked your wording lol
I've jumped back in too many times. At worst I will feminize to non binary and let people guess what's what.  We are not selfish for seeking transition I promise.
What a great reply Amber. Happy to see you with someone also.
You've hit on something there as well, it certainly feels selfish, like why should I work towards happiness at possibly the cost of others.
And it's NOT selfish. Doing nothing is to everyone as you won't be able to give 100% of yourself while you fight the internal battle. Ask me how I know.
I think I get that, because when I shutdown / isolate I’m not very nice to the people closest to me and they have no idea why."	sy4wqi	trans	88	0.97	2022-02-21 21:24:31

Followers; No, Not the Transphobes, Some Other Ones	"This was a comment I made in reply to another post, but I figured it deserved its own post.

The transphobic user name followers, I just delete, they don't bother me at all. In fact, I giggle a little bit at the sad life all of them have, thinking that they are actually accomplishing anything at all by their efforts. It's actually kind of pitiful.

What does bother me, as a transgender woman (with some SFW pics posted on reddit) is when someone with an obvious sissy fetish follows me. Not trying to kink shame, at all, it's perfectly fine to have a sissy fetish, if that's your thing.  What's not fine, and what squicks me out, is when someone with a sissy fetish follows a transgender woman (with no indications that said woman is at all interested in the sissy culture or fetish) because they think that transgender = sissy.

That's flat out just not right."	"Yeah that feels incredibly icky.
100%
Seriously, just…ew.
Absolutely 100% feel the same way. Have had a few of these types of accounts follow me on Reddit and Instagram too and those ones always make me feel a little iffy.
I got the same follower I think. That was my limit and I turned off the notification type. The transphobes didn't bother me as much as the ""sissy ownership"" bs
I’ve had this happen to me. Someone with a sissy fetish on an obviously brand new account followed me and messaged me saying that I needed “a daddy and a man to support me through my transition” as well as some sexual advances about being validated as a sissy. Needless to say I was pretty disgusted.
This is nasty, and I really don’t mean to kink shame or anything but why do chasers/sissy even exist? Is it like a power fantasy? Is it just thinking that having female and male sex characteristics are hot? Also, why do they have to be creepy!? Just say “Hi! I’m Tomothy, I think you’re cute. Do you want to go on a date and maybe do the s3x thing?” I feel like people are being creepy on purpose and throwing away their chances with the person they want to do the s3x thing with. 😤
The thing with fetishes is that they should still involve some degree of consent. It’s gross as fuck if you’re randomly searching the net to find folks to fetishize that aren’t consenting to being fetishized. Stating that or calling out that type of behavior is not shaming at all..
Agreed, 100%
pretty gross!!!
Ugh. Gross.
Agreed, 110%!
What’s worse is when they message you with that mindset thinking that for some reason you’re going to reciprocate and be interested. Yeah.. nope. Instant goodbye.
Do you mean instant report and block?"	onitf9	trans	80	0.99	2021-07-19 17:28:55

My father can't look me in the eyes. It hurts	"My father, even though he has a very conservative view he's one of those people who would love their children unconditionally (supposedly). He has been making a huge effort to broathen his perspective over the last few years but transphobia still remains (in our society that's all he's been exposed, so it's normal he developes this point of view).

After months of huge conversations where I described what I was going through without saying the name, he always gave me lots of support and motivation and he always understood best what I was struggling with (""do what you think it's best, even if it's a radical change, even if no one else agrees, do it for you, we'll always be here for you and will always love you no matter what it is"").

Last month I came out to him and told him what it was really about (just tyat what I was going through is gender dysphoria and that I'm trans and need to transition, I didn't even ask for different name (as I don't have one yet, annoyingly) nor for different pronouns yet). As expected he was shocked, confused and worried that I may be influenced by others/internet, that I may regret it, yada yada... All within expectations.

But today I came back to visit my parents and now he doesn't look me in the eyes, barely speeks to me and there is so much coldness and distance when he does speak to me. It hurts so much, I never in my whole life expected to feel this from him. I expected much confusion from him but never this. All the love and support gone just like that. My mother says he cares and loves me but I don't feel any of that, mostly I feel a bit of shame comming from him. I don't know what to do... Feeling all this from someone I, since birth, always ' knew' would have my back no matter what hurts so goddam much...

TLDR: My father always loved me and supported me matter if he didn't see eye to eye, but ever since comming out he can't look me in the eye, barely talks to me and I feel distance, cold and shame comming from him and it hurts and idk how to deal with this"	"Maybe he needs time. I feel my father may react the same way, but eventually, he will adjust. I think they need to see that this is the new normal and that it doesn't change how you feel for each other. You are a family, now you have to race on the streats to gain your honor (? *Plays fast and furious theme*
Sadly, I feel like I got a similar reaction from my father. I remember coming out to him and he said that he “couldn’t be happy about it but I still love and support you,” and now the only time he texts me is to judge me on my spending habits (I am a college dependent and my father is my benefactor for it so he pays for everything). 

Honestly my father often makes me feel as if I’m just a disappointment to him. It’s depressing.
Im so sorry :( my parents are the same way, and it can be very painful. Took my father almost a year to start acting normal again. I still get deadnamed even though I try to correct them, but I am still very much myself in front of them. Its helps having siblings who are supportive. I've even caught my mother using my correct pronouns and name subconsciously during some conversations so maybe theyre coming around..? who knows. Point is be you, be proud of yourself, and be happy. Surround yourself with loving and supportive people. Everything will get easier with time ♡
Transphobic men stare at the floor a lot in our presence and I think it’s a lot to do with them being afraid of staring, fear of finding us attractive and “turning them gay”. Your dad’s behavior may be more about him than about you.
As long as it takes us to come out it’s take other just as long to adjust and come to terms with it. There’s a loss for them .. it’s hard but true
Thanks, I know he needs time and was always aware of it I just didn't expect this reaction

>You are a family, now you have to race on the streats to gain your honor (? Plays fast and furious theme

""Nothing is stronger than family"" *smiles in Vin Diesel* (sorry couldn't help it 😅)
Tbh I'm already the disappointment of my family, thanks to several depressions and probably dysphoria before I was conscious I ended up not able to finish college and now that my younger brother finished it it was the last nail in their perspective. As if I'm not worth it anymore and they shifted focous to my brother. So I'm used to it already, but I didn't think it could get worse.... It did...
It hurts to see myself almost as a stranger in my father's eyes. I do hope it gets better... Thank you ❤️
I've still to come out to my family, and when i do, i think i will get the same reaction, i hope not. But i have been changing my clothing, painting my nails and he has given me the looks of ""haha, what is this? Okay, but you are ridiculous... boys these days..."".   
Hahaha, i had to make the FF joke too"	s8gwdj	trans	83	0.97	2022-01-20 11:28:01
I didn't think I was allowed to be this happy...	"About two weeks ago, my egg fully cracked. I went from ""questioning but probably trans"" to ""definitely trans-something-or-other"".

And it's like my entire life has changed. I'm Billy Pilgrim, unstuck in time. Everything is beautiful and nothing hurts.

I don't feel like an imposter anymore. My whole life, I've felt like a person-shaped *thing*, cobbled together from garbage and pretending to be human. It turns out I *was* pretending, but the thing I was pretending to *be* wasn't ""person"". It was ""boy"".

I'm starting to like my body. I've got a skincare routine now. I've got an aesthetic! I'm shopping for clothes and excited to try them on, instead of just being a mannequin for whatever other people think I look good in.

I can imagine having a future where I'm happy and make the people around me happy, instead of one where I'm miserable or dead. And it turns out it's because boy-me *didn't* have a future where he wasn't miserable or dead. Trans-whatever me does!

I've been with my girlfriend for ten years, and she says she's never seen me like this. I haven't self-deprecated in days. I can find things about myself to compliment, and saying them aloud doesn't feel shameful or dishonest. The compliments she gives me feel self-evidently true instead of like little lies to numb the pain.

The other day, she said something small to me, like ""hey, you look really cute today"", and I burst into a giant smile and said ""I know"", and she let out a big laugh, and I just felt so happy I didn't know what to do with myself.

I've spent so many years being so miserable, and it never occurred to me that it was all optional.

Everything is beautiful, and nothing hurts. And I'm never going back."	"I genuinely loved reading this so much. I’m so happy for you and thank you for the positive read before heading off too bed. Good luck with everything.
I hear you. I'm turning 40 this year and after 20 years of therapy and misery I have found what fixed me. Feels like 1000 lbs has been lifted off me. My friends have been very accepting (aside from a couple I'm hesitant to tell)  and all my military buddies are supporting me 100%. got my appointment for my referral to the endocrinologist tomorrow and hopefully can start HRT this month...

&#x200B;

Good on you. It feels good being able to say it out loud. Best feeling I have ever had.
So there is happiness...
Love every paragraph of this :)  
Never noticed it myself, but I relate to the ""believing in compliments now"" thing. Strange and pleasing\^\^
Same situation here - My egg cracked earlier this year and I had no idea it was possible to be this happy just by existing. I guess that's what they call euphoria :D
I love this and sooooo get the feeling. You will have moments when you might slip but try not to let it make you spiral. I have a bad habit of this, especially around my PMS cycle when emotions are high. You might get it too on hormones should you choose to go that route, so be ready for it and don’t let it win :) congrats on being happy
Such a wonderful outcome, thanks for sharing your story.
I love this so much!
I’m riding a similar wave rn, a happiness that everyone deserves xx
Of course there is 💖 I know it can all hurt and it may not feel like it now but you can get there too!
Why the heck is everyone so lovely here :D
How I see it is some (a good number) of us have it hard enough already. Kindness and unconditional love cost nothing to give :) even if I **can** be a little bitchy at times lol I know some of us need that positivity in our lives.

Trans in Sports: The Revenge	"Some States are passing transphobic bills to keep trans girls away from girls teams in schools. These trans girls are not in the Olympics. They are just having fun and socializing. These bills kill. They increase the suicide rates in a group with extremely high suicide rates. 

Under these bills, a student’s gender would be determined by the “biological sex” indicated on the student’s original birth certificate issued at the time of birth.

To fight this shameful acts of hate, there is a LGBTQI+ group that can help: trans boys. Under these bills they are considered girls (by “biological sex”), so they need to join girl teams. Even if they are not good at it. Just as an act of protest to help our trans sisters. If they do not let trans boys be part of the girls teams, they could sue them for discrimination. Next time, the haters will be more careful about what they wish for."	"Transmasculine athletes are hurt by these bills alongside transfeminine ones. You're not wrong to highlight the fact that trans women are the main targets of these bills, as we make convenient boogeymen for the cis public, but I'm not sure pushing trans boys into girls sports is a helpful solution. 

What we really need is deep and sustained organizing efforts within our communities, and allied with other communities seeking brighter futures, to help see us through this storm and make a world where we are free to be ourselves.

Don't forget there's some places that are supposedly trying to mandate.. genital inspections for kids sports. But that's totally not any sketcher than a girl with a slightly too deep voice going to the bathroom right?
If these people were gonna be convinced by trans men in women's sports, it would have been when Mack Beggs won the Texas girls wrestling title two years in a row because they wouldn't let him compete in the boys league. Reason means nothing to them, only hate.
Same with bathrooms, I bet. I doubt cis women feel less threatened by fully transitioned trans men being forced to use the women's room than they are the occasional pre- or early-transition trans woman using the women's room.
this, trans boys in girls sports generally feel the same way about that as trans girls in boys sports

forcing trans boys into girls sports as a ""comeback"" to transphobia against trans girls is not the answer, it just perpetuates more transphobia

transfems, please consider how you'd feel in the reverse situation before you sacrifice our wellbeing for an attempt at yours, thanks :/

Heads up, buddy! There is no difference, a ""trans man"" is a biological ""man"". Ask all the biologists you want, people you don't like are still people. For example, consider my friend Alice. You might think the reason Alice is a 'She' is because of things like her XX chromosomes. It's actually the other way around. All you know about Alice is that she's a woman and because of that, you assume those other physical attributes. I'm not trying to nitpick an individual term. Language like this is easy for a robot like me to spot and is indicative of other gaps in knowledge. Nobody can be expert in everything but there's a danger in the type of advocacy comments like yours have. Consciously or not this discourse is contributing to ideas that harm trans people just so people like you can avoid having your biologicalassumptions corrected.

These bills are banning trans girls in high school from playing sports like tennis with their friends.  They’re mean spirited and transphobic.
I agree it should be discussed at the Olympic level but these bills all target high school sports. High school sports don’t fucking matter. Let kids play on the team they want, it literally doesn’t matter to anybody but them and it can matter a whole lot to them.
They are pushing HARD to broaden transphobia against transmasculine people, with the hysteria surrounding ""our innocent girls being corrupted and rejecting womanhood.""

How do I cope with the fact that I'll never be happy?	"TW: internalized transphobia 

1. I'm extremely self conscious. I'm a little overweight and I'm too depressed to fix myself
2. I can't afford any hormones on my own because I'm 16 and don't have a job. my parents are transphobic so I can't get their help
3. I've already tried socially transitioning (online) and it made me extremely paranoid. I felt like a fraud. Idk why. 
4. I don't even think transitioning will help me. I've tried on girly stuff but it just makes me feel shameful and guilty. I don't want to be trans I want to be afab.

It's not fair. I had a 50/50 chance of being who I want to be and I'm screwed forever. Even if I wasn't born female, it'd be nice to be a male with no dysphoria. Being amab means I'll never be able to experience growing up as a girl. I'll never be able to know what it's like.  the majority of men will be disgusted or turned off by me. And the ones that will be attracted to me will be fetishist and chasers. I noticed a lot of Trans people are porn stars and other stuff. I don't want to be that. I want to be pure. I want to have a nuclear family but I'll never be able to. I'm too weak of a man to support a family. I want to be a mother so badly. But ill never have that. Sometimes I think about killing myself so I could reborn a woman. Or maybe I'll just go to hell. Who knows. Sorry if this comes off as transphobic. I'm just frustrated and I hate myself."

I used to think and worry about that all the time. Then I transitioned. My life has never been better. People can still surprise you. Most of the people don't really mind. And those who do don't really bother me that much. I don't fear death. I feel not living more. May you find courage, happiness and peace because you deserve every bit of it. If you want something in life, you gotta reach out and take it. Make some noise and burn some bridges. Break some generational trauma while you are at it.

You are looking for happiness in external factors, when happiness is already within you. 
All of these things that make you unhappy are ideas. The idea that you are overweight or unattractive. Whose idea is it? The idea you cant have children. You can adopt, right? 
If you rely on external factors for happiness, you are right, you will never be happy. As soon as you obtain something you want, you will be happy for 10 minutes until your mind creates another idea of something else you want and unhappiness will start again.

PSA: Do not feel guilty for being trans.	"I've seen 5 posts minimum today on how people are grieving or feeling guilty for leaving behind their AGAB. It breaks my heart to know that my community and/or those around them are making them feel this way.

Yeah, you were attractive as your AGAB. But you are still that person, and will be just as attractive as your true gender. Fuck society's beauty standards.

Yeah, your parents thought you were cis. A lot of them thought they were going to stay married. Some thought they were good parents. And little do they know, many will be dropped as soon as you get the chance.

Yeah, your friends may think differently of you now. Guess what? Those aren't real friends! Find new ones. You have a whole community of people who support you and love you for your true self.

Yeah, a partner ended your relationship. Thank goodness, you dodged a bullet there! And if they havent and the warning signs and red flags are present, YOU need to end it! Do not ignore it!

Yeah, you had benefits being your AGAB. But you're uncomfortable enough with your AGAB to identify differently. There's no shame in questioning or experimenting at any point in your journey, though, remember.

Yeah, maybe you enjoyed presenting as your AGAB for [reason]. Perhaps a lot of you enjoy presenting a variety of different ways, and might want to look into Gender Nonconforming, Genderqueer, Genderfluid and Nonbinary identities?



TLDR; Do not ever feel guilty for being you. You are still you, except now you're being your true self. Don't let anyone make you feel ashamed of your identity."	"This is an important message so thank you for taking your time and writing this for everyone who needs to read this!!


I'd like to add: Never let anyone make you feel guilty for them needing to adjust. 
That's what I felt a lot. I tended to apologize to those who misgendered me for not passing well enough. I still sometimes apologize when someone feels the need to tell me that my voice still sounds female even though I can't change it much no matter how much I try to.

It is not your fault that you were born with features that are perceived a certain way by others, nor is it your responsibility to speed up anything your body or you need time for.

It is also not your responsibility to make others feel comfortable or make it easier for them to adress you correctly.
>Yeah, you were attractive as your AGAB. 

i was a handsome dude. but i am much happier as an ugly woman, than a handsome dude.

My wife wasn't an ugly guy, but I was not attracted to her until she started transitioning. (I also didn't meet her until then lol) but seeing her old pics, I wouldn't have given her a second look. You are beautiful as you are, and someone one day will love the smile you couldn't manage before.

There were no signs!	"This is just something that I (MTF) want to get off my chest. Whenever I heard that comment from people who knew pre-transition me, I just get so incredibly frustrated. But I’m also the type of person who will forget the answer to a question the moment I’m asked it. So I thought this would be a good place for it. 

Maybe you didn’t see the signs because every time I did something feminine you and others would relentlessly bully, and shame me for it. 

Maybe it’s because you’d try to constantly ‘correct’ my behavior. 

Maybe it’s because every time I did something that came natural and felt right, I’d be told that I’m being gay. Which was internalized as meaning bad. 

Maybe I was forced to go through all kinds of male rites of passage. Forced to cut my hair. Forced to wear certain clothes. Shouted at for putting on nail polish. 

So here we’re some of the fucking signs. 
I freaked out when I went through puberty and my voice became deep. 

I always gravitated towards the most effeminate looking men when I talked about how I wanted to look growing up (thanks jrpgs) 

I twirled in front of a mirror imaging myself as a ballerina or in a wedding dress. 

I constantly role-played as and chose female characters in games (until you mocked me) 

I only had meaningful friendships with other women. 

I went to sleep hoping I’d magically wake up in the right body.  Every damn night. 

I was an empty shell that could only muster the emotions of anger and had no purpose. 

I would buy outfits I liked for my girlfriends to wear them vicariously through them. 

Constantly answering that I’m a lesbian when asked about my sexuality since I was 13. 

Constantly avoiding using gendered words (non English language) when talking about myself. 

I could go on for another 50 examples. 

I didn’t get the chance to figure out my gender or sexuality because before I could even think it through I was bullied, beat and shamed into thinking that I didn’t have any options. 

I didn’t get the chance to do so because I had to go trough so much other crap that I was in survival mode for 25 years. 

I didn’t have the chance.  

/Rant over."	"I feel this so much. according to my mom I stopped showing any signs after I sent to school. She thought I was trans at some point but ended up thinking it was nothing because the signs disappeared. The signs disappeared because I immediately caught on to how the other kids reacted, and I was terrified of being excluded, so I hid it from everyone out of intense fear. Until even I completely forget about it when I entered my teenage years. and those were the most abhorrent years of my life, I didn't even recognise what I was feeling as dysphoria because it was never talked about anywhere.

I've never been told there weren't any signs, but I was constantly reminded I was different. I was asked if I was gay, I hated being compared to guys cuz I wasn't like them, I was terrified of the things puberty did to me, I was in despair. I had to hide literally everything that made me me because if I didn't I'd be ridiculed. I was terrified.
Omg this resonates with me beyond words.

I've been getting that line from my mom a lot lately who is in complete denial and despair over everything.

Never could figure out relationships and I believe every romantic partner I ever had asked me if I was gay at some point or another, often in an aggressive or demeaning tone.

Forced to cut my hair, forced to wear clothes I hated, forced to play sports. Never ever holding any connections or fitting in with the boys. If I did attempt to make male friends it was bullying and being called the f slur for expressing myself around them. Not understanding why my body image issues could never be cured despite obsessive fitness and workout routines

Early signs in my life were shut down almost immediately in my family when I would play with my sisters Barbies, try on my moms heels, skip around the house, ask to play gymnastics, and often berated for ""talking and acting gay"" etc.

Lol no signs because I was in self-preservation mode literally FIGHTING FOR MY SURVIVAL in society since I was a young child.
There were always signs, whether we recognized them ourselves or not, whether anyone else saw the signs or not.
Relatable af. I've never been attracted exclusively to any one gender and still pre transition but when it comes to cis women I've had relationships with, I think all of them were either openly bi or more than bi but in the closet and had male nicknames for themselves and would do other masc stuff. They knew long before I figured it out and wouldn't even say anything smh. Second hand signs are also there when you look back.
This hits home hard. 

Thankfully most people have come around for me, but there's always people that can't see you for who you are. They can either accept you; the real you, and those who mind don't matter. 

Its crazy to me how any social expression of gender variance is immediately shunned. We talk of living in a free world, but in reality we're being forced into tiny social boxes rather than expressing ourselves for who we truly are.

Yes, you may not understand me. Yes, you may have been too blind to notice me. But if you truly love me for myself, regardless of myself then you will accept me for my full and truest self. 💜
There was someone I knew pre transition and saw absolutely no signs. When I found out she’s trans, i was sad she never felt COMFORTABLE enough to show me any. (She would have been in a no win situation by coming out then, totally no judgment on her) It NEVER crossed my mind that just because I saw nothing meant there was nothing going on!!!

People actually feel entitled to see signs that you’re trans? Like if they didn’t see anything, that means you aren’t?? Every time I find out the shit that binary trans people who knew from a young age and came out much later deal with, I’m glad I’m not. And I hate people more.
Literally every woman I pursued asked if I was gay. Everyone could see something was off about me and no one gave a shit. They just saw a depressed and angry teenager and thought nothing of it. 

But omg yes. You react by hiding to protect yourself and then people are surprised.
Wow! This hit me like a ton of bricks….. for me people just viewed me as more “flamboyant” than the normal kids. After having to suppress it for years due to constant bullying and harassment I hid it and put on my “masculine face.” I could never figure out why I consistently felt “dead inside,” but after reading an article for parents of signs your kid could be trans that my egg cracked as every point on that article was my life. I just wished that I had realized when I was a kid and asked for help.
+1 for people thinking I was gay. I was genuinely angry, because I wasn’t denying anything. I just didn’t like men"	12o0fay	trans	63	0.96	2023-04-16 07:57:29
tips on how to move on from your family?	"Hi yah,

&#x200B;

I am Merel, and I am a transgirl mtf(hrt 1 year and 3 months). I have a bad relationship with my family before and since I came out.  My mother and I just don't match, and she said this quote when I asked her how she saw my transition: ""it's a mistake, but you're an adult and grown up enough to make this mistake yourself."" so yeah... my sister also hates me because I posted a news interview saying my home life wasn't great, and she said that  I shamed the family. My father is absent because he chooses my mother over me. And my little brother, I don't know how he is standing in all of this, but yesterday I asked what he would for his bday and he said nothing...

&#x200B;

So I don't think this will heal, and I want to go on. I have srs in less than 2 weeks, and are there any of u out there who also had to deal with mentally separating yourself from your family? Any tips or tricks would be helpful :(

loves,

Merel"	"Honestly, my tip is to just cut contact.  Eventually you’re going to think about them less and less but that will take time to get there.  It’s painful to interact with people that hate us and say we are “making a mistake” or “choosing” to be trans.  Why subject yourself to the toxicity?
I had to accept the fact that sometimes some people wont ever come around, sometimes they can. Family isnt always family, sometimes you have to go out and find your own family. You gotta be your own pillar, though.
My tip is to form that closeness with new people. I’ve been moving on from my family (though am still tempted in from time to time) by living with my current roommates. They are my best friends, and we learned together how to unconditionally love and support people. We formed a family together, and left out the toxic traits of our biological families. We taught ourselves this by communicating with each other, lifting each other up, and making sure each of us knows we’re here for one another, no strings attached. And following through on those promises. And owning our mistakes. It’s been two years of hard work, but I genuinely feel like I don’t NEED my bio fam any more. I have a real family now, made up of friends. Our close friends outside of the home have also helped us learn and shape how we wanted to be too, and they’re definitely a part of the fam.

I’m not saying it’s easy to do either. I mean. I moved multiple states away to live with my roommates. We were close online friends first and had been for multiple years and met up in person multiple times. And then we moved multiple states again to live close to our mutual close friends so we could see them regularly and get healthy, out of home support. But we were also a weird case where we had been come a tight knight friend group all online lol.

I hope this helps in any way. I wish you the best, sister! 💙🫂
It is perfectly OK to love your family, and yet not like your family. Though my story is not quite as severe, I am in a similar boat where I just don’t talk to them unless I have to
I spoke to my mother for the last time a week ago and basically told her to pack up my important documents for me so I can move on, it wasnt coming out that destroyed our relationship, just another reason I didn't want contact. It takes time to come to terms with the feeling of losing that bit of you and I hope for your sake it wasn't a large part of your life. I strive to be as independent as possible, but that doesn't mean you can do it alone, you need a support system to get through this sort of thing. I recommend reminding yourself about the fact that nothing made them see it as anything but a ""mistake"". If being trans is wrong, I don't want to be right
Ghost them, and dispose of whatever unnecessary mementos remind you of them. Something along those lines? 🤔 ...it's kinda my plan anyway, but I'm not even out to family yet... 😮‍💨
Family are people you think about all the time and want to be around, and they think the same of you. It sounds like this relationship is one sided. I recommend finding people you can have this mutual relationship with. It may take time but it will be worth it.
My experience was similar and the hard truth is that it is likely permanent. I’m not saying not  to try if that feels right to you, but prepare yourself  for the possibility that it’s just not redeemable.
I cut off my mother completely about a year and a half ago. I think the first step is to understand that a bigot's love is not unconditional and your love for them is one-sided. The next step is to realize for every happy/good memory you have of them, there's memories of them hurting you. The last step is to make sure you're 100% independent from them. After that you can choose if you go completely no contact or if you attempt to set hard boundaries.
Being independent of them, financially, and making a new support system. I have a troubled relationship with my family and im convinced that when my dad dies (hes the only one even trying to keep me around) i just wont be a part of the family any more.

Im bad at making friends but my partner's friends accept me into the group which helps a lot. Having people around who accept you is important to help you move on past the void. I also figure rewiring how you think about the people who raised you helps. They *were* your family. No longer thinking of your parents as your parents can help. It was easier for me as an adoptee (who was constantly reminded im adopted..) but i think anyone can do it with enough time.
Make your own family. I haven't talked to my sibling in 10 years. Before that was even longer. Tried 10 years ago to rekindle but she hasn't changed at all, if anything she is worse than before.  I have my own friends and family now and don't look back.

When asked, she's estranged and leave at that. No regrets at all. Keep your head up and live your life that makes you happy.
Hang on- did you warn your sister before the interview? As it affects her too? Everyone has a right to their own words, but if they're going to be airing family things they at least have to give the affected party a decent warning. 

Is she mean or just upset over something you did? Not enough info....

The others sound toxic
I.. essentially had a similar issue where my mom told me she would never support me and that I'm mentally ill, but she still loves me.. most of my family has similar ideals, but I don't hold belief that they actually love me, cuz if they did they'd support me. So essentially I've just cut myself off from them. 

It's not worth the pain of them constantly reminding you of such a feeling and though it sucks to hear such things and get that finally understanding they don't support you, but it's better in the long run.

Stay safe 💜
i already cut bonds with them a year ago. but the feeling of longing and getting back is getting worse. i know its toxic, but the ""it still is family"" keeps my head occupied.
I guess so, my gf has an amazing family and i feel home there. :)
That’s completely understandable.  It’s super painful to have these toxic people in our lives but we still want them to be there.  We just want them to accept us and love us for who we are, not who they want us to be.  

You can try to let them back in but know that many people won’t change.  This is why so many of us have had to create our own chosen families.

Good luck with your surgery sister.
If you’ve taken that step, the next step is finding a new family. People that actually care about and support you for who you are.

I lost half of my family when I came out. Thankfully, my girlfriends family accepted me completely. That hole your toxic family left can be filled with people you don’t share DNA with."	x1g28h	trans	57	0.92	2022-08-30 11:00:13
does anyone else feel ashamed?	"I'm finally starting to accept that I wanna be a girl, and I wanna transition but I feel embarrassed. I feel like I should be ashamed of myself and that nobody is going to respect me.. what if in ugly, or what if it's not what I think it is. I don't know.. do you guys feel the same way?

EDIT: I am in no way saying I have internalized transphobia, I'm not grossed out or shameful of being trans or transitioning, I just have severe anxiety and know that I'm not gonna end up being viewed as a girl for a very long time, if ever, and I feel like I'm going to be harassed for it"	"Transitioning is getting to the point where your motivation becomes more powerful than your shame
I struggle with this. As a kid I was shamed for those girly mannerisms and desires. I'm old now and I still find it hard to shake.
I used to but honestly you eventually reach a point where it doesnt matter we're not hurting anyone and plenty of cis people worry if they're ugly or not be yourself hon you only have one life to live would you rather spend it fighting a war with yourself or do what you need to and move on
I was bullied and made fun off for being a very effeminate  nerd as a teen before i came out. And even when i did come out, it took a long time for me over what others thought of me.

But at a certain point. Idk i just said fuck it? And stopped caring what others thought. After facing adversity from my mom, former friends, bullies, old coworkers, and the like. I just said Fuck'em. They aren't worth shit.

Now its been years since ive had any problems with transphobia. Im 26, on hrt for 4+ years. Been out for 8. So yeah. There's nothing shameful about us.
Don’t worry girl your not alone
Idk I feel like a disappointment and drug addict because I’ve been on HRT for a year. My family has an very bad history with drugs. 

Tbh you just gotta ignore the negatives. Focus on what you want to get to and how you will get there.

Do it for you not what others think
My kid feels the same way. Getting better further into transition. Honestly, you have to harden a bit against misgendering. It happens and it’s accidental most of the time. People are getting better. I’ve seen it. And most are happy to learn your preferred pronouns when you correct them, and you kindly should. It builds the confidence. I’ve watched it happen for my own child. Good luck! Keep reaching out!
It's ok to be ugly <3
Well I am 67. Been on HRT for almost 2 years now. I live in a city where a lot of people know me as somewhat of a hardcore biker. I accidentally outed myself on Facebook about an hour ago! 😱
One of the trans groups I belong to asked people to post a pic of when they were the happiest! Sooooo I posted a pic of me in makeup and lipstick! One of my good friends and biker buddies from another state responded and said red is not your color bro! Ugh! He said it came up on his newsfeed. I panicked! I texted him and told him he knows something about me no one else does! He replied just be you! If anyone doesn’t like it then fuck ’em! So I deleted my facebook account! But you know what???? I kinda felt some relief! We have to live our truth! It’s not easy and not gonna be for me, especially at work, but for me it’s baby steps! Blessings
Nope, I'm proud to be transgender and a lesbian.  I've put a shitload of work into my transition and am finally starting to reap the fruits of my labors.

I generally don't like the idea of internalized transphobia, but that's what you're dealing with.  A good therapist will help you sort through that.
All the time. Except when I'm masturbating because somehow I've managed to put up a healthy no-shame zone in that department. It gets weird sometimes, but only because I like it.

But yeah, when it comes to day to day life I often look at myself and judge myself from what I think others would think of me. I feel like it's impossible and I can't possibly be ""good enough.""
Absolutely. Trans man here, I know what you mean. When I was younger, I was so pretty, I had gorgeous hair and a dazzling smile. Sometimes it hurts looking at myself because I know I'm not that girl, it almost feels like wasted potential. But I also know, even if I look like something out of silent hill, I am a man. And I'd never have it any other way. Rather live ugly and happy than pretty and sad. Also makeup does wonders lol.   


Also, sadly some people will always see us as something else. I decide to adopt my identity as a trans man instead, so if they claim ""oh lol ur not a man"" I can hit em with the ""I'm a TRANS MAN"" type deal. if it helps, try that. I know it doesn't work for everyone. Sometimes these things never go away, but I hope what I wrote helps. Best regards.
How would it be internalized transphobia if you’re shamed about it? You can feel shame out of the embarrassment. Doesn’t have to be out of ignorance. But I think this is normal cause this is how I feel about it. One day I’ll be super happy about it and confident, the next I use the confidence from the day prior to mentally beat myself
This is normal! You are not alone and you are not crazy! Sending you so much love on your journey sis!!
This.  I'm so happy I finally hit that point.  I started HRT and feel like I can finally be the real me.  The road ahead isn't easy, but I can do it.
I like this :)
Thanks, this makes me feel better, I'm sorry if I worded this post wrong and triggered bad memories
Thanks, I appreciate the advice
Thanks, I'll keep that in mind 🙂
It's not internalized transphobia per se, I don't view being trans or transitioning gross, I just feel like I'm embarrassed to be in public because people aren't gonna see me as a girl I guess?
Hey, no need to apologize. I dont get upset about my old memories, im just an aggressive trans girl who swears a lot. Im happy to share my story especially if it makes others like yourself feel better.

My mom pissed me off so much I'm finally determined to publicly be a girl	" 

So I have started to transition almost exactly a year ago, but I'm currently out as transfem to only a handful of people, my parents included, they are clumsily supportive, well as long as they don't have to do too much effort, like gendering me correctly, too much for my dad 😒 But I suppose this is still much better than what a lot of people unfortunately get.

&#x200B;

So anyway, we got a brunch with my grandpa this sunday, and my original plan was to test the water by only coming out as bisexual, especially if that old f\*ck kept doing stupid comments about my newly found femininity, like he did last time. So I I was talking to my mom about the brunch, and tried to say my plan, but she kinda just cut me off when I said I wanted to come out, assuming I meant coming out as trans. And then she did a rant about how I needed to come out in advance to let him ""prepare"" or ""cope"" or some shit. And she kinda implied she was the one that should do it too. Now that's already shit, if i want to come out in person that's my choice wtf? But there's two thing that actually really pissed me off :

&#x200B;

1. The way she talks about it it's like a shameful secret, and I should be the one bending over backwards to make sure I don't shock anyone too much with it.
2. She never takes me seriously and she really thinks I'm super naive and that I think everyone will accept me immediately, and I cannot translate just how goddamn annoying she was about that. It'as also just symptomatic of her not trusting me in general, but that’s another story/trauma.

&#x200B;

Truth is I do NOT care what that old ass thinks about my gender identity, nor what she thinks about it, or really anyone else. Yeah, some people are never gonna accept me, some are even gonna hate me for it. I am much more aware of who she is, but I won't do everything to change that and to make those people ""comfortable"", screw em. F\*\*\* my original plan, if I'm going I'm coming out as a woman and doing it on my own terms.

&#x200B;

And yeah, as i say in the title, it pissed me off so much i realized how tired I am of pretending I'm someone else, next semester at my university I'm using my real name, I'm done with that deadname shit, and if anyone asks me I'm Marie, the other guy is not there anymore.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading my unhinged rant :) , tbh I really just needed to let it out lol"	"Gotta love that classic transfem ""look upon my field of fucks given and see that it is barren"" vibe. Good luck girl
Not giving a fuck is one of the best traits of many transfems i hope everything goes allright :D
Go get 'em girl! I love your energy!
We all need to vent. Good luck.
I feel and relate to the energy here so much lol. My family's severely religious and transphobic. I was outed prematurely and once they knew, their bigotry and hate fueled my bravery in being myself.
Good for you. Stay strong.
It’s the No more fucks to give song! Really though, good for you Marie! Continue to be awesome.
You've got guts and courage. Stay fierce!
Thank you! And yes, my fields of fuck is indeed empty right now
Tahnk you! It probably will go fine :)

And yes, not giving a fuck do be important, especially being trans \^\^
Thanks! I'll stop caring what assholes have to say and just hang out with the plenty of cool people around me instead :)
thank you <3
I'm glad ou got over thos guys, screw them all, we don't have to care about what others think about who we are
Thank you so much!
I will, thank you!  <3

Why can't I just go back to being cis	"I used to _like_ my hairy legs, I was _proud_ of them. Then I tried shaving -- it was wonderful and eye-opening and even arousing. But now I can't look at the unshaven parts without feeling awful, and I have to shave obsessively, to the point where my disregard for the razor burn it induces could potentially be considered self harm.

I was _fine_ with my dick, I _enjoyed_ it; even when I realized I was probanly trans or nb I was always planning on keeping it. But then I took a close look in the mirror while pulling it outwards so I could see the outline of where my vulva would be, and now I feel awful about it and I just want to rip it off to reveal a pussy underneath.

I liked my hair. Even just a week ago I loved how androgynous i thought it was. But as I dried it this evening, it got messed up into a feminine style and I loved it and felt this huge rush of emotions because it made my whole face look androgynous/feminine but then i felt empty and shameful and i forced myself to comb it back while holding back tears and ill never be able to look at my hair and like it again.

_Why can't I just go back?!_ I was so much happier, I was fine with my body! I don't want to be trans, every time I discover something new that makes me happy it ruins the normal version forever and it's just. so. _exhausting._ I never used to have any dysphoria, but every time I experience euphoria it adds another source of constant, paired dysphoria.

Why can't I just forget all this. why can't i go back to being normal. it really hurts, and in ways i don't even understand"	"A good counselor can help with this.  I never hated being male so I believed switching between the two would always be possible.  Then the more time I spent as a woman the more I wanted to.  This summer I dreaded going back to school to teach as a male. I had a few bad days of male dysphoria where the costume felt horrible.  

My counselor helped me down from that ledge.  I don’t like being in the male costume but I can tolerate it thanks to them.  I just reeeeaaalllly love being a woman!
Dang. This is so relatable and real. My vector is different but that pairing of euphoria causing disphoria is such a daily struggle. I remember the days of telling myself, ""I can be any kind of woman I want to be."" I was hot. I was self confident. I was great in bed and loved my body for giving me that pleasure... 

But I'm not a woman and every time I look in the mirror and see a masculine person I am so happy...then I take off my clothes and my binder and see someone who is disfigured. I can't stand people touching my chest. I have backed out of sex at the last minite with various people -even other trans people-  because my dysphoria has caused so much anxiety. 

The trans switch has flipped, I'm out, I can't go back in the closet. I have to transition to be happy and I hate that. I wish I could go back to loving my body. 

As my friend tried to comfort me, she said my body is my vessel, my ship, and I should feel grateful that I have it. But I feel like I'm trying to raise a sail on a canoe in the middle of the ocean. It's a great boat. But it's not the boat I need. 
Well, I think the most important part would be to get the question out of your head. I don't mean to be rude, but the only way is forward at this point, it seems like. If you're lookin to start taking those steps or you're already in the process, looking back is only gonna make it harder.

I can't say it'd be much, if any less exhausting, but maybe fully embracing what you can reach at will ease the burden a bit or give you some strength. I hope you can keep faced forward instead of back.  Rock the feminine hair if it works for you!
[deleted]
I can't speak for you or anyone else. But for me, the conclusion I've reached is that the 'comfort' I experienced with male puberty was more out of insecurity than it was real. I was happy that my leg hair had grown because it made me feel superior to my peers who hadn't been developing yet. It made me feel more mature. Same with muscle tone. I've always had a ton of natural muscle, notably in my biceps and abs. It's useless muscle, cuz it's not trained, but it's the type one could show off visually if I weren't so dysphoric about it, trying to hide my upper arms from view with baggy sleeves. In any case, my signs of male puberty only gave me comfort to the extent that they had mitigated some of my insecurities growing up. (My male puberty was always rather limited though, with little facial or body hair (aside from my legs), and that had caused insecurity.) Since my egg cracked though, I've come to realize how the comfort I felt was only present to the extent that it helped me find my place socially. It wasn't about any deep-rooted pleasure in having male body attributes. Now that my egg has cracked, I'm finding quite the opposite about femininity.
i dunno, i was never fine with these things, unless you mean when i was 10 year old and younger 
Goosh and I thought nobody else felt like this. I too had the gender euphoria before the dysphoria set in. I actually spent a year thinking I could just switch out of my female side until I just faced it and stopped repressing three months ago.
Yep, I believed for a while that I was genderfluid and only really strongly felt like I needed to be female about ~20% of the time. Eventually I realized I didn't have male days and female days, I had days without dysphoria and days with it. I was always happier presenting female regardless. 
This!  The female days are euphoric while the others are usually boring.  Then the male days got to be dreadful.  Now I actually dislike even male pants or a button up shirt.  I really hate being bald now.  "	9zwuem	trans	49	0.91	2018-11-24 08:17:38
How my parents (kind of) realized I’m trans	"Hi, I'm Alisa and I'm a trans girl. I’m almost 18 years old but I still live with my parents. I have always known that I am transgender, but six months ago I decided to buy some feminine things, like clothes and makeup. Then I started growing my hair out, started shaving off my body hair, and used to cross-dress at night. The first thing my mom noticed is that I started shaving my legs, so she started to suspect about me. My mom has always been supportive of the lgbtq+ community, but my dad has some negative thoughts about trans people even though he respects them.

Three months later, I was in my room at night in my ""girly"" clothes and fell asleep. As soon as I woke up my mom was in my room crying and yelling at me, I immediately covered myself with a blanket. She called my dad and he turned pale, they started crying like something was wrong. (I understand why they had that reaction, I never gave too many signs or details about my transgender issues ). After that, I talked to them saying that i am confused about my gender, I also came out as bisexual (I actually am), so they understood that, they started supporting me. I wasn't feeling well at the time, so they took me to therapy with a psychologist. I told the psychologist about my gender issues and she is giving me feedback (that's a good thing). now i feel better about myself Even though they kinda know , I'm afraid to tell them directly that I'm a trans girl, I have that feeling of shame for what happened that day..."	"I am a mom and I have a trans daughter.  You did NOTHING wrong!!!  Please do not feel like you have anything to be ashamed of!
I can understand if you're scared. Risking rejection is scary. Your parents are probably scared and confused, too. Why do you feel ashamed?
Right off the bat, I am so sorry that happened to you, I hope you’re feeling better soon. You have nothing to be ashamed of at all, everyone has a right to self exploration. Everyone also has the right to their OWN bodily autonomy ! 

I HATE when I see people in the comments saying “well your parents are probably scared and confused too” like how on earth does that help anyone??? your parents are gonna have to work through it or they lose their beautiful daughter. You cannot control how you feel or how your body and mind are aligned, people CAN however control how they react. Come out to them when YOURE ready, Idk if they come to you 10 times a day and ask. You do it when YOU are ready.
Appreciate your comment!! could you give me any advice from your perspective as a mother?
I feel ashamed because I didn’t feel prepared to tell them at that moment. It wasn’t the way how I wanted to happen.
I wanted to tell them in an appropriate way when I'd feel ready, like a talk or something.
Hi Sorry that I did not see this until now.  I have found that it is SOO important to really listen to my daughter and not try to speak for her when she struggles to express her feelings about herself.  I always want to ""fix"" things but sometimes it is just a good thing to be wholly able to not interject my thoughts until I know it will be acceptable.  I am learning to be patient! lol
Are you ashamed or would it be better to say you are disappointed in yourself. Or is it that you may have disappointed your folks?
>R

I can understand feeling that as a lost opportunity.
I think both of them."	y57ucv	trans	53	0.97	2022-10-16 04:44:19

deadnamed publicly at school:( anything i can do?	"i am out at school/ partially stealth. all the teachers know (at least they should be aware), i use the girls bathroom, and everyone calls me my preferred name. (no one, besides staff and friends knows it)i’m sure students can tell i’m trans or at least not cisgender because of my voice but outside of that i pass. 

today i had my dead name broadcasted through the intercom to go home. (my school doesnt do this period, i have no idea why they did it this time) my friends immediately turned to me and mumbled in shock. 

once i got home i cried of embarrassment and shame. is there anything i can even do? the teacher who manages the intercom constantly dead names and disrespects my pronouns. i played it off as her not liking me, which is fine. she’s old, i don’t let it get to me. but this is too far. any advice???"	"Wow, is there a school counselor you could go to? Maybe they could work it out? I don't know what the situation is in TX, but my school had counselors.
I live in Houston too, unfortunately. It's supposed to be the second most progressive city in Texas, but it's still just a flaming pile of shit. Anyway, I'd say talk to your principal if you can. They'd be pretty much the only person who could do anything about that teacher. If not, sadly the best course of action is probably to just lay low and keep your head down. The recent wave of anti-trans legislation puts you and your family in serious danger if the teacher decides to make a stink. I'm sorry hun, but I know you'll get through this. Us transfems are a resilient lot. Good luck. Stay safe :)
i live in htx btw!
the counselor that was actually easy to approach just left:( but i’ll definitely see the other one tysm
Ofc you know your school better than me, but is it possible that it’s a mistake with their system and not intended abusively? Could she just have an incorrect name sheet that could be updated if you ask the principal’s office?
my school is extremely small <400 students and every teacher knows every student personally, even if they aren’t teachers/ don’t teach that student. word of mouth
oh wow ok. she sucks."	tn6svl	trans	49	0.95	2022-03-24 22:04:23
First post here, Shame it's a negative post though	"So, didn't think I'd end up posting something here, but I feel that i need to get this off my chest.

(A bit of backstory to this: me and my dad have never really got along, but I'm normally quite forgiving so I thought I could trust telling him something like this)

I'm 17 and currently male but came out to my family 2 days ago that I've been wanting to become female for over a year and my dad was the first person I told.

He was visiting me for the day to be able to see me before Christmas because he lives decently far away, so I was really excited to finally get the courage to tell him. The day was going smoothly, we were at a Café to get a coffee and my dad brings up a random story about a guy walking around in a dress and said that he ""didn't think it was normal"". That should've been a red flag for me, but I thought it was the best time to tell him because he brought up the subject of being trans and I came out to him about wanting to become trans.

he laughs it off until I tell him I'm being serious about it and looks at me with really sad eyes and simply just says ""no"". I got really confused and asked him why and he starts demanding me to tell him where I got these ideas from and I told him I did this on my own and it was my own decision, except for all the research I did. he asked me if I actually asked anyone I know who is trans and I told him that I'm good friends with someone on discord and that a lot of my online and personal friends have supported my decision and encouraged me to come out to my parents in my own time.

He then decided to say something that crushed me hard, ""Anyone you talk to online is fake and they don't actually care and as for your ""friends"" (yes he actually said that sarcastically) don't actually know what they're talking about because they are younger (they are all my age group so that's a lie) and you are making a big mistake"" and then proceeded to list everything he thought was a negative without giving me a chance to explain.

I got up and starting running, trying to hold back my emotions, I felt lost and helpless that someone i trusted decided it was ok to try and belittle my choices that hard. He ended up catching up to me and saying he's trying to be neutral on how he feels which made me break down completely, in public, in front of a crowd of people. we had a meal planned but i demanded him to take me back home, i wanted to get away from him because he can't accept me for who I am and he did, i got back home and broke down again in front of my mum (who was very accepting of my feelings and told me that she thinks it's great that I'm being so open about it now) and told me to talk through it to calm me down. but now that she knows and that people accept me for it, I've never felt better, as for my dad, we haven't talked since. I think it's for the better though, but I cant help but think i overreacted or not.

tldr: i came out to my dad about being trans and got verbal abuse from it"	"You did not overreact. Sadly a lot of trans people receive that kind of response from their families when they come out but since we can't control how other people react, we can only hope for the best.

Try to take it one step at a time and if you feel bad or anything, try finding a support group who understands you. We are here if you need to vent but having real life friends who understands you is always best. 

I hope your father will come around and realize how important it is to accept you.
I have a father like that. He claims online friends arent real friends and thus they have no legitimate opinions whenever he disagrees and realizes he is wrong about something.  If he doesnt accept you as his daughter you have no reason to accept him as your father imo.
[deleted]
I haven’t come out to my parents yet, I’m 30 and have only told my wife so far but I’ve had feeling since I was about 11-12. I don’t really know much about your father but it sounds like a response mine would of given if I told him when I was 17. I think he does love you, to him his son is about to make a huge life decision and that this just kind of came out of no where. He’s probably thinking there weren’t any signs and that online friends aren’t real. At least that’s how my father thinks. I hope he’s just scared for you, he knows lgbt people have a harder time in life and face discrimination (he just expressed some him self with the dress comment) and that he just wants you to have the best life possible. He probably only know the general stereotypes of transgender and the lgbt community. 
If you plan on going to a therapist (I recommend it, a neutral 3rd party that you can talk to and  not have to worry about those conversations coming back to someone else in your daily life can be really freeing) it might make him feel better knowing that your seeking help and that this is serious and not a spur of the moment thing. I’m not sure how close your parents are but this is probably something your mom could communicate to him if you don’t want to talk to him again. I think your response was completely justified, rejection is very hard and my biggest fear. Having others know about your struggle can really help so I hope your mom continues to help you in this.
Your dad is a cunt. Wait until you're 18 and do it. Fuck him. And fuck my parents too. They don't change, I'm 36 and they have never fucking changed. The older cis generations.(I'm assuming your dad is gen x or older) can all get fucked.

I get daily verbal abuse for being trans by my family. We both need to remove the toxicity from our lives
I hope he comes around too, it seems so weird to be close to losing someone over gender
Edit: I'm not actually sure how insensitive that might sound, just know I mean no bad things when I said that
Thats a really good point actually, I never thought of it like that
I've always been brought up to forgive but this actually gives me a reason to change and start ending toxic relationships between family that share that opinion
aw ty <3
I understand. It's something we've seen a lot of here so I understand your feelings. We're here if you need to vent.
Honestly, if your parents are the ones who taught you to forgive, it sets you up to forgive them for things you shouldn’t forgive.  If he’s not going to accept you as you are, he doesn’t deserve to be in your life.  If he does apologize, only accept it if it’s genuine, and if he actually seems to be changing his ways.  If he says anything transphobic after that, shut him out again, and for good.  No third chance."	rmx37o	trans	43	0.91	2021-12-23 14:42:00
FINALLY realized why I had so much doubt	"I've basically been out to myself and my parents for about two weeks now, and I've had SO MANY doubts about myself and with being transgender. All of these doubts happened despite the fact that there are so many signs of both dysphoria and euphoria, and that my therapist basically said ""yeah, you're probably trans."" 

Shame. That's the reason. 

I felt ashamed for feeling this way, and for doing feminine things (mtf). This was such a problem that I started hating myself a little bit, just for being me. 

Thankfully, though, it seems like after coming to this realization (combined with the fact that there is NEVER any shame with being trans) most of that has vanished. 

It's going to be an uphill battle, and I'm probably not
 out of the woods yet, but at least now, I'm more than willing to finally be myself."	"This community has been extremely supportive to me. Thanks everyone <3
Thank you. I needed this today :)
This resonates so well, thanks for sharing! I definitely deal with my own internalized shame. We’re allowed to be ourselves!!
shame and embarrassment are big things for me, my therapist recommended a book called Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead by Brene' Brown"	nbu9m8	trans	44	0.93	2021-05-13 23:14:42
My son is trans and he’s the best thing in my life.	"Hi everyone. I have a child that was AFAB and has been living as male for nearly 2 years now. I hope I’m in the right sub for this and I know this is long so if you don’t want to read so much, there is a TL;DR at the bottom. 

To begin, my son is turning 12 at the end of the month (Sept 27). A few months ago, he started puberty and it was so traumatic for both of us. He cried and I cried and it was so hard. It hurt me so much to see him in pain and I knew then that I’d do anything to take that pain away. I was just not ready for this to happen so soon. I didn’t start mine until I was almost 17 so I thought he had plenty of time. I immediately found him a therapist and he’s now into his third one that he’s been seeing for a few months (the first two didn’t work out but this one seems to be going well I think). And recently she told us that he is okay to start puberty blockers (yayy) so I’ve been trying to find a pediatric endocrinologist that can get him started. I hate to watch him go through this horrible experience and it makes me feel so terrible for him. I hope to get him on the puberty blockers asap, especially with his birthday around the corner. Speaking of which, I want to do something special for him because the last few years have been very difficult between his father and I splitting (after years of fighting and me putting up with his abuse). I made the decision to leave and moved my son and I 3 hours drive away from there. My son knows his dad is a bad person and he doesn’t really even want to see him. He’s very protective of me and couldn’t stand seeing me being abused. There’s been so much pain and suffering in our lives and I really want this to be a special birthday for him. So any ideas are welcome. I can’t seem to get anything out of him. He won’t ask for much because he knows I don’t have much and he doesn’t want to stress me out but I keep telling him that money isn’t an issue and this birthday is going to be special whether he likes it or not. So I’m kind of on my own trying to figure out what I can do with him that will make it special. 

Anyway, moving on from that, I guess I’m here because I don’t know where else to go or who to talk to. I love my son more than anything in the world and he’s the most amazing person I know. He is just so smart, kind, and brave; he’s just such an amazing kid. He calls his cycle his “man period.” Which I don’t know where he got that from but I love it. And yet, I have so many things that worry me. I know he’s strong and he can handle almost anything. I just want to do whatever I can to help. I grew up in a family that was very homophobic and made me feel terrible about who I was. I want to make sure my son doesn’t ever have to experience the shame, humiliation, and depression that my own family put me through. 

My mom says that it’s somehow my fault that I made him think he’s a boy because I’m so open about being pansexual and about my own struggles with my gender identity. I don’t really identify as either gender and I’ve been using the label non-binary for now. I’m still figuring it out. I changed my name a long time ago because I hated my birth name, it was too feminine and it just didn’t fit me. I use a more gender neutral name now, Lee. But my parents refuse to call me by that name even though I’ve been using it for close to 15 years now and they’re the only ones who call me my birth name, which I hate and it has a lot of trauma attached to it. I’m sure you all can understand that. 

I also caused a lot of drama when I named my baby Elliot (I chose that name after having an ultrasound and being told I was having a girl). My entire family hated it and I had people literally coming at me with lists of alternative more feminine names (like Ella or Ellen and similar) and berating me for choosing a “boys name” for my female baby. But I didn’t care and I refused to budge. I just loved the name so much and now I’m so glad I didn’t give in because people have thought Elliot was a boy from the very beginning. For the first few years I was constantly having to correct people when they thought my baby was a boy and I thought I had a girl and of course he was too young to tell us yet. On top of the whole name thing, it bothered my family that I let my kid play with all kinds of toys and wear all kinds of different clothes. I never believed that toys and clothes should be gendered so I always just let my kid play with whatever he wanted and dressed him in a variety of clothing from both sides of the store because if I liked something then I got it and it never mattered to me if it was labeled for boys or girls. My kid played with dolls and kitchen sets and also cars and tool kits and so on. Whatever he liked, I let him have. I know that none of that made him trans. I know he was born that way and I believe him when he says he’s a boy. I’ve had a feeling for awhile because he used to tell me that he liked when people referred to him as male and as he got old enough to choose his own style, he would always ask me to get him boy clothes and to let him cut his hair shorter and shorter every time. And I always felt my job was not to dictate how he dressed or what he played with but to just let him express himself however he wanted. He came out to me officially when he was 10 and I was scared at first because I felt like he was too young. But I also never doubted him for a second and I know that he is sure about who he is. I’m so proud of him because he’s so strong and so smart. 

About a year ago, he said that if he could have just one wish, he would wish that he was a boy. I cried. But I knew for sure that he was a boy and I would do anything to help him be himself. His happiness is all that matters to me. A few months later, he decided he wanted to come out to the family and even to people at school. Most of the kids at school thought he was a boy already because he looks like a boy. Fortunately, his teachers and counselors were very supportive and kind and they even let him use the one gender neutral bathroom in the office because he was afraid to use the boys bathroom or the girls. That helped a lot. 

The scariest part for me was coming out to my parents. I knew they wouldn’t be so open. My mom still thinks he is “way too young to make this kind of decision” (she doesn’t understand that it isn’t a choice) and she’s told me that I’m pushing him in the wrong direction because I’m encouraging him by allowing him to dress how he wants and helping to get him put on puberty blockers. I know that is total nonsense and I’m not going to listen to anything she says. It just bugs me so much. She misgenders him a lot but I make a point to correct her every time and it’s actually gotten better lately. She is starting to use male pronouns more now and I’m going to keep correcting her if she slips up. At this point I’m giving her the benefit of the doubt and just trying to teach her that being trans or gay or whatever is not a choice anymore than her being straight and cis is a choice for her. I’m so proud of my son for everything he’s helped me achieve, for being brave and helping me to open up the minds and hearts of my family. I honestly never thought they’d accept him and even though it hasn’t been easy, it’s not as bad as I expected it would be. 

So I guess I am here for some advice and maybe also some stories from some of you. If it’s not too hard to share, I would love to hear what your experiences were like. And for those who had negative experiences, what is something you wish your parent or other loved ones had done or said to make your coming out and/or your transition easier? What do you wish they would say or do now that would make you feel more validated? The reason I ask this is because I want to make sure I do the right things and help my son feel proud to be himself and show him that I’m always on his side no matter what. 

I’m willing to do anything to make my son’s life easier. I know he will deal with some bad stuff and that I can’t protect him forever. So I want to prepare him for that. At the same time, I want him to see that there are plenty of good people in the world too, who will love and respect him for who he is. I want to show him that he’s not alone and that he’s loved and respected. 

I’m sorry for the long rant and I hope that I didn’t break any rules here. I just have been wanting to reach out to others for so long. I’ve been wanting to hear stories, experiences, and advice. So that I can be the best parent I possibly can be for my son. Because especially now I am all he has (and he is all I have). He struggles to make friends. A lot of that is my fault because we have moved so many times. And having to start middle school online isn’t helping. It’s been him and me for a long time now but the last few months we’ve been just the two of us at home all day every day because of the pandemic. 

I struggle with mental illness myself and I left his father because he was abusive. I had to move away from him for my own sanity and to start a better life for my son and myself. I wish I could get him to talk to someone but he has a hard time opening up fully and I never want to press him on anything because I don’t want to cause him any pain. I just want him to be happy. 

So if you’ve read this far, thank you. And if you have any advice or stories or anything to share with me, I will be eternally grateful. 

If I posted this in the wrong place, I’m so sorry; please let me know and I’ll remove it. If you can point me in the right direction then I’ll go there. I just didn’t know where to turn. Life has not been easy for us. I know it’s been hard for so many people. I hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe. I look forward to reading your responses. Thank you so much in advance. You are amazing people and I love you all.

TL;DR: My young child (AFAB) came out as trans and I want to be as supportive as possible and make life easier, better, and happier for him. I’d love to hear your stories, experiences, advice, etc. Thank you.

Edit: I just noticed someone gave this post a wholesome award. That is so sweet. Thank you. You are all so amazing and I’m so glad I decided to post here. Your comments have made me feel so much better. 🥰"	"I honestly dont have anything to say bc you seem like a grwat parent. It puts ME at ease hearing about binary breaking/gender ruless parenting and how i might want to parent my maybe future child. Ive been looking for examples and im glad i found one.
I have no advice for you but I just wanted to say that you seem to do everything right. You respect and support and love him obviously very very much and I think you're doing everything right. I think you're an amazing parent!
I'm crying right now, reading this. You're such a wonderful parent, and your son is so lucky to have someone like you in his life.

I identify as non-binary, but am seriously struggling with the possibility that I might just straight up be, but more on the masculine side, and I wish my parents were even half as supportive as you. I was accidentally outed by my well meaning brother to my parents, and have dealt with all sorts of"" comments such as ""keep it between you and your friends"" when I tried to explain my pronouns and ""you're perfect just the way you are, you shouldn't worry about your chest"" when I expressed severe discomfort and a wish to bind.

I don't have any advice other than to keep doing what you're doing. It'll be hard, sure, but with someone like you in his life, he'll make it through. Thank you for your story.
You’re doing everything right. You’re making the boy happy and even tho he has a crap way of showing it, as teenagers do, he loves you to death and back. If it would make him happy, I’m sure that the majority of people that have seen your post would want to wish him a happy birthday. There’s plenty of things that he might like on Etsy, so I would start there when coming up with a present idea. Maybe dog tags or his name on a necklace with his pronouns.
You're doing the best that you can by your son. Most parents wouldn't have done half the things that you've done for him and it just goes to show how much you truly care for him. If he isn't telling you what he wants for his birthday, it might be because he just wants to spend time with you. Birthdays aren't all about the presents. I wish you both the best of luck on your journey together. Be well and stay safe.
Females hit puberty sooner so try to get him male hormones quick I know some girls who grew breasts at 9
You sound like a really loving and supportive mom gj ❤️ this is kinda random, but I was just curious because I don't really know a whole lot of gender dysphoria and stuff. I've seen some people, especially younger trans people, say that a lot of children are diagnosed with gender dysphoria by doctors/therapists before they start puberty blockers. I know that doesn't always happen though, so what are the requirements to get it? Like, do the doctors diagnose them as well beforehand? (Pure curiousity)
Thank you. I have always believed that everyone deserves to be loved and respected for who they are and not ever let society or anyone push their beliefs on others. It bothers me how my family tried to do it to me and it made me want to go hard in the opposite direction. I honestly struggled with my gender identity for a long time and I didn’t really know that I could be anything else but what I was told that I was. I just always felt like I didn’t fit into either category and didn’t realize that there are more options. But when my son came out, I started doing a lot of research on gender and it opened my eyes to so many things. I feel like I never would have been able to understand myself as much as I do now if not for my son. He expanded my world in ways that I never could have imagined. I have known I was not straight since I was little. But I didn’t really know much about how my sexuality related to my gender identity or expression. It’s such a beautiful thing. I now understand that gender is a spectrum just like sexuality. I hope to find a community where I live that I can get involved with and maybe meet some new people. My sons first appointment with his pediatric endocrinologist is later today and I’m so thrilled. It was originally scheduled for later this month but I kept on top of them and they managed to squeeze us in. I am so excited and also nervous. I think I still have so much to learn and I am always happy to learn new things. I appreciate your kind words. And wish you all the best in the future. 🥰
Thank you so much! I always have so many doubts and I question myself all the time. Like I never know if I’m doing the right thing. I am constantly terrified that I’ll mess things up. But I have severe anxiety about everything so it’s not just this. It’s only more extreme because my son is the most important thing in my life and I would do anything to make sure he has a happy life. I feel like this is the minimum of what a parent should do and I can never understand any parent who doesn’t love and respect their child. I know so many kids whose parents don’t accept them and it hurts me to see that. I wish I could take them all in and show them they are all amazing and beautiful and deserving of love and respect. And shame on those parents who can’t accept their own children for being themselves. Those people make me so mad.
I’m so sorry that you’re having to deal with that from your parents. I can relate. My own parents were extremely homophobic, as was my brother. I was bullied a lot at school and at home just because I never fit in. My own family called me a freak and a weirdo and my mom would compare me to other girls my age and ask why I can’t be more like them. I also have several mental health issues that went ignored most of my life. That led to self harm and multiple suicide attempts (all of which my mom still denies even when the scars are very much there on my body). It’s insanity how parents can be sometimes. I never thought I’d be a parent and never really wanted to be only because I was scared I’d be like my own mom. And sometimes I’m scared that I’m doing the wrong thing. I’ve made a lot of mistakes, mostly because of my mental illness and putting up with my abusive ex out of fear. I know that stuff was very traumatic for my child. He’s seen me at my worst and it can be very hard on him. But no matter what, he knows that I love him and there’s nothing in the world that could change that. I even recently started seeing a therapist again because my depression has been so bad and I wanted to show him that I’m willing to work on myself because he’s been in therapy for awhile and he doesn’t think he needs it. So I thought maybe if I did it too then he’d see that therapy isn’t something to be ashamed of. My own family refused to put me in therapy because my mom was afraid of what people would think of her. Her reputation as the perfect mom was more important than her child’s mental health. The way my family treated me left me with zero self esteem and then they wonder why I am this way. I got the same kind of nonsense that you described like just be happy with your body how it is and just be normal and stupid stuff like that. It’s so ridiculous to me how anyone can say those things, especially to a child who is hurting and confused. My parents didn’t allow me to even have friends who were gay because they thought that it would like rub off on me or something. I don’t even know what they were thinking. I could tell so many stories about how my family treated me growing up but it’s not important now. I think of it as a learning experience. I could never treat my child that way. It’s not just wrong, it’s borderline abusive I think. 

I knew for awhile that my child was different and I was determined to let him figure it out on his own without pushing any sort of agenda or trying to put him in a box. It hurts me to hear stories of families rejecting their children. It brings me pain but also makes me so mad. When you bring a child into the world, you’re meant to love them no matter what. For awhile I identified as bisexual but then I changed to pan because I think it’s more inclusive and also bi implies there’s only two genders and I know that’s not true. Gender and sexuality are both spectrums and there’s so many wonderful amazing people all along those spectrums. Every single one of us is deserving of love and respect for who we are. 

I hope that things get better for you. If you ever want to talk, you can reach out to me. I’m always happy to chat. I appreciate how brave you are to share you story with me. And I hope you know that you are amazing and wonderful and that you deserve to be loved and respected for who you are. And nobody can tell you who that is. Only you know in your heart and mind who you really are. If your family can’t see and love the real you, then honestly that is their loss. They will miss out on an amazing person. I think you’re perfect just the way you are but not in the way that they see you. If binding is what makes you comfortable and happy, then that is part of who you are and you should do it. Never let anyone define you. It’s your life and you deserve to be happy and comfortable in your body. Whatever it takes to get you to that place, you should chase after it. I wish you all the best. Stay strong. And never forget that you are beautiful, strong, and you are loved. 🥰
I just bought a beautiful flag that he found on amazon which is essentially the trans flag and over that is a heart with the pan colors. It’s beautiful. He pointed it out to me and said, “look it represents both of us.” So of course I could not resist buying it. He’s also been complaining about needing a new phone for awhile so I spoke to my parents and they helped chip in to get him a new phone in his favorite color. He got it this weekend and I think he is very happy about it. Also, last week I took him to get his hair cut because we haven’t gotten a hair cut since the pandemic started and he was very unhappy with his hair. I took him to a highly recommended speciality salon instead of the cheaper ones we usually go to because I wanted to make sure he was happy with it. And we looked through some photos of haircuts for men and talked with the stylist to get it just right. And I think it looks amazing. It’s actually the first time he has gotten a haircut and not had a single complaint about it so I think that means he likes it too. He’s also been asking me for some new clothes because a lot of his stuff is old hand me downs from his dad and older brother but for the most part he just shares my clothes because I have a ton of men’s stuff that I like to wear (I have a good mixture of men’s, women’s, and gender neutral clothing and we’re about the same size). I always let him pick out what he wants but it’s been awhile since we went shopping. He asked me yesterday if I’d take him to the mall soon to get some new clothes and shoes for when school reopens. So if we have time, I’ll surprise him with a trip to the mall later today. I think he’ll be thrilled. Whatever it takes to make him happy, I’m there. Because his happiness brings me happiness. 

Also, even though I wasn’t able to get him into the endocrinologist before his birthday, because they were booked out for like a month, I stayed on top of them and kept calling and bugging them until they agreed to squeeze us in earlier. They put us on the list to be first if anyone canceled and then they called me Friday and said they had an opening this Monday and so of course I said yes we’ll take it! So in a few hours we will be seeing the endo for the initial appointment! I’m so excited. And I’m sure he is too even though he isn’t showing it. He’s been very pessimistic because he doesn’t believe he’ll be able to get on the puberty blockers. For one they are super expensive. And I’m currently unemployed. I don’t think insurance covers it. But I’ve promised him that I’ll do whatever I have to do to get him on it as soon as possible. Even if I have to max out all my credit cards and take out some loans. Whatever it takes, I’m not giving up. I told him that his treatment is my number one priority. He knows all of the things I’m putting aside for this. Like continuing my education, upgrading my equipment for work (since I do freelance work from home and my stuff is old) and whatever other things I need. But like I’ve told him over and over again, those things can wait. His happiness and comfort cannot wait. I hope that as things progress he will see that I’m not bluffing and that I’m 100% here for him. Nothing is more important. And of course I know that he’s going through a lot with just starting puberty and the wrong kind. It’s hit him very hard and I can’t blame him for feeling so miserable. I can’t even imagine how hard it must be for him going through this. And I just hope we can get things moving fast to stop it. I cry a lot about this because I can see he’s in pain and he is always trying to hide it from me. Because I suffer from several mental health issues and am recovering from drug addiction as well as ptsd from years of abuse, he has seen me in a lot of bad ways. There’s been times when I couldn’t get out of bed for days and he started to notice that I wasn’t eating so he’d bring me food and watch me eat. It’s almost like role reversal but I wasn’t able to control it. So I’ve started therapy again recently because I realized that this is not healthy. I don’t think I’ve ever had a healthy relationship in my life. But I don’t want my son to suffer anymore because of me. I am constantly afraid that it’s too late and the damage has been done. But now I have to put my own feelings aside and take care of him. Because he needs me. And I know the sooner we can get him treated, the better and easier it will be for both of us. I’m sure the next few years will be very hard on him. But I’ll always be there to support him. He’s my baby and I love him so much. And I know he loves me too. He’s just scared. Which I can understand because so am I. But I know we will get through this together. The main thing that he’s been complaining about is that it will take forever until he can really be himself and I can’t really help that cuz he’s so young. I try to tell him about people who’ve had to live half their lives in the wrong body and how lucky he is to be able to start treatment at 12. And I found out recently he can even start hormones at 16 if he wants which means he’ll only be a bit behind his male peers as far as starting puberty. And hey I started puberty at 16 and was the last person in my peer group to start puberty and looked like I was 12 when I was 16 but I got through it and so will he. But it’s hard to explain to a 12 year old that he can’t just get everything done in a day. These things take time. But I also know that time tends to fly by. I’m so excited to get him started on his path to his true self. 

Anyway, sorry for the long rant. I honestly haven’t had anyone to talk to about this and it’s been eating me up just keeping it all inside. Thank you so much for your kind comment. I know I’m not perfect but I’m trying as best as I know how. I didn’t have the best role models for parents and I also rushed pretty quickly from my parents abusive home into a marriage with an abusive man, which took 12 years for me to get away from and even in the last year since I left for good, he’s still got a hold on me (as the biological father of my son) and my son sees that and it hurts him. He doesn’t even want anything to do with his father who isn’t really a father at all. I’m basically his mom and dad. Which sucks for him, I know. He deserves better. I know I’ve got so many problems. And I know my kid has had to deal with a lot because of me. I’m really working hard to make our lives better. I’ve always put my own mental health aside because I didn’t think it mattered and I tried to control it myself and hide it but I know now that I can’t be a good parent unless I take care of myself too. So that’s what I’m doing now. I know that things will work out and one day my son will be happy. No matter what he will always have my support. Because that’s the minimum I can do as his parent. 

Anyway, it’s time for me to go get ready for the morning routine. I have to wake kiddo up for school soon, which is never easy. 

I hope everyone has a great day and week and all of that. I appreciate all the kind comments. You have really made my day. I’m glad I took the chance to post here because I was not sure what kind of reaction I’d get. But I feel a lot better now. So I’m glad I went for it. Thank you so much. You’re all amazing.
Thank you so much. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in my life and as a parent but accepting him for who he is is the easiest thing to do. I don’t have any problems there. 

I did try my best for his birthday. You can read my comment above (you might not want to though cuz it’s so long). Basically, I got him a new phone (with some financial help from my parents), a haircut he loves, a few other little things I knew he wanted, and also I’m gonna take him shopping for some new clothes and shoes for when schools reopen (which I would have done sooner, but he just told me yesterday that he wants to go to the mall to get clothes so I hope I can take him today if we have time after everything else we’ve got going on today or if not today, then sometime this week for sure). 

And the thing I’m most proud of: I managed to get him an appointment with a pediatric endocrinologist today! Initially, the appointment was a month off. But after I bugged them to please fit him in sooner because he was suffering a lot, they called me back on Friday and said they had an opening for Monday which made me so happy. This whole thing is hitting him pretty hard and I want to make it stop like before it started (if I knew it was going to start so young, I’d have started planning things way sooner, but sadly I can’t go back in time and I thought I had so much time because I didn’t start puberty until I was 16 so I was not ready for this to happen at 11, but it’s happening now and I’m trying my best to correct it). I just hope things go well at the endo today. I’m happy that we are finally on the path towards a better life for him. Because my sons happiness is the most important thing in the world to me. 😊
I know but it’s crazy because I am also AFAB and didn’t start puberty until way late. I was almost 17 before I started menstruating and thought something was wrong with me until my mom told me that she also started late. So I was so not ready when my kid started at 11! We have been trying so hard to get him puberty blockers but they are expensive the the insurance keeps denying us. Luckily we have an amazing team on our side who will fight this. We are now waiting for an appeal and we hope it will be good news. I wish I had known sooner. I started my son on therapy when he was 11 but I had no idea that it was already happening. I wish I had known so I could have gotten this started sooner. But I really was surprised given my own family history. I was just as devastated as he was when I found out it was happening so soon. I cry a lot about it because I just want to make life easier for him and I feel so helpless right now just waiting for a decision. It sucks. All I can do now is be there for him and try to be a source of comfort and support while we wait. Hoping we get a positive decision very soon! 🤞🏻
Thank you; my son is the most important person in the world to me and his happiness is very important to me. I think this is just what should be the norm for any parent, even though I know it’s not. It saddens me that so many parents refuse to accept their children for who they are. I love my child no matter what gender identity or sexual identity or anything else. He’s always going to be my child and nothing can ever make me love him less. 

So I’m not sure how it goes in other places, but I can tell you the process we had to go through (and are still going through). The first thing we had to do was get him a therapist who specialized in gender dysphoria in children his age. We went through three therapists before we found a good one and he’s been seeing her once a week for several months. Before anything can even begin, therapist must get to know my son and determine the correct diagnosis. If she thinks that he is in need of medical intervention, she must then write a letter explaining her diagnosis and recommendations for my son. She will be the first person who decides whether he needs and is ready to be put on puberty blockers. Once we got this letter, we then had to go to his pediatrician (or a general practitioner depending on what you have) to speak to them about the whole situation (which they have been aware of as they have been getting regular updates throughout). At this point, his doctor must provide a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. With the referral from the doctor and the therapist, we were finally able to schedule an appointment with a pediatric endocrinologist. After meeting the endocrinologist and discussing our short and long term goals with her, she then had to order a bunch of tests, which required us to schedule an appointment with a lab where they took my sons blood for tons of tests. Once the results of all the tests came back clear (as in there was no reason for concern), then we had to meet again with the endocrinologist to go over the results of the bloodwork, what everything meant, and whether he was clear to take blockers. She explained to us the possible side effects, we discussed our options, and made a decision together as to what would be best for my son. Through all of this, he is still meeting once a week with his therapist. Once our team of doctors, along with my son and me, agreed on a course of action, we then had to put in a request to our insurance for the puberty blockers, which they have already denied us twice and we are now waiting on an appeal. In the meantime, the endo put my son on a form of birth control pill to stop him from menstruating in hopes of reducing his dysphoria just a little bit. All in all, it’s been about a year and we are still waiting for him to get the approval to get started on puberty blockers. A little side note, when I called to schedule the appointment with the endocrinologist, I was told that both parents would be required to show up there in person and sign a bunch of paperwork. Fortunately for me, I did my own divorce papers and my crazy ex just signed them so I have full custody and legal rights to make medical decisions for my son without my ex husbands approval. I can only imagine what it would be like for other kids who might have one sympathetic parent and another who wasn’t so much because if they are married or shared custody, then both parents would be required to appear and honestly if I was in this situation and my spouse refused, I would leave him immediately and do whatever it takes because my child’s happiness matters the most. Luckily for us, we didn’t have to deal with that. I feel terrible for all those kids who have to deal with horrible parents who can’t accept them. Anyway, since I didn’t need my ex there, I was able to sign all the parental paperwork and my son had to sign some paperwork as well. And now we are just waiting. We were told that they do give hormones to kids usually around age 16, but that it could be given a bit sooner if the whole team (doctors, therapist, parent(s), and child) all felt that it was the right time. But that wouldn’t be for another several years yet. Which means my son is just being forced to deal with going through the wrong puberty and it’s very difficult. 

So if anyone tries to tell you that it’s an easy process, they are lying and most likely have an agenda. I’ve heard so many stories  from people who want to ignore the existence of trans people, despite the science that supports their existence. They want people to believe a young child could just walk into a clinic and walk out with hormones. That is absolutely ridiculous and an outright lie. Stories about kids getting hormones and irreversible treatments at a young age with no parental approval and many many sessions with a therapist are so fake and lie simply propaganda to scare people who don’t know what it is really like. No child is getting hormones or any other life changing procedures. Puberty blockers only delay puberty to give the child a chance to think about how they feel and figure out who they are without have to deal with the stress of going through potentially the wrong puberty. If the child changes their mind, they simply stop the puberty blockers and there is no long term impact. They will eventually go back to having their natural puberty and no harm done.

I’ve also spoken to many young trans people in various stages of transitioning. None of them had it easy. Not a single person. Everything we have done for my son so far is just to get him on puberty blockers and it’s a long, complicated process. My son is suffering all the time because of this. It’s so hard to see him in pain. I wish we had a better system in place. Way to many young people cannot get help and end up doing things that are just tragic. Sorry for the rant. I hope I answered your questions. And feel free to ask me anything else. I’m always happy to help. 

Oh wow I also just realized it’s been a long time since this message was posted and I am so terribly sorry that I didn’t see it before now. Life has been crazy. 

I hope everyone is having a wonderful Holliday. Merry Christmas and happy new year to all! Here’s hoping that 2021 will be a better year than 2020! 🥰
Thank you! I wish you two the best as well."	ixi1bn	trans	43	0.91	2020-09-22 06:17:16
Objectification	"Why are there so many cis men here now? Why are there so many pornographic posters from /traps /sissies and the like here now? I'm not trying to shame beautiful people flaunting beautiful bodies... I'm just discouraged by the objectification of transgender people. It shifts the focus of transition from struggle and support to sexuality and skin. It especially sucks when in the dating scene. There are so many chasers and creeps with a narrow view of trans folks. 

Sorry for the rant... Am I wrong?"	"No, no you're not. I'm fairly new to the mod team, but it's something that I really think should be discussed. I'm not 100% sure what to do about it either, but so far we've been stepping up our game and outright banning NSFW content here.
I made a post here about how happy I was to get my breast forms and finally feel euphoria in my own body once in my fucking life- and I got a DM from some creep that said “nice tits” and now I’m fucking livid.

My first slice of trans bliss and this fucking creep makes me feel like a piece of meat. I know it could have been worse, it could have been some transphobic garbage. But I’m still so fucking angry.
I kind of agree to this. Like I would like to start making content like that at some point, but this is not the sub for it.
It's such a shame. I love being desired and all, but without respect, it's no fun. I can't imagine how swamped the dating scene must be. sigh
Seems there has been a huge influx of trans women on here promoting their ""Only Fans"" sites and fetish sites.

They stick out like a sore thumb and you can tell by doing a 2 sec check on their fresh accounts (less that 30 days). Most look innocent until you look at the account and where and what they are posting for.

They mass post across reddit and it seems to be dragging the chasers into the safe places. They look where else they are posting and then join the other forums and treat it like a porn site.

EDIT:

I  also notice that they skirt the rules by posting safe photos in the  legit communities to avoid getting banned. They are just gaming the  system and it sucks.
I'm new to this sub and new in my transition and I agree. More power to anybody who likes to show off their body and is proud of it, but some posts seem to carry this...idk...exploitative vibe?
It's been a problem on this sub all through the pandemic. 

I understand, of course, that alot of people flooded into online sex work because of the pandemic. But I feel that it would be better, if you're marketing yourself as a sex worker, to make those advertising type of posts in  subs that basically exist for that purpose like /r/Safe4Trans or /r/GoneWildTrans. 

As u/Nikki_Bishop said the problem with advertising yourself in this sub is that chasers will follow you into what should be a relatively safe space and end up harassing others who are here to get support and engage with the community.
Thank you! If people want to post NSFW content they should do it on the subreddits made for it.
I don't envy your position of having to censor our community due to a trend started by uninvested self promoting new members. I really love seeing the occasional ""I got a new bra"" and or body transformation updates from our people who would have no other place to share. There is empowerment to be had... But now I see a lot of comments from throw away anon accounts by presumably cis men, who are turning this safe space into a ""hot or not"" destination.

What ever you end up doing, you have my support. It's just so unfortunate. 😕
I'm really sorry honey! Its not fair for your recent dysphoria soothing progress to have been minimized and subjected to that sort of behavior. Stay strong! You are valid and worthy of euphoria and bliss! ❤️

Sadly, I've excommunicated my inbox because of situations like this. It's sad because genuine people actually do reach out to me... But it's just not worth sorting through the filth.
Yes! Don't get me wrong... I love pornography! I dunno if that's a bad thing, but whatever 🤔🤦🏾‍♀️

....point is reddit has tons of places for that sort of thing in whatever flavor you like... But this isn't one of the places.
Haha... Yeah, no. To be clear, I'm not trying to find love through /trans. I'm saying that if every trans space becomes flooded with nsfw content, then that's all people will think of when they see transgender people out in the wild. How's a girl like me supposed to be taken seriously?? I'm a catch not a fetish!!

(I'm not actually a catch... Im fucked up inside, but you get my point)
Nailed it! This is the apex of my frustration. 

I'll be scrolling along and I'll see a beautiful members of /trans getting tons of karma and I'm like ""Hell yeah! Get it!"" 
I scroll through comments and... It seems like a bunch of thirsty dudes... can't be sure, but I'm pretty sure it's a bunch of dudes. Whatevs, that's just how be these days...
Check the OPs profile and KABOOM! Billy fu**ing Mays!
onlyfans link.
Lewds, nudes, and sissyboi tubes.
Posts to /traps /tgirls /shemales /ladyboys

All that traffic comes to /trans and here we be. 

I shouldn't be so affected by this... But this sub honestly saved my life and breathed new hope and positivity back into my days... So. I'm sad.
Yes. There are so many other places for that sort of thing. Let's not forget this is a place for ALL trans folks. I can't imagine how alienating it must be for our trans MEN having to put up with all these trans girl chasers.
I understand what you mean. I apologize; my comment was vague and poorly composed. Brevity was never my forté.

We're all fucked up inside; it's what makes us quirky and interesting. You seem nice to me. I'll bet you'd totally be a catch.
Yeah I legit would not mind if they were posting in good confidence to feel better etc., but they are fishing for clients and dumping their trash (the chasers) in our spaces for money.

I usually report and block them as spam.

But I always check the profile first, there are some that look a lot like that type of post but the profile and past comments show they are legit here for community.

EDIT:

I also notice that they skirt the rules by posting safe photos in the legit communities to avoid getting banned. They are just gaming the system and it sucks.
>I can't imagine how alienating it must be for our trans MEN having to put up with all these trans girl chasers.

I find it frustrating sometimes, on many levels. Thank you for thinking about us trans guys! :)

To be honest the objectification can be kind of...I don't know, not downright ""dysphoria inducing"" (I'm not trying to say other trans men can't feel this way about this though, they would be *very* valid to, I'm just saying since I don't have genital dysphoria it's not *exactly* that feeling for me), when there's such a *massive* focus on attraction to women with penises, to the near exclusion of basically anything else. It really puts a spotlight on the complicated, sometimes not so awesome relationship trans spaces and queer/bi/pan ones have with AFAB genitals, and *especially* masculine presenting folks with AFAB genitals.

Second it can be kind of annoying because it's like...I've got a long term girlfriend who happens to also be trans, and also happens to be non-op like me. I find myself prefacing *big time* whenever I mention her that I am also a non-op trans man and not a cis guy, just because things around the trans subreddits often get so fetishy and chasery that speaking about us dating or our sex life or whatever, there's a big need to make sure other trans women know that I'm not a cis guy fetishizing the trans femme half of our community, and that we met and fell in love organically, nobody ""chased"" anybody else.

I feel like it's really important to get that out there just because of how *unhealthy* and gross the ""seeking"" of the unrealistic ""fully functional vers/top"" trans woman stereotype is. Both of us have to kind of walk that tightrope between existing as a willingly non-op no bottom surgery couple while also being clear that just because we exist in that fashion does not mean we are any more okay with being objectified and fetishized than a dysphoric trans person would be."	lgst0c	trans	42	0.96	2021-02-10 12:40:34
I’m done hesitating. I’m gonna go forward with medical transitioning	"19NB person here. Literally nobody in my life knows this — not my family, not my friends (who I’m barely out to) but I booked an appointment at planned parenthood today, and I am going to move forward with starting testosterone. I thought since I don’t have anyone to celebrate these victories with, I’d go here :) 

I’ve been wanting to do this since 7th grade, but there was a lot of shame since most of my family is Muslim/transphobic and I never really had anyone to support me. When I started college after trying to push down my dysphoria for 6 years, my mental health spiraled. I know this is going to create so much happiness in my life. I can’t wait to start feeling more comfortable and at-home in my body. I can’t even begin to explain my euphoria in finally doing this for myself!!!"	"It sounds like you've got yourself figured out ☺️

Good luck on your journey ❤️ The rewards for walking this path are incredible.
I’m so proud of you! 🏳️‍⚧️💪
Why were you hesitating? Sounds like you've known what you want for 6 years.

Congrats. I know it’s going to feel so amazing when you wake up the next day on your positive journey! I wish I had your confidence (I’ve locked myself in the closet). No one should be miserable. I hope life gets better for you.
Heck yeah! So far, hormones have been the best decision I've ever made, and I hope it is that way for you as well! Good luck on the journey!
There's a website called Folx healthcare, they make it easy to start and continue hrt

Did you miss the part where I said majority of my family is transphobic? (Not trying to be rude) I was NOT trying to get kicked out and lose my entire family lol
I can’t currently afford a therapist, but I had one in high school for 2 years and she was the first to suggest that I may be dealing with feelings of gender dysphoria. She was a youth LGBTQ therapist. I’ve been wanting this the moment I found out what being trans is. Maybe don’t clock random people online and tell them what they may want and don’t want, you don’t know me lol

4th grader who shamed Texas Republicans for attacking her rights is now getting death threats		"Imagine being so vile as to send a literal child death threats.

Fucking party of ""family values"".
MAN I wish I was even 1% as brave as that kid. If there's one person in this world I genuinely look up to, it's her.
For fuck's sake. I am almost 1000% positive there are more important issues to address (especially in Texas) than denying gender affirming care for minors or discriminating against the trans community - harassing this child is a no go regardless. Unfortunately the concept of compassion, kindness and understanding are lost on a huge swath of this population.
I wish Texas was as cool as I remember as a kid
Sending death threats to a 4th grader? That’s pretty lame if you feel so ashamed that you retort to threatening children or does baby need their diaper changed?
Vile creatures, thats what they are, and they think that they deffend the virtud.
Imagine the mental gymnastics one has to go through in order to think „yes, threatening a child is a good thing, lets do it“.

Why do they even care so much about other peoples business WHICH DOESNT AFFECT THEM IN ANY WAY!
Yeah that’s pretty disgusting im sorry for how my fellow Texans are acting some of us are kinda assholes and it’s not acceptable
Scum that would threaten a young child are the lowest form of life.   This has little to do with politics more to do with being a scumbag.   I have found people like this on the right and left of the political spectrum if you dare to oppose their point of view.  In which case they will happily issue death threats and even resort to bombing anyone or their family who dares to hold a different opinion.    These people need exposing to the authorities regardless of where you stand on this or any other issue.   A civilised society cannot have people that resort to the knife, gun or bomb just because you don’t agree with someone."	mvpmks	trans	39	0.99	2021-04-21 21:14:24
Finding myself at 41	I’m slowly starting to accept myself for who I am inside. With that comes a lot of fear, shame, and anxiety. I’m considering taking the plunge into HRT. I worry what results I will have, and since I’m 41, I feel like it’s almost too late. I worry about family and friends, spouse and kids. Passing in public, and if I even could. Seeing people in these groups has been so uplifting and encouraging.	"it is NEVER too late to be who you are . i understand the stress , worry , and fear that comes with telling loved ones who you are and the fear of going out in public is real , but you deserve happiness . you also feel a lot more comfortable in yourself and things become a lot easier once you accept yourself for who you are . its scary , but its worth it and i believe in you <3
You know what’s fantastic is getting an email with a comment that was deleted. This person is real lucky they’re behind a keyboard.
I feel you. I'm 54, and have been wrestling with the same issues. It's a nice fantasy for now, but the reality of it seems too daunting to actually see it thru.
You can do it be yourself , its not too late
I started HRT at 37. I turn 41 this year and I pass completely. You can do this, sis.
Thank you. I feel like I have pretty feminine features already, but it’s still scary. I’m 6’1, and it’s hard to imagine feeling cute in public after spending 41 years cosplaying as a dude.
i totally get that ! i cosplayed as a woman for 18 years and am struggling with feeling handsome , but we’ll get there and feel how we wanna feel eventually :) my partners mom is 6’2 , tall women are so beautiful ! you deserve to live your truth no matter your age , you got this :)"	u56u97	trans	35	0.87	2022-04-16 20:47:24
Toxic transmasc ppl against each other	"**I’m a trans guy and I’m only speaking from my experience and the transmasc side*** 

I came out and started transitioning in 2013 it blows my mind how toxic the community  is within itself!!! That’s why I step out the community and  not get so involved, it just becomes so draining and toxic. Honestly folks are so mean, rude, and even like gatekeepers to the community when it shouldn’t be that way. Everyone is different and want to transition in the way that is right for them. Trans ppl attacking trans ppl. I recently started posting about my phalloplasty and my experiences so far and it completely breaks my heart how trans ppl attack me because I don’t want the “cookie cutter phallo.” It’s so sad cause I had ppl reach out to me personally saying they want what I want as well but are afraid to post it out of fear of backlash. It’s really sad. Everyone is different, instead of sticking together and working together we fight, attack and compare each other. It’s really draining, not only do I have to fight drs and “prove” things to dr but also fight my own community when all I’m trying to do is put my experience out there, inform ppl and give ppl hope that what you want is not wrong or bad. There is not a wrong or right way of transitioning but your own community seems to want to tell you other wise and then shame you on top of that. It’s heart breaking and exactly the reason why I had many many second thought about posting or being open about my experience with my up and coming phallo. There already is limited information and a lot of misinformation and maybe this one of the reasons."	"Oh my fucking God, yes!! I've had people tell me I'm not acting masculine enough to be a trans guy and because of that, they don't need to respect my pronouns /identity. I don't owe you masculinity. Nobody is allowed to tell you how to be yourself. But apparently that is a hard concept to grasp, even from other trans people. I'm honestly sick of this shit
i find it mostly comes from people craving validation and proximity to cis people and wanting to assimilate rather than acknowledging and embracing the diversity of experience and expression in our communities
I may not be transmasc but I’ve experienced a lot of this toxicity. One of my suite mates in college was transmasc and said that “I wasn’t trans enough” and “was a straight cis male trying to get in with the queers”

My first post-op experience	"Another update to my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/mtf/comments/cfrk2s

And since the mtf sub thought it was erotica... 

Its now been 3 months since my surgery and according to my doctor, i can finally have fun with my new vagina! On my booklet that they gave me to schedule my dilatations for the year and other post-op care information, it said : ""you will need lubrication for vaginal sex""

Ha!

As the day drew ever closer to the 3 month mark, so has the date at which i start going back to work. But even better, so has the date of my wife's birthday. And I have been teasing her for weeks about it. My wife is also trans, but has opted to keep her lovely apparatus intact seeing as she likes it the way it is and is not dysphoric about it as well.

But there is also the fact that prior to me, she was a gay guy and has never been with a woman before. I was going to be her first. Quite the shoes to fill but I was up to the challenge.

I woke up early, thinking I could get my first dilation of the day done ahead of time but something kept me from actually doing it. As I picked up my phone and started browsing Reddit (of course), some very exciting pictures came along in my feed which aroused my body to the point of no return.

I turned to my still sleeping wife and put my arms around her, and my hand in her hair. As I gently woke her up by massaging her hair, i took my other hand and started gently scratching her with my nails, all over her thigh and all the way to her nipple.

I sensed her shifting and grunting more and more as i wrapped her arm around me so I could get even closer to her. I nibbled her tit.

She loves that.

My hands start moving around more and she finally shifts on to her back, allowing me full access. I wrap one leg around hers and move my hand down some more. Our eyes finally meet.

""Good morning"" i said as i squeezed gently.

""hrmmmph.. 'rning"" as her eyes lit up slightly more.

I continued my morning greeting with more fervor until she could take no more and gasped for air.

""Is there coffee?"" she asked as i laid by her side.

""Not yet, I'll go make it... later"" as I grinned to her face. She grinned back.

She turns to her side and opens up the nightstand. Out comes the magic wand and i lay on my back. Despite my best effort, orgasms have been anything but easy for me since that faithful day in June. My wife bought the wand for herself (with attachment) but I wanted to try it out and see if I could get some amount of pleasure out of it.

As she turns towards me, she lays her head on my breast gently and puts the wand on my crotch.

I shutter as she turns it on. She then proceeds to move it around, but I am still too swollen for the wand to work on the surface. I put my hand on hers and start to guide her around as best I can, hoping for a sensation on my end. I eventually find the sensation to be pretty nice on its own and just enjoy the moment. At one point, I had enough.

it was time.

""I want you"" i blurbed out. I knew she understood me as the wand twitched as I said it. So I said It again. She then turns to me and looks at me with intrigue.

The wand is turned off and she nervously but mischievously scoots in front of me and as I spread my legs.

""Are you sure?""

I nodded.

she fumbles around my crotch area, unsure of herself but I can't blame her, I've basically got a personal flotation device instead of a decent woman's vulva.

She tries her best but suggests that i mount her instead. I obliged. We switch positions and ask her if she's ready to beleive me.

""Beleive what?"" she asks me inquisitely.

""That I was telling you the truth about how it feels to be inside a woman.""

She kisses me on the lips.

""Let's find out!""

Sadly, with little feeling around my new vagina, i struggle to put her apparatus inside of me... until I don't.

Her face lit up like I have never seen it before. She shares with me a look that resembles a mix of excitement and pain and a dozen other emotions.

I feel nothing, but I feel everything. I sense her excitement has she grabs my hips and starts to buck hers upward. If only for a moment until she collapses and covers her face in shame.

""What's wrong?""

""I'm so ashamed, i came so fast, you'd think that I bought that wand in order to help me last longer...""

I removed her hands from her face and look her straight in the eyes.

""It's your first time with a woman. And i did kinda worked you up a lot before. Plus, you think that i lasted long my first time??""

She put her hands back on her face, visibly distraught.

""This is a first for both of us. We'll both have to learn each other again.""

She nods, still with both her hands between us, and sighs.

I wiggle my butt on her crotch.

""Do you want try again?""

""I dunno, do you think so?"" she replies as I sense something hard once more.

I once again help her with the alignment but now, things are different. She's in control.

I raise myself up straight, she moans even more. I can feel her bucking more and more and her hand on my hips and waist.

She's really in control now.

So I let go.

For the first time in my life, I'm someone else's to do what they please.

it feels good to let go.

It feels good to have her in me, even if I don't feel anything. The knowledge that this is happening to me is euphoric.

The end (or just the beginning? 😉)"	"this was beautiful, seriously how does this only have 9 upvotes? this is such a not really talked about topic that is described here in intimate detail and brings hope. so thanks it was beautiful

Wow! Such a great read and I am excited for your new adventures! I've always wondered what it would be like after my surgery, and frankly I'm as scared as I am excited. Thank you for sharing!
had a lot more in the r/mtf sub but it got deleted for ""erotica""

Question about deadnaming (from a cis woman seeking the advice of anyone who has a dead name)	"I hope it’s ok for me to post here..  I am not trans and I understand that deadnaming is a trans term.  I just didn’t know where else to ask this.

I used my legal name most of my life until some very public shaming and ostracizing happened.  I was kicked out of my family of choice as well as my family of origin, and lost my job and residential stability.  These events lead me to stop using my legal name everywhere except.. well, for legal purposes like drs and insurance ect. I have not heard it out loud since my birth family disowned me.  My partner just used my legal first name instead of the nickname I have been using and I suddenly felt sick.  I know it wasn’t intentional, but it totally threw me off.  

I’m working through my emotions, but I’d really like to hear from anyone who has experienced someone using a name that just… feels and IS wrong. I wanted to text trans friends, but also don’t want to bring up anyone else’s own discomfort at an inconvenient time for them.  

I feel like the only people who would understand how something like the wrong name can feel this upsetting are my therapist and people who have had a dead name be used by a loved one by accident…. How do you cope?  How do you handle the feeling in the pit of your stomach and the urge to burst into tears when you hear a name that you tried to put to rest?

Please please tell me if I need to delete this or if me asking is in any way offensive.  I feel very confused and upset and a bit vulnerable."	"It's a shitty feeling for sure. What really matters is *why* someone used it and if they know that name is upsetting to you.  Like, a doctor's gonna use it because that's what's on the form. 

If your partner didn't know it's upsetting, you should tell them. If they then decide to use it maliciously, then that's that - them trying to upset you.
You can change your name for whatever reason you want! It sounds like you have some trauma associated with your name tbh. The reason most people don't change their names is because it's expensive and a pain in the ass. You're not appropriating anything
Tbh it's not strictly a trans term, but people may assume you're trans if you use it. If that's not a bother (and not a danger, this is important as well. There is no issue in using it I'd say.
 What you describe is pretty close, feelings included to how it feels when you get deadnamed as a trans person (for me at least). A struggle almost every trans person faces doesn't mean no cis person will ever experience.

As for coping, well, when you're not out to family, you just don't, you take it in the face and try your best to not break down. Or at least not break down visibly. Else there is no miracle, try your best to distract your thoughts for a moment until it calms down worked for me. But a therapist will probably be of way better help than me there tbh.


I suck at comforting people >< but wishing you to heal from it and put this name at rest for good. From a gal also trying to bury one.
You can ask your health are provider to refer to you by your preferred name if they're halfway decent. My spouse hates their legal name, so the front desk updated the profile to reflect that, and they haven't been deadnamed since. And this was almost two decades before they realized they might be trans. I told my doctor's office I was trans and they asked if there was a other name I wanted to be called by and it the doctor made the switch immediately and hasn't used my legal since. Likewise, I had a pharmacist who spotted my first Estradiol prescription and asked immediately if I wanted a preferred name in the system.

As for your partner, you could tell them something like ""hey, call you not call me 'deadname' any more , it's got a lot of painful baggage associated with it. I didn't realize how painful until I heard someone I care very much for use it. ""New name/nickname"" makes me happy, especially when you use it.""

That way, it doesn't come off as accusatory and also will incentivise proper name use!

As an aside, I like to replace the word deadname with ""necronym"" because I'm a dramatic bitch and it sounds *badass*! ^I'm ^a ^dork ^though
i wouldn't necessary call deadnameming a trans term. its more just a name that isn't used for a person anymore and so is called 'dead'. imo.
now the more used u are to being called by that name the less it hurts. but when u go a long time without hearing it what i found helps is just doing the things that u usually do when u feel down for whatever reason. yk like listen to music or eating or playing video games. anything reall. just distracting yourself from it. trying to not let it consume too much of your thoughts and time.
Depending on where you are, you can 100% ask people to use your preferred name without having to give any kind of reason. Doctors, lawyers etc - I'm in the UK, and there are actually guidelines for professions and service providers around this. If you ask to be called an alternative name it's supposed to just be accepted and done.

I see a lot of ppl commenting implying that you have to just accept doctors and other professionals using a 'legal name' but I think that's just a result of the institutionalised bullying and prejudice amongst doctors and such towards trans people. They may insist but they should just be using whatever name the person they're providing a service to asks for, according to their own rulebook.
This happens whenever I go home and it always ruins my first few weeks until I can get used to it or ignore it again, and it’s really upsetting for me. I broke down a few times in my moms car actually and then was more or less forced to go into a bar one of the times afterwards and was extremely unpleasant. 

Hearing someone else with my dead name is also startling for me too. It’s somewhat common so I will be in class or hear it and cringe every time. Never fun.
I've been using my new name full time for a couple months now, including legally. 

But I haven't updated it everywhere, so I've been working on that. ""Hi there, I'm here to update my info with you. You have $birthName in your system.""

 Even me saying my own birth name is painful and awkward now, and I even like the name as it is, it's just no longer mine.

Whenever I hear my new name - and especially the nickname for that - it makes me so happy.
I got deadnamed in front of like 500 people a few days ago at a jazz festival. (It wasn’t the judges fault, he just read the name on the roster,  I had signed up before starting my transition) I got some really bad disphoria, and corrected him. I eventually calmed down by breathing deeply and trying to ignore it.
Do not delete this. You are welcome here 💙. Personally, I feel honored that you came to the trans community for help with this topic. 

I absolutely understand what you are going through. We may have both stopped using our birth names for different reasons, but the reaction you are having is the same I have when someone uses my deadname. It just… feels like a little stab in the gut. 

I would suggest speaking to your partner about this… explain the trauma you have around that name and that you don’t want them using it. If they care for you, that shouldn’t be too hard to ask. You might also wish to consider changing your legal name? You might feel better having your chosen name and legal name match. I know I certainly did…

Best of luck to you 💙 I hope my experience can be of help to you
My parents refuse to call me by my chosen name and insist on calling me my dead name because ""you don't look like a woman why should we act like you are, besides we spent a lot of time trying to pick out the perfectname for you before you were born"" it kills me a little every time they dead name me they barely said my name when talking to me before I came out and told them my new name and it seems like they use my dead name on purpose all the time now
I think I expect it from drs or legal people (when I testified in court).  Maybe I’m braced for it in those settings..  but this was definitely an accident, and I plan on talking about it when they are off work.  It’s honestly never happened before, but I know my partner is very supportive.  

Thank you for the perspective.   I really appreciate it.
Thank you!  I’m a bit hyper vigilant about my words because of the trauma..  but I’m working on it.
Your feedback helps a lot!  Part of me having trouble with the name I no longer use is related to the public nature of events..  I was named on news networks ect because of a legal proceeding that outed very private parts of my life in a high profile matter.  

Honestly, all of the validation that people who are not trans can grieve and be upset about a name connected to difficult circumstances being resurrected.  I think anyone who has had to face the ugly nature of both corporate and social media could experience some difficulty, especially if they marginalized or socially outcast.  It’s refreshing to hear perspectives from those who have shared some common threads even if I am not trans. So much gratitude and respect!

And yes, my therapist and I will have some interesting discussions. But at least I feel less along in the dread.  My heart goes out to trans people for the difficulties they face that are much more complex and varied than deadnaming.  I’m thankful that my inquiry has been met with kindness and empathy.  🙏
I actually giggled at the dramatic version.  I love it.  I needed to laugh.  My partner was very kind and it helped to have some feedback.  Thank you!
Thank you, that really helps.  I didn’t want to appropriate a term that’s not mine to use..  I just don’t know of anyone who has changed their name that’s not trans.  The time frame thing makes sense…. I’m trying to remember that the name that was used doesn’t change me inside but..  it really messed with my head.  I feel like an entirely different person.
Thank you for explaining this.  It’s honestly never even crossed my mind to ask for this.  The UK is ahead of the US…. Especially less liberal parts of the already less liberal US.  Some places are certainly better than others.  

I’ll keep this in mind!
I feel like my name is no longer mine but I use it in paper.. it just feels more like borrowing it because I’m not sure I could change everything ..  it’s confusing.
I really didn’t realize that it could cause panic..  it make so much sense to me now…
Thank you!  The validation really helps..  my partner was really understanding and kind about it and also understood why the name is difficult for me.  I think it got difficult after people spoke about a case I testified in on the news.  Suddenly my legal name became a caricature that was no longer me.  Suddenly I didn’t get to choose who I was out to about my personal life.  As someone who grew up as southern baptist, that became a problem.  I’m not straight and am ethically non-monogamous and Unitarian Universalist. A lot of the old social fabric of my life is gone with my name, done and buried.  I just wasn’t expecting that name to hit me so hard. Thank you so much for your kindness!
That’s so dehumanizing..  😔
I hear ya, getting caught off guard makes a difference, but usually it's an accident. Hell, my mom calls me the family dog's name sometimes :p
I want to also mention that if you want to, there’s absolutely no reason it would be wrong for you to legally change your name to something you prefer. Name changes aren’t just for trans people! 

Hate your birth name, for any reason, you’re allowed to change it.
You're quite welcome, Dear!
I know several not trans people who changed their name and have now a deadname, most because what was associated with their name.
yeah that can be really annoying. but in my experience it should not hold on too long. the feeling i mean
You’re less likely to get pushback if your preferred name is the same gender as your legal name, or an obviously-related nickname, compared to trans people, but yeah. Pretty much everywhere you can at least request a preferred name be entered for you. It’s not possible to *completely* avoid a legal name, but it’s very possible to minimize it!
I've put together a list of things that I've changed and need to change. If you want, I can share it so you can use it as a checklist template.
Of course! And I can totally understand the southern Baptist thing… my wife is an ex-southern Baptist. Seeing as how she is now in a lesbian marriage with a trans woman, I’m sure you can guess how her relations with her parents are 😅.

For me, I feel the same way about my deadname. When I was first transitioning, I told people “oh, it’s fine to refer to past-me as he and [deadname]. That’s how I identified at the time, so it’s fine to use that.” However… as time progressed… I realized how incredibly painful it was for me to hear that name and those pronouns applied to past me. It’s definitely a struggle I understand. 

Best of luck to you in your journey 💙. I’m glad I could be a little help.
This. While in the process of my name change, my wife and I discussed her name too and she realized how much she never liked her name and only kept it because she felt obligated to cuz…society and stuff. That said, we got our name changes together on the same form so that’s great! (For reference I’m trans and she’s cis). She loves her name now and it’s wild the difference it can be for someone.
I would be interested in it, thank you!

Press the button?	"Is the push the button test as good as posters suggest?
You know the one. 'If you could press a button that would permanently turn you in to a woman, would you?'
I would press the button in a heartbeat.

I've been experimenting recently. It sounds silly but I have a skirt and a pink hair clip. I also shaved my, well, body. I realised that each day I stop myself behaving certain ways because ""That's not what men do"" I don't want to do that anymore. I grew up in the late 80s and early 90s and had a lot of my femininity ridiculed, humiliated and shamed out of me but still grew up into an effeminate man.

Thinking I might be trans is very new to me. I used to think I was just an effeminate man.

A few words of wisdom from those who've gone before would be loved and welcomed."	"2017 was my year.  For me there were two big steps, finally admitting to myself I was trans and then figuring out what to do about it.  

A gender therapist can help you figure it out, but they can't decide that for you.  Immersing myself in the 20+ (probably way more now) Reddit trans subs was a huge factor for me.  Seeing common threads I shared with other trans people (not just MtFs) was one of my biggest take aways. 

Once I admitted to myself that I was trans I knew what I needed to do, to transition, but that choice isn't right for everyone and the degree and timing of that transition are different for each of us.  I found the right gender therapist and a supportive endo and made things happen pretty quickly.  It looks like you might be close to my age, so we might have a lot in common.  Feel free to PM me and we can chat if that would help.  Good luck! ☺
It's really good at reframing the question of ""am I trans"" into something that is ""what is your ideal finish line"" and diffusing any stress by creating a hypothetical situation where there is no cause for anxiety (which is why it is my go-to response to most times when ""am I trans"" is asked).
> ""That's not what men do""

I understand this sentiment but I'm wary of applying preconceived notions of what being a woman means to you taking control the way in which you live your life. There are things that I enjoy that are conceived as being ""things men do"" - playing guitar, video games.. 

I don't know I just think it's good to be conscious of how the way in which you present your femininity speaks about what being a woman means to you. 


Unfortunately there is no 'button', no instant miracle transformation process. Quite the opposite in fact. I think I can assure you if there were, most gender dysphoric persons would have pressed it years ago.

Instead one is faced with months, if not years, of therapy, hormone and other treatments. On top of that you have a minefield of bureaucracy getting all your documents changed to reflect you new role. Then one has to learn all the skills that a female needs to go about her daily life. If you are up for all of this remembering there is no magic button, then welcome to the club. 😀 xxx
There were a lot of small things that lined up that made it overwhelming for me not to acknowledge that, yes, I am trans and need to start working towards transition.  I feel like the button was pushed for me.
>""That's not what men do"" 

Who says? ""Men don't wear skirts"" I do, and I'm a man. ""Men don't sew or cook"" I do. ""Men don't shave their body"" I do.

There are a lot of things that men ""don't do"" or *didn't* do, that is now becoming acceptable.

The trick is, in your own mind, to decide why you might want something that is usually described as ""feminine"" and if it should even be described as feminine. This is the other side of what is starting to be described as ""toxic masculinity.""

It is difficult sometimes to tread the fine line between becoming a fully decent human, and rejecting all the fine things that it means to be a man. In the same way, a lot of women are feeling their way to being regarded as competent in traditionally male roles while still behaving and feeling like the woman they are and want to be.

If I had ""the button"" and it worked, would I try it? Yes, if it was reversible, and it was pre set at a defined period. e.g. You get to live as a woman for a week, then you convert back, and you can't do it again for another month. Thing is, I've no objection, theoretically, to being a woman, but I have no attraction to the male genitalia, but if I pressed the button, would my hormones alter that? And would it be...fair(?) to my male self to alter that? I've heard some crossdressers and trans individuals describe themselves as ""A lesbian in a man's body"" but that isn't me, I have a penis, and like using it in the way it was intended. On the other hand, I don't want a ""traditional"" relationship, me the breadwinner with submissive little wifey at home. That isn't a swipe at anybody, and I know a lot of those ""traditional"" relationships are nothing of the sort once you get to know the people involved.

Experimenting is cool, that's what I'm doing myself to a certain extent, and so far the results have been interesting and generally very positive. I'm accepted at work in a skirt, though I think a few took a little while to figure out what *they* thought about it. The funny thing is that I feel more confident, and therefore more masculine.

I'm fortunate that I live in a country that is generally very tolerant, and in particular working for a company that is serious about discrimination rules. If you can do some experimenting without putting yourself, your job, or your relationships at risk, do so if that's what you want, and don't feel guilty about it.
Thank you for the offer. I might PM you if I feel brave enough. It's new and a bit scary for me to talk about it at all. It would be great to have someone to talk with.
I'm 35 years old and think it's understandable that I don't know what it means to be a woman.
I believe that I've been led to think this way because it's only stereotypical female behaviour that caused people to make fun of me.
I'm not going to let these concerns control me anymore. I'm just going to do what makes me feel happy.
this is so important 
The offer stands...with no time limitation...so the timing is totally up to you...next week...next month...next year.☺

Being true to yourself	"How often have you been told *You need to be true to yourself *? For me it’s been countless times and I never understood it. Hearing the phrase was quite frustrating.

Last weekend I had an opportunity for the first time in my life after 50 years, where I was able to explore my gender identity without guilt,  shame or the fear of being caught doing something in secrecy.  

My wife discovered my stash of clothes 19 months ago and I discovered I’m a transgender AMAB a year ago tomorrow. She forced me to discard everything I had accumulated. This period of time was by far the most difficult of my life.

Last weekend  I traveled to a city and was staying in a hotel. Realizing that I’d have time to myself, I ended up buying a dress, bra and forms, jewelry, makeup and more beforehand. I told my wife my plans. It didn’t go over well but I forged on.

I got to the hotel and I dressed. I did my makeup. I did my nails. And then I sat there. In the silence it finally hit me, *I need to be true to myself!*  Sitting in a hotel room hiding who I’m struck me as so profound. Sure, my wife knew what I was doing. I wasn’t sneaking around anymore but sitting there made it feel like a fetish, something to be shameful of. I just wanted to scream out to the world this is who I’m am! Please accept me. I realized dressing in a glorified closet would never be enough!

I got home and was wearing a necklace that I bought for the occasion. It was closer to feminine than gender neutral.  The first time I put it on, in the hotel, the euphoria was amazing. Wearing it all weekend and feeling it shift as I moved was a gentle reminder of the woman I’ve concealed from the world and myself since I was 5 years old. That night, I saw a disgust in my wife’s eyes as I attempted to come close to her. She eventually said she couldn’t take me wearing the necklace. In that moment, her reaction cemented my newly found realization, *I need to be true to myself* but was crushed because I also realized that my wife doesn’t want me, she wants the man she married 36 years ago. 

I realize now that I do need to be true to myself but doing so isn’t easy. I know I could fall back into the compromises life that I’ve led but I just can’t any longer. I’ve opened up the bottle and unable to put the genie back in. I now know I don’t want to."	"You go my sister, for all of us there’s a point in our life where we can’t turn back, and unfortunately not all of the people around us can accept as the ones we truly are. They prefer the mask forged of lies that they have gotten accustom to. But know that there is a whole huge family out there who loves and accepts you
i'm really proud of you for coming to this realization!! it takes a huge amount of bravery to look at yourself and say ""fuck all the expectations i have to do this."" that's a powerful move girl, good luck in your journey!!!
OMG! 🦋 This is such a beautiful story, and by a beautiful woman!  I'm so proud of you Leaona for stepping out of your shell, and were finally able to be true to yourself. 🦄

> I realized dressing in a glorified closet would never be enough!

You're an inspiration to us all. I didn't have the nerve to do what you did until 3 or 4 months after starting HRT. Sure, I underdressed for years,  but walking out in public as my true self took a lot longer than it did for you.  💝💝💝💝  I spent many, many months sitting on my sofa dressed up, but too afraid to go outside. Thankfully, one day the nerve just showed up, and I haven't looked back since.

It’s been a difficult lesson and I don’t think I’ve paid all of the tuition as of yet for what I’ve learned. I appreciate the support."	er1sgt	trans	31	0.97	2020-01-19 20:31:12
73 and still only half out	I've had dysphoria and depression all my life. Knew I was supposed to be a girl when I was 4 years old. Completely dressed for the first time when I was 8.  If I had a choice I would prefer being around girls. I lactated when I was 10 years old (freezing cold 8 degree walk to school and my t-shirt was wet, sticky and crusty around my nipples). Didn't get secondary sex characteristics until I was almost 17. Parents were not accepting and did everything in their power to keep me masculine. Shaming, verbal abuse, and beatings. I caved in to their biases and grew up as a man. I'm 6' and 225lbs. I'm  a veteran, I've worked a lot of dangerous jobs. I got married to the most wonderful woman, who I told about my gender issues before we were married. She accepted and sometimes participated, but was always supportive. We had 2 children. We were both successful at our careers. So, basically I fit my round peg in a square hole for all of my adult life. My wife died 2 years ago this week. Two people in my family know about my trans self. I have a few friends that I have come out to this year. I have been out in public many times, have been to Southern Comfort twice, and Eurika Springs twice. So I have not been completely in the closet. All of this is just to say the dysphoria never goes away. You need to find your comfort level with it and be yourself as best as you can. Oh and have PRIDE in your uniqueness!!	"Bless you sweetheart, that’s a very moving post. Good luck to you. Peace. Paige 💕
Everyone has their own journey. Some are longer than others. Some never finish. Stay the course. Even a small step moves you forward.
bless your heart!! i hope you can fully come out soon!!!!! 💖💖
I'm sorry to hear about your wife, I hope you can feel fully accepted soon! We're all proud to be in the same community as a person as brave as you!
Thank you for the kind words. I do miss her, but the pain lessens with time. I don't feel particularly brave as much as I feel persistent and somewhat stubborn 😉. I can now live my life the way I want.
I'm glad to hear that! :)"	nr2hvv	trans	31	1.0	2021-06-03 02:14:31
I don’t feel happy or proud that I came out of the closet.	"It’s been a little over a month since I came out. I honestly feel like I’ve killed myself. I feel like I destroyed everything I worked for. Relationships, dreams, hopes all of it. All without considering all that work that it took. And all because I don’t feel okay living in my body all because it’s a male body and I’m not male. I feel guilty and gross and like a freak. I feel extreme shame and I loathe myself for not saying something sooner, before life got in the way. I hate that I couldn’t figure it out when in retrospective it was all so obvious. I could have lived my life as my true self sooner without all the collateral damage. I thought coming out would be freeing but instead I feel worse than I did before. Now I can’t take it back I can’t go back into hiding and pretend everything is gonna be okay. I can’t suppress the feelings like I used to. I’m scared for my future I’m scared that I fucked all up by just trying to be happy.

Sorry long rant but I just needed to get it out."	"Same, I’m afraid that by choosing me, I’ll ruin not just my life but my wife’s and then mess up the relationships that I’ve cultivated over many years and it’s terrifying.
34 mtf. I just came out to my GF and I feel exactly the same way. Like, it's so fucking scary...what now? I did the thing I've been afraid of doing (told another human), but now what? People are still going to think i'm a freak and insane. I still can't come out to my family because they would just invalidate me and make me feel suicidal, or at least my mom would. I still don't know how to transition. I definitely don't know how to explain what I'm feeling or why I'm feeling it. My GF is super supportive so I have that going for me, but I can tell she is afraid of me transitioning to living as a woman because she is straight. I feel like I'm just going to ruin this fucking perfect relationship and disappoint everyone who has ever known me, as I unfortunately have zero trans friends."	woewmr	trans	32	0.96	2022-08-14 19:45:31
A coming out letter to my mum (need opinions)	"I am your daughter.  I always have been but I was the daughter who was told she was a man, expected to participate in men’s activities, expected to act like a man, dress like a man, groom herself like a man.  

Who looked into the mirror every day and knew she was ugly, who looked at her mum and then her sisters and wanted nothing more then to be just as beautiful even just a little 😔

When she went into school and had to use male bathrooms she felt embarrassed and scared she felt naked like everyone could see who she really was, locker rooms became a source of anxiety and distress, she never felt she could be herself, she felt scared and upset and all she wanted to do was run away.

The daughter that could never be herself who thought she was an embarrassment so did just what was expected of her and went back into hiding.

The daughter who woke up every morning feeling like her body was missing bits that this thing she was in wasn’t hers and then was forced through one transition when her body tried to reinforce the idea she was a man by making her have testosterone, but even after that she still knew it wasn’t right.

The daughter who met people who she saw a future with who had crushes she thought she wasn’t allowed to have, to have dreams of relationships with people who never really saw her who she couldn’t even touch for fear of being called gay or a freak.

The one person I should of trusted was you; but I was the most terrified of losing you, I thought I would have no one that I would be truly alone and because of that I never gave you a chance I am truly sorry for that maybe it could of been different for us both.

All my life I’ve been in distress unable to vocalise how I felt because of shame, embarrassment my own transphobia because of films like ace Ventura I thought how I felt was something to be ashamed off a “fake” girl trying to “trick” cis people and it took me a very long time to get over that. Actively trying to deny who I am by using my self critic to reinforce every negative thing I ever heard about myself or trans people.

All I want to do now is be the girl I was always meant to be, as beautiful on the outside as I am on the inside. To live a life I’m proud of,  to be unashamed of being myself.

I am your daughter, my name is Lily Anne and I love you so very much."	"[deleted]
I love the name Lily Anne! You’re so brave and I hope everything goes well as you come out to your mother!
Awww precious Adorabean that’s soooooo sweeeeet! Proud of you no matter what!
I believe in you ❤️. You can do this. I am sure that your mom will love you for who you really are. It takes a lot of courage to come out. I can tell that was wrote from the heart and I am sure your mom can tell too. Good luck ❤️
Quick update
I gave it her and she messaged me back later saying she was super proud of me, thanks for helping me kind strangers
I think its beautiful, though in some points it sounded like it could have been a suicide note.  I'm not sure how to fix that, but maybe be aware of that in your presentation, or add some sort of preface? Maybe in the first paragraph add something about how you are finally taking steps to fight back or live comfortably or something implying that you have a future?
I do have an intro but it was kind of personal and had some information I didn’t want to share but this is the main body.

I’ll definitely sort out the punctuation before I give it her.

Thanks for the feedback!
Thank you very much ❤️
I can definitely see where your coming from and I do have a short intro but also I’m really trying to put into words my feelings and that’s not easy to do and to show the joy that this journey will bring me I feel I have to show the pain of how I got here in the first place to show her this is who I am, not a choice I’m making.

Hope this made sense ❤️

Edit: oops meant this as a reply to the person who said it had a Suicide note vibe, definitely don’t want to hurt myself I want to live now more then ever 💕"	l8nhwj	trans	30	1.0	2021-01-30 15:04:31
"Sometimes, I feel like an idiot for defending transgender people and the trans experience. Because transphobia is ""okay"" since ""it's just facts"" to a lot of people. Sometimes, I forget that we're NOT subhuman and we DESERVE to be treated equally and with respect. ...I could use a reminder, please."	"***TW: Transphobia, Negative Internal Thoughts, Trans Doubts, Other...***

\-x-

Please don't take this the wrong way. I beg you. 

I just need help... A reminder, a lift of spirits, a thumbs up, I don't know. Just, something to help me out, here.

My ranting in this post, hopefully, will aid in getting things off my chest. I apologize *profusely* if you're hurt, offended, or angered by what's said in this post. It's not my intention to do such things to you. Please be safe.

\-x-

I'm not new to transphobia. I've been out since I was ten, over a decade as I'm turning twenty-three in exactly two weeks time. So, you'd think I'd be used to this by now, yeah? That transphobia rolls off my back by this time...

Usually, it does.

For some reason, today, it has not.

I was on a relatively popular subreddit earlier this morning, just scrolling through, when there was a post that asked, ""Straight guys, would you still be 'straight' if you dated a *transgendered* woman?""

Naturally, my answer would be ""no"". And naturally, I think people can identify however they wish to. When I saw misinformed commenters saying ""that ain't straight"" or ""hell nooooo you're not straight if you date a dude"", I rushed in to defend these hypothetical people. I wasn't saying anything rude, not anything aggressive, just giving my opinion on the matter and telling these commenters that people can identify how they wish, and since *they* aren't dating this hypothetical transgender woman, why should they get a say in how the couple defines their sexuality?

I was then told, ""You're so brainwashed, it's sad.""

At first, it didn't bother me. But after more back-and-forth (something I'm sure you can find in my comments history since it was just a few hours ago, if you *really* want to read the since-deleted post), I...had some intrusive thoughts.

'What if they're right?'

'What if I'm just seriously mentally ill, and being trans is mental illness?'

'What if I'm not actually trans?'

'What if everyone who's told me I'm sick, or stupid, or deranged, or am no better than an anorexic starving themselves, is right?'

For a bit, I tried to remind myself that *anyone* would crack under the pressure of abuse, that gaslighting makes *anybody* think they're in the wrong when, in fact, they're not. And for some time, I tried to remember that I'm perfectly content and *happy* with my gender and my identity before transphobes come in, and they're just making my doubt myself. Because I feel so normal and so *good* with myself on an average, everyday basis.

But then those thoughts come back. Over, and over, and over.

Suddenly, shame comes over me, because I'm embarrassed that I tried to defend trans people. ""Maybe I *am* brainwashed."" I think. ""God, I look like an absolute fucking *moron* to them."" And not just the commenters, but others, too, because I hit negative downvotes pretty easily.

...I don't know where I'm going with this, admittedly.

Every time I feel happy with myself, and happy about my life, something else comes swooping in to knock me flat on my ass. It's not always transphobia like this, of course. This time, it just so happens to be. And this time, it's really fucking me up, for some reason. Making me doubt everything I felt okay about.

I'm just tired.

How do I help myself? Help myself heal, and be okay with who I am? I need my thick skin back, but healing from traumas requires you to become emotionally squishy so you can regain your sense of self that may have been lost due to drawing into yourself. So, how can I be okay with me if people *hate* me?

I know I'm supposed to have...*pride* over who I am, over *what* I am, but I don't. I don't, because everyone who beats me down with their words seem right to me, now, and everyone who stands up for trans people look like ""crazy liberal snowflakes"", in my eyes. The internalized transphobia is a cancerous growth in my chest, and no matter how many times I try to remind myself, tell myself, and *prove* to myself that those assholes are wrong about me, I just... It doesn't work...

\-x-

Below is more of me rambling, unrelated to this post and being trans. You can ignore it if you want since it's not pertinent to the above situation, but I just didn't have the heart to delete it. It's more ""woe is me"" shit, so really, it's just...whatever.

>!There hasn't been a day that's gone by where I haven't fought. Decades of abuse - sexual, physical, emotional, and mental - that began the day I was born, have seemingly worn down on me, weathering my resolve.!<

>!My mom said I was born with fire in my veins; I had to have been, because she was sick with cancer while pregnant with me, and I was supposed to be dead upon birth or, at most, severely mentally and physically handicapped.!<

>!But I wasn't. I'm okay.!<

>!I survived just to experience a decade of childhood sexual assault from multiple people, abuse from my own family and friends, bullying for nearly twenty years of schooling, seething self-hatred from both society and from myself for being weird, and trans, and so many other things...!<

\-x-

**TL;DR - How do you overcome self-hatred and internalized transphobia when society's majority keeps shoving it onto you? How do you keep standing up when you just end up getting knocked down, again, and again, and again?**"	"All I can say is the internet is a disgusting place. People hurl insults and say things without even thinking about what it means, or how it could hurt someone. 

I try to stick to trans subreddits where I'm with my own like-minded people. I suggest the same for you. Or at least avoid obvious harmful posts like the one you mentioned. 

I also like to remind myself on how stupid CIS people are when it comes to trans topics. CIS people think we're crazy because they are comfy in their own identity and don't feel how we feel. You can't expect them to know how we feel and what we go through. They know nothing because they don't experience what we do. They say, ""oh yeah, I'd never like a transwoman, that's gay!"" They see them as sex objects and not for the brave, incredible and amazingly beautiful women they are. And frankly those types of CIS people aren't worth your time of day. (Because a real trans person wouldn't even fuck them to begin with, lol)

I actually went through a period myself after browsing a very dark and very heavy transphobic thread thinking I was delusional and ill too. But I talked to my doctor about it and he said that trans people certainly aren't delusional. And he's right. 

Nobody would give HRT, surgeries or even provide trans rights to kids if we were delusional. We're not. We're simply people who are working towards who we truly are on the inside, and it doesn't make us any less of a person. I actually think trans people are some of the bravest and strongest. We learn so much, and change so much. Like a fucking butterfly! (Lol) It takes metaphorical BALLS to realize who you are, and to decide you're going to do something about it! 

If you feel like you're a woman, YOU. ARE. A. WOMAN. If you feel like a man, YOU. ARE. A. MAN. It doesn't matter how you dress or act. You are you. And you're fucking beautiful. 

You're obviously going through really heavy stuff right now. I can't give advice for your past or things with your mum. (Therapy, therapy, therapy.) But we can only keep on being ourselves. I'm here if you need to chat, O.P. Though I don't know how much I can help. At the end of the day I think it's most important to just be your true self and do it unapologetically. You'll always run into assholes, even within the trans community. It's just a sad fact. You need some good friends to lean on when down, and funny things to read when hurting. (I literally LIVE for transgendercirclejerk. Funniest shit IMO and watching them mock shitty CIS people always makes me feel better.)

I love you, O.P. ♥️
Sometimes I feel this way too because of how much transphobia is pumped around us. It makes me feel absolutely horrible and disgusted with myself when I find myself ""agreeing"" with shit used specifically to hurt me. However, I'm aware that they're stemming from internalised transphobia that may pop up ironically BECAUSE of dysphoria.

Think about it though, these are *cis* people's opinions and rhetorics. Here's a reminder: we're human beings. We are beautifully diverse in so many ways. There's no right or wrong when it comes to expressing gender and sexuality. All sorts of contact and intimacy we have with other human beings is just that — contact. It is NOT dictated by the way our body looks or what we're born as.

Next, we invented the concept of gender. Chromosomes are real, and they go beyond XY and XX, too! But gender is a *social* construct and not a biological fact. People aren't born knowing whether they're men or women until these concepts are introduced to them at a young age; it is after we learn what gender is that we understand what we're feeling. What we describe as gender is a certain inner feeling that *does* exist but I'm not gonna go into the specifics right now, it's just that society has defined it the way it did and that it ended up causing issues like sexism, and it is the root of dysphoria.

I repeat, we all express ourselves differently. Forget gender for a second. Imagine a world without gender. I'm sure every person, cis or trans, would still want to express themselves the way the currently want to, whether it's wearing a dress or doing this or that. So think about: transphobes are weirdos in this case. Do you see where I'm going with this?

Sometimes I believe what they say. Sometimes I worry that I'm a delusional deviant for existing. Sometimes I worry that they are right about the brainwashing thing, so I remind myself of the stuff I said above. I might believe the words that go along ""you're having pride over being a disgusting unusual freak"" but they're not true! You deserve kindness, so please treat yourself gently. To relieve yourself for a moment, think of your identity in terms of how you want to express yourself as a human being instead of in terms of gender or physical attributes, maybe that would help a bit.
*virtual hug*




I sometimes feel this way, like maybe this is the best elaborated cult but when i look back and read the stories i know im in the right place. 




Im used to deal with misinformed people it is what it is, i consider myself very logical and i think other persons who are teached about trans persons will think the same as me




It is definitely a shock all mental difficulties are hard to get a grasp on because is not really tangible you have to hear it with strong conviction from multiple sources cause at first its easy to dismiss it as crazy talk. But we are here we are real our memories and feelings are there, im sure one day every one will understand cause you can't change what you are,
Hey I definitely do not have all the answers here but one thing I can say is that you deserve some kindness - from others, but especially from yourself.


Me personally I try to stay out of online arguments. I find even if I'm right I still feel like shit afterwards.
Heyyyy.
I'm so sorry about how you are feeling.
Some people suck, that's all I can say. Other comments on this very post would put it much better than I ever could.

I will remind you that you deserve respect, we all do. All we want to be is ourselves, and we take crap about it from people who dont have the capacity to understand.

Nothing we can do will prove our validity to them. We deserve better. You deserve better. You're great. I hope this helps. *hug*
Those assholes receive their talking points from organized groups dead-set on keeping the trans community in the shadows, not allowing us to be empowered like the gay folks have been recently.  Of course they ""make sense"", that's the point of their operation.  Stand strong and don't fall for it.
Being transgender, to me, is like being intersex. Your characteristics don't match. Your mental view of your sex and gender doesn't match how your body developed. It is biological in nature, just like being born intersex is.

The mind is just as real as the body and is influenced just the same. I mean, look at different conditions. One I can think of where something physical impacts something mental is fragile X syndrome. One of the X chromosomes is different, and it leaves a mental impact on the baby (usually described as learning difficulties). My sister has this. It shows that physical things can affect how your mental state presents itself. And honestly, what other explanation is there than that transness comes from something physical that altered the way your mental state was formed? Maybe it was hormones in the womb. Maybe it was genetic. Maybe both. Who knows, but I do know that being trans is not a choice, and is medical in nature.

And with this in mind, there's only 2 theoretical treatments.

1: would be to change the mental landscape to match the body, which is what conversion therapy has tried to do and has failed consistently, every single time, and only caused more harm. So that's not an option.

2 is to change the body to match the mental landscape, through surgery or hormones or whatever else you please. This has been shown to work time and time again, yet somehow we are still not provided it very easily.
you have to remember that 99% of what people hear about trans people is misinformation spread by malicious people in positions of power. before my egg cracked, I thought trans women were gross, didn't know that hrt was even a thing, and I thought it was just a fetish. flash forward to now, I know better, but only because I've done my research and confided in mine and others' experiences. most people just repeat what they hear, and it's just downright sad because it's really not their fault, they've just been fed lies by people that want to hurt us

Coming out to wife	I'm thinking of coming out to my wife tonight (MTF) and was wondering if I could get some advice on how to start the conversation. I'm terrified but I know she'd be understanding. I know the fear is from my trauma growing up a conservative fundamentalist evangelical pastors kid but I don't know how to overcome the shame that overwhelms me when I try. I've tried a few times already but I just freeze. Any advice would be so very appreciated.	"Say there’s another woman its me but that depends on the tone of the conversation it just seams like an ice braker when i came out I wrote letters so i don’t know conversation wise
My wife and I have good communication, so a few weeks after my egg cracked I mustered up the strength to tell her. I stated it matter of factly like. How it happened. I told her I had been on Reddit trying to learn more about the LGTBQIA community so I could be a better ally, but I connected with so many of the stories of people realizing their AGAB not matching their gender identity. I then went into experiences, and thoughts I had which connected with these stories. In my case I currently identify as non-binary leaning trans femme. So in my case I also have chosen to medically transition. I hope my story helps give you some confidence . But my advice is to talk it out, maybe give her a rundown of how you figured yourself out. And as I have read and know for myself, it’s an ongoing process to learn who you are. Good luck!! Best wishes.
So this may not be the most helpful but I had found a small bra that fit me, I put it on and called my wife into the bedroom and said “look how great this bra looks on me,” followed with “by the way we should talk.” It took some tension out of the conversation but ymmv with this approach.
My wife was very supportive, but we seem to be no longer together. Best friends will need to do until that’s obvious not the case.
My wife and I went for a walk at a lake in the middle of the winter. While walking holding hands, I said: “I would like to talk to with you about something….” She was curious and we were still walking lovingly holding hands. I said: “I have somehow discovered my feminine side and would like to discover it more…”

This is how it started. 

After that we talked A LOT. Really, really, A LOT…

When we had met the first time, my wife and I had talked for days… we had spent days without seeing anyone else and just talking - each of us about themselves… after I came out to her, it was the same… we talked … and yes, there were tears - on both sides.

But seven months in, we are as happy together as never before… my wife also discovered some new sides on herself.

But, then again, YMMV.
I feel your pain hun, I’m in the exact same situation. Let me know how it goes. 💖🥰🏳️‍⚧️
When I first tried telling my partner, I was a bundle of nerves and kept chocking when trying to bring it up. So instead, I wrote her a letter that explained everything I wanted to say, and when I was ready, I sat down, gave her a hug, and handed her the letter, saying ""please read this til the end, then we need to talk"". She wasn't happy, but at least it answered most of her questions before she needed to ask them, and it gave her time to read it, process it, and think about what to do or say next.

Good luck with your journey x
My dad was also a pastor and I came out a few months ago to my wife. Be prepared for her to be shocked and overwhelmed. She might not want a ton of extra info at first. Don’t wait till too late, she may need to call a friend for support or to leave momentarily. Good luck!

You're literally describing what happened to me. This helps so much! thank you!
From someone who started transitioning 8-9 years into a relationship with my fiancée, don’t get discouraged or feel bad about yourself if they need time to process and/or scared of the unknown. 

My fiancee, despite being 100% supportive, still had all sorts of emotions at first, but we are the happiest we have ever been now that both of us are embracing who we want to be as people."	vr8mps	trans	29	1.0	2022-07-04 14:27:15

Cried buying makeup for the first time while being shamed and eyed up.	"I live in the UK, and recently I discovered a truth about myself: I'm a woman. This was a big revelation for me and my girlfriend has been supporting me and making me feel feminine and it's been amazing and so euphoric. I decided I'm going to face my fears today and go into Superdrug with her and buy some makeup.

As I entered the store, it felt normal, because ""men"" walk in with their girlfriends all the time. But as I started to show more interest, starting asking questions to my girlfriend, I started getting really funny looks. At first it just felt uncomfortable, but more and more staff kept eying me up, I heard some women laughing while looking at me. I thought it was me so with a lump in my throat I ask my girlfriend ""is it just me or is everyone making fun of us?"" She said she could feel it too. I got some of the things and she offered to stand in line to pay for it as I made a quick exit out the door. I am still thinking about this event and I have cried multiple times, I started questioning my identity and if this is truly who I am, that I should be feeling happy. But instead I felt shit, awful, it's never been more apparent that I am a presenting man than in that moment and I hate it. I just thought I'd share (for those wondering, it was in Superdrug)"	"Hey sister. Don't worry, such starts are sadly not unheard off. Let me tell you my story, I think I can relate :).

At the time, I was still presenting male (the last 2 weeks of doing so.) I went into the store with a good budget. First few things were easy. Anitranspirant? Just took the pink one. A new comb, sure I had long hair. But then it came to make up. I stood in front of that corner for like 10 minutes and had no idea. Then I went to one of the women working there and explained my situation. First she came over but then called a colleague to help me and my first reaction was ""not so loud pls!"" cause I saw the stares, especially later because there were cis women who needed help from the lady who was explaining like everything to me for the first 15 minutes or so. With bit of a buzzing head I got like 6 items and had 2 call her 2 times more because I needed help with concepts like hydrating creme. It was super awkward. But when I finally went out, I was clutching my bag with the stuff. Really stressful, all the looks, all the information ^^.

Funnily enough, in lighter version ls, I had like the same experience multiple times now in a smaller store closer to me. Its gotten to the point here I selfironically go to the woman who runs the place when she is there like ""hey its me, the baby trans, this time I need help with x"". And we kinda just both accepted that I'm a bit of a special needs customer ^^.
Unfortunately there's a lot of shitheads out there that'll mock and deride that which they don't understand or cannot empathize with. I'm sorry that you had to go through that, and unfortunately I have no good advice outside of ""fuck em."" All we can really do is put on a poncho and let the hate and mockery roll off us.

Just remember, you've got an incredibly supportive and loving girlfriend, and your journey is just starting, sometimes a book has a rough first or second chapter before it gets to the good stuff later on.
Another tragic tale from TERF Island!

Sorry for the clown parade. I'm glad your girlfriend was there for you. I'd be lost if it wasn't for my wife. I think you're really brave for going out like that. I still haven't worked up the courage to go out myself. My wife wants to take me clothes shopping soon, and I hope I don't have to deal with a bunch of goobers. I'm about 50/50 between running away and losing my cool. I'm hoping I run away.
Fuck superdrug, boots all the way.

I'm kidding, I know that doesn't help in the slightest. Sucks that happened and I'm sorry to hear it, hopefully it'll get easier when shops aren't all empty and everyone will just blend in a little more.
Don't let it get you down. Society is broken and hence very judgemental since they are not ready for anything that is out of there ""default"" gender norms, but know it won't be long before things get better for you personally and for all of us trans people. And you know, your girlfriend is there to keep you safe. Here's the English translation of my personal favorite comfort song that should make you feel better and I think vibes with your situation alot. If you want, I can link to the original song if you care to listen to it in the original language.

Any advice for someone who regrets transitioning?	" 

This is my first time posting, but also my first time finally admiting to myself and others what I've been thinking and feeling for a long time, I beg for understanding and advice, I'm in a very vulnerable state and the only think I want is to be understood.

I'll tell my story first, I was born female, I had a good childhood and when I was 13-14 years old my breast developed too fast and they were too big for my age, it starting getting the attention of men, many of them way older than me and that scared me and made me hate and feel shame for my body, later I found out I was homosexual.

I wasn't a very femenine girl, but also not a butch, I dated a few girls, it was all nice and good, but I kept hating that part of my body, and I started hating every part of it with time. Talking to other LGBT people introduced me to the trans comunity and made me think like I was part of it.

I wanted to change this body forever, get rid of my breast, have a new face, be treated differently, not like an inferior person forever just because I was born female. So I came out, and surprisingly my parents supported me after some talks, I told them the usual thing ""I've always felt like this"" ""this is not who I really am"" They understood.

At 18 years old I finally got my mastectomy, what I always wanted, a flat chest, using shirts and not seeing awkwards, annoying bits, I thought I was going to turn into the person that I wanted to be.

I started T a year later, that's when this hell started.

My voice changed in a matter of weeks, but the inner voice in my head never did, it was still my feminine soft voice, not the new stranger male voice that I heard when I spoke, it freaked me out, like it was another person taking control of my body, I started changing and I started realizing that I was hating it all, the body hair, the curves turning into straight lines, I wanted to stop, but everyone was so proud of me, I felt like I would betray them if I do.

Life didn't got more exciting, but people treated me differently.

I thought I wanted the men benefits but I don't, the way men treat me with the respect they almost never did when I was a woman makes me want to go back to being a woman, I feel like I'm in the wrong side, like I crossed a line that I was never supposed to cross, like I completely fucked up my life, I feel more trapped than ever, I don't want to be seen as a guy anymore, but if I tell them to address me with female pronouns while my voice is this thick, they'll laugh.

I want to erase all this and start again, I want my life and my body back, I want to go back to being a lesbian, to have lesbian relationships and enjoy that warm comfort in knowing we're both girls loving each other, I wish I appreciated it more, I wish I thought it better and realized that my relationships were going to be straight from the moment I turned into a man, that I was going to be stuck in the male role forever. I'm so scared because I don't want it.

My second worst mistake was putting all my hopes and effort into this, because now I have nothing, I don't know who I am, what I'm going to do with my life, what I'm going to be, I lied to everyone incluiding myself and I'm just realizing it now, when it's too late.

I need some advice because I'm feeling like I'm going to drown, like I have nothing left.

I wish I loved myself enough to know that I didn't need all those changes to be happy, that not being feminine didn't mean I was a man, now I feel like I'm never going to be happy again."	"I can't help you with that, but I hope you stay well and find yourself. And maybe someone here in the sub can give you a way to that. Good luck ❤️
Hey, it's going to be okay. It's not the end of the world. The purpose of transitioning is to become a more transparent you, and sometimes the person you thought you were isn't what you actually want. I can't give you any definitive advice, and I definitely believe you should talk to a professional about this, but I will say that I think whatever happens is okay. It's all a part of your journey. Detransitioning is not a failure, and you're not going backwards if you decide to do it.

To give you some hope about your voice, you can train it to resonate higher, which is what us trans girls do. It may not sound exactly like your old voice, but it will sound feminine.

(Dafuq are these other insensitive comments??)
Heya. Like some of the others said, it's going to be ok. I'm not sure whether it applies to you right now, but one bit of advice is that whenever you're feeling especially bad, don't decide anything. Feel what you're feeling, do whatever you helps you in that moment, but keep decision for the next day. Because the way you see the world is heavily influenced by someones mood. 

The next thing is that I think your way forward might be very similar to the way MtF trans people go. It might even be somewhat easier.
In any case, talk to a professional, talk to someone you trust and I'm sure there are more people like me who are willing to chat with you.

Cry your tears and then find your next step
Thank you everyone for your answers, even those who laughed at me or weren't very nice, I guess this is the kind of reactions I'll have to get used to get from now, especially from other trans. 
I appreciate a lot all the advices, and I'll do my best to get better.
You're not alone. May I suggest /r/detrans? They might have more advice and help for you.
Therapy.

"" I lied to everyone including myself  "" If ever there was a lesson on the importance of being honest, this is it.

How many doctors and healthcare professionals did you have to fool, and for how long?
Thank you, I didn't know there was a specific topic for this, I feel so much better to know that I'm not the only one.
Its a bit to late foer that doncha think
I didn't know I was lying back then, I thought it was really what I wanted but in reality I only wanted to get rid of my breasts, that part of my body that attracted the unwanted attention of men and made life so uncomfortable to me. That is the only decision I don't regret making.
I'm very sorry you were let down. It's weird that you got surgery before HRT but what do I know? Whatever, if you didn't really have gender dysphoria before, you sure do now. I'm MTF so....welcome to my world, I guess.

The good news is you can still be happy, you can still find support and love for who you are."	h7dyjk	trans	30	0.87	2020-06-12 04:28:32
frustrating conversation with my unsupportive father	"for a bit of context, i'm a 15 y/o trans guy. parents divorced when i was a baby, i've lived with my mom my entire life and didn't really meet my dad until i was about eight—i stopped talking with him for about three or four years due to his failure to accept and respect my identity and only just started talking to him again. pretty much everyone else in my life is supportive or at least tolerant of my identity and uses my proper name and pronouns.

my legal name is still registered as my deadname, which causes a lot of dysphoria having to see it on my meds or papers or whatever else. my mom is completely willing to change it to my real name, but of course my father's permission is also needed and he refuses to grant it.

so i went to message him the other day to discuss my trans identity with him a bit more, and hopefully try to get him to see things from my perspective and let me change my name.

the conversation started out okay-ish, but then i asked him why he had declined allowing me to change my name before. he said ""because god named you"".

now i'm far from a religious person, so cue the heavy sighing—but i knew that if i wanted this conversation to go smoothly i'd have to play to his tune, so i replied saying that god also helped me realize that it wasn't the right name for me.

he then proceeded to ask ""so god makes mistakes?"" and ""why do you think you are a boy?""

trying hard to ignore the sting of ""why do you THINK you are a boy"", i said that i thought that ""god"" made me transgender intentionally; as even though it's arduous it's allowed me to see and experience things from a different perspective and i'm stronger for it.
he then told me that he didn't think me ""believing that i am a boy"" is a sin, so, feeling a bit defensive and bristled at this point, i asked if he thought if it was delusional instead.

he said ""maybe. i don't want to hurt you,"" though it was a little late for that, but whatever. he continued with ""i think that you and a lot of other girls have been made to believe a lie.""

god, i was gritting my teeth so hard at this point i didn't know whether to be angry or just cry. i told him that i would prefer if he didn't refer to me as a girl because it made me extremely uncomfortable (which he didn't respond to) then asked what ""lie"" he was talking about—i had no idea.

""well, that you believe you are a boy. that's the lie.""

i literally started the conversation asking that he didn't go and invalidate MY experience, MY identity, especially not when he had been absent for nearly my entire life. but then he went and told me that i was caught up in a lie. i was getting sick of humoring him. ""how would you know that is a lie,"" i asked.

so he said ""it brings you immense pain, no? facts.""

my response was: ""not the being transgender itself, realizing that i'm a male and presenting as such has made me so much happier and comfortable in my own skin. it's the people refusing to acknowledge my identity, the body i'm stuck in being incongruent with who i know i am, people thinking that they know me and what being trans is like better than i do trying to tell me i'm mistaken or delusional. i am a boy."" probably could have been phrased more eloquently, but i was feeling pretty disheartened.

anyway, his response to all of that was ""why do you believe that?""

what? i don't know. explaining your inner sense of self and why it is what it is is probably one of the most difficult things you can explain, especially to someone who has no idea what being trans is like. i simply know i am a boy, and that is all the explanation you need. i shouldn't have to validate my identity for you to pick apart and scrutinize, i shouldn't have to explain myself for you to be satisfied.

oh well. i was getting desperate, so i continued to play along despite feeling angry at how unfair it felt to have to present my case to him like i was in a damn courtroom.

the conversation (me trying to stay polite despite feeling deeply hurt inside) went as follows:

me: it's kind of difficult to put into words and explain to people who don't know what it's like, because a lot of it is very visceral and not easily comparable to other experiences. but i would recommend researching something called gender dysphoria if you'd want a bit of a better understanding at least from a medical perspective

dad: OK. But try anyway.

me: okay i guess i'll try to word it as best i can

me: i know that me being a male is not a lie, i'm not a gullible person and i wouldn't say i am one without being absolutely sure. for me, when i'm not perceived as male by others or don't feel like my body is ""male enough"" it makes my skin feel all tight and sticky and like i can't move or else i'll just want to tear all my skin off—which is a little graphic, sorry—or when i'm referred to by my old name and ""she/her"" i feel all hot with shame and like i just want to hide away from everyone and cry. people who are comfortable being female and identify as such don't feel those things, but many transgender people like myself do.

me: sorry if i didn't really get the point across well it's just hard to answer questions like this because it's just an innate sort of thing

dad: But why?

dad: No, you're doing OK. You know what hurts me? That I can't call you darlin without upsetting you.

dad: Why do you care so much what someone else thinks?

me: what do you mean?

me: because i know that when you say that it means you don't see me as your son and it hurts a lot. it's not really about what other people think.

dad: Well, you just intimated that it is.

me: yes but that doesn't really have to do with being trans itself, that has to do with the stigma and discrimination that surrounds it. being transgender comes from inside factors but outside factors can worsen the dysphoria that comes with it

dad: So, why do you think you're a boy?

me: i tried to explain to you but you don't seem to understand

dad: All you said was to research gender dysmorphia. I'm asking about you specifically, not a disorder.

me: it's gender dysphoria. and i did explain my personal experience above, in that longer message

dad: Oh, sorry. But you aren't telling me why you think it, other than it's something visceral.

me: because i'm not entirely sure myself on why i feel this way. not to say being trans is a disorder because it's not, but to make it easy let's just say it is and that gender dysphoria is the main symptom—it's caused by some difference in the brain, not entirely explainable but something some people are just born with, it's not ""curable"" but can be treated with therapy, medication, and support and understanding from those close to them

me: sorry if that's not really the answer you're looking for, but it's almost like depression. in that i can't explain why i think and feel the things that i do

dad: OK, I can understand that you don't know how to explain it. But, why would you say it's not a disorder?

me: because being trans isn't a disorder in and of itself, if someone born male chose to be female because they felt happier that way it wouldn't be an issue (ignoring the factor of societal discrimination and stigma). gender dysphoria is the ""disorder"" that often comes with being transgender that makes being trans so difficult. trans ≠ disorder, gender dysphoria = disorder

(the end was a misspeak on my part, i know gender dysphoria isn't necessarily a disorder, but i was just trying to simplify things to get my point across to him easier. my apologies)

after that, the conversation sort of just fizzled out for some reason and i didn't really have the mental energy to keep it going after that. it honestly baffled me how little he seemed to know about transgenderism considering he's known about me being trans for several years at this point—though he's never really bothered to put in the effort to know me in any other way before, so i don't know what i had expected.

sigh... anyway, sorry for the long block of text, i sort of just needed to vent because i don't have any trans people in my life that would truly understand. :( is there really any hope of him accepting me at this point?"	"I don't know your stance on religion, but to me I can never take religion seriously. Not belief but religion specifically. It's all cults and will always be cults. Your father saying that ""god named you"" is too amusing. I'm sorry you have to deal with that shit. I couldn't ever take anyone seriously who gives me those types of answers. Talking with my baptist family members is like engaging with hallucinating, flat earthers. And being a trans teen sucks. Being an adult isn't easier but you don't have to rely on your parents to get approval and if your family didn't like what you were doing, it didn't matter cause you're an adult. I am glad you have a supportive family around you. Moving forward with my transitioning has been been a tough but thrilling experience.
Thanks for sharing. Idk if he can change, it depends on different factors. Time can help a lot, and as long as this conversation wasn't very negative for him I think convos like this help. Clearly he thinks he knows better than you, and he probably won't do research on his own, so unfortunately you bear a lot of responsibility in educating him.

The one major caveat with this is if he regularly consumes any mainstream media, especially right wing media. MSM and right wing stuff is hopelessly transphobic... although this pro-trans segment by Fox could actually get thru to him: 
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx4dOxYdghQ

Feel free to pre watch it. It could be relatable to your situation cause it's a trans boy teenager and the parents believe in god 🙂
God doesn't make mistakes, Satan does. So many so called Christians are not really true believers. They don't walk the path of Christ or even actually study the entire bible. Being a Christian should be first and foremost based on the love of God and it's people! And nothing else matters. Ask him if you are not also a child of God created from his image? And one of the 10th commandments clearly states: Do no harm! There are about 50 verses in the entire bible mentioning do not throw the first stone. If Jesus ever comes back from the dead, he will kick each one of those so called believers in their butts so hard that they would all end up on the moon.   

I am not religious at all, I just like to read.
It really sucks. But in three years you'll be an adult and can change your name. But not only that, you'll remember who's supported you, who hasn't, and then you'll get to choose who positively contributes to your life and gets to remain in it and who drags you down and can be safely ejected from it.

Again, it sucks and I'm so sorry he's not supportive of you. But once you're an adult, you don't need his permission for anything ever again.
i'm not too fond of religion either. too often is it used as an excuse to discriminate against those who are considered ""other"", which is the primary reason why i refuse to affiliate myself with any religion. and yeah, the urge to roll my eyes when he said that was unbearable. i was hoping to have a conversation about him and his lack of acceptance alone without him relying on some cop-out bullshit about ""god"". your acceptance of your child and their identity should be 100% unconditional, not dictated by stipulations set by some being in the sky that's not even proven to be real.

but yeah, religious nuts can be the worst. not to bring up the person this quote originates from, but ""it is always more difficult to fight against faith than against knowledge"" feels fitting here. i'm truly lucky to have a good support system though, i wouldn't have made it this far without them. best of luck to you on your transition journey by the way :)
and thank you for replying, it helps a lot to receive feedback and advice from other trans people :) i was thinking that keeping my distance from him for those couple of years would hopefully lead to a change of heart, but unfortunately i was mistaken.

i'm not 100% sure on what type of media he consumes since i don't know him that well, but considering how dead set he was on getting ted cruz elected as president during the 2016 presidential nomination i'm going to guess he's definitely on the right side of things.

thank you for the news segment! i watched it and thought the story was really quite sweet, though skimming through the comments and seeing people making the typical ""child abuse"" and ""fox is pandering to the liberals"" remarks makes me fear that my father will react in a similar way or just dismiss it altogether—though i guess there's nothing i can do at that point.

anyway, thank you tons for the advice, i mean it. even if i'm unable to sway him, you and the other commenters here have helped me recover enough confidence to at least try again :)"	vu7gv0	trans	28	0.98	2022-07-08 10:20:23
Getting closer each day to coming out and revealing my true self to the people who have shamed me, bullied me, discouraged me, hurt me. Like a Phoenix, I rise from the ashes!		"...then you whop their ass!!!( with how good looking you are!)
All the Best
Hi. I took that as my name when I came out so from one Phoenix to another, I see you. You can do this. You're valid and you matter. Come out as soon as you feel safe and ready. You're going to be surprised by how many people will love you for who you are, and the rest of them aren't worth your time. I spent a lot of time burning with anger, smouldering. Like years. I had to come out to myself, acknowledged that true secret part of myself that I'd stifled, and then I came out to everyone else fairly recently and all that pain went POOF into ash and now here I am, proud and trans and beautiful and YOU CAN TOO. I love myself now like I never did before. You're worth it, and the best revenge against anyone who hurts you is living your best life on your own terms. I wish you could feel the love, joy, lightness and freedom that I have felt these last few weeks. Seeing who I am, and who I want to become, has made all the difference for me and I wish you the best on your journey of discovery too. Stay safe! <3"	uxqhzy	trans	32	0.94	2022-05-25 20:37:08
A year ago today, I decided to transition...	"A year ago today, I decided to transition.

Last year, the evening before Chicago Pride, was the moment that I knew that I couldn’t keep it in any longer. 

In a cheap Amazon shirt and some poorly done make up, staring at the image of a chubby, beard shadowed man in my bathroom mirror - I confronted a painful truth: that relegating myself to the stuffy, picket-fenced life that I had begun to build for myself would always be a gilded cage, that keeping my true self locked away in a chest of women’s clothing in the back of my closet would slowly eat away at me for as long as I lived.

It was the night that I decided that there was a better way. A truer way. A way that I could live with. A future that I could actually look forward to. 

I set a modest goal: by Pride 2019 I would come out to just one of my closest friends. 

Here I am. One year later. The eve of Chicago Pride. Full time. Legally and socially living as my true self. 

In the interim has been what was indisputably the hardest, scariest, most difficult year of my entire life. There were MONTHS where I told myself “just make it to the end of one. more. day.” Days where I had to fight the thoughts telling me it was too much to overcome, too difficult to triumph over. 

I’ve had to battle demons in my own mind. The demons of internalized transphobia. The demons of internalized sexism. The demons of internalized shame. 

I’ve had to fight to make my space. Throwing elbows and asserting myself in a way that I’ve never had to before. I’ve had to seriously hurt people that I love to do it. I’ve had to sacrifice relationships with family and a partner whom I loved dearly.

I’ve had to face my fears on a daily basis. The fears of discrimination, of abuse, of abandonment. I’ve had to face the reality of all three as well. 

But I overcame. I triumphed. I fought and I fought and I wanted to quit but I never did. And now I’m me.

For the first time in my 26 years on planet Earth I AM ALIVE.

I’m in a life that I own. With a *name* that I own. Bit by bit I’m beginning to finally identify my BODY as my own. 

If me one year ago could see a glimpse of the life that I have built for myself today I would be in complete and utter disbelief. It was *unfathomable* to me a year ago. 

I felt inspired to put these words down tonight, for myself, but also for those of you in the shoes that I was in on this night last year in the hopes that my story may resonate within you. 

THIS COMMUNITY, both on Reddit and out in my real world community SAVED MY LIFE. 

I love you all - happy pride!

❤️🧡💛💚💙💜"	"I really needed to see this. Thanks, and congratulations.
Ahhhh I’m so happy to hear that you have no idea! I wrote it for you! 😊 

DM me if you need someone to listen. 
🤗
I'm at the make it to the end of one more day stage. Nice to see someone express a similar sentiment who came out the other end. Hopefully I'll be joining you soon.
⚠️⭐️ EDIT — CONTENT WARNING SUICIDAL IDEATION — ⭐️ ⚠️


I really did feel that way. I would drive around going way too fast thinking about how a slight tick of the wheel to either side would end my life and make it look like a tragic accident. I fit a belt around my neck just to see how it felt to walk to the brink. I fought thoughts like that from about August to January. I still have days but nothing nearly as close as that.

Looking back, in the moment the pain and the fear and the shame was all SO powerful, but I can’t imagine not getting to have the experiences that I’ve had.

Walking out of the courthouse with my legal name. 

Starting hormones. 

Seeing a girl in the mirror.

My first kiss as me!

My mom breaking down crying telling me how proud she was to have such a “brave daughter.”

Finding a workplace that not only tolerates but EMBRACES me!

And tomorrow I’m adding a new one — I’m wearing a dress out in public for the very first time! 

I would never have experienced ANY of those if I would have walked away. 

I would endure 10,000 days of that feeling to have had those wonderful moments I listed above. 😊 

I hope brighter days are ahead of you soon."	c7945y	trans	28	0.97	2019-06-30 04:36:09
Repressed feminity after coming out as a Transman	"I wasn't super feminine before coming out, but I enjoyed skirts. Rings, jewelry and makeup. I wore all these things even when aware of the fact I was a Transman because I liked them.

Since coming out to my family, Ive realised I've started repressing a lot. I avoid all my skirts, rings, I don't mess around with makeup anymore or sew costumes. 

A big mixture of it being because I don't want them to now think I'm 'faking' or becoming 'less' trans. And also because, now I'm starting to pass in public as a man pre-T under strict gender expression.

A part of me has been anxious too, that if I wear that stuff again and do like it I'll start doubting my identity. Or simply get dysphoric, in a way I can't explain but feels different since transitioning socially.

I'm worried that by the time I start HRT, instead of feeling more comfortable expressing my feminity and still passing as a man. I'll feel more pressured to own up to masculinity. 

Which I know isn't me, I want a masculine body and voice. But I am at heart, a feminine man. That's who I want to be, without shame."	"I'm feeling the same but in the other direction. People can be judgemental about gender nonconformity especially from trans people. I hope you can find the joy in expressing yourself as the feminine man you are.
In similar place, but flipped

My partner always asks why I wear jeans and a t shirt so much even though I clearly want to wear typically girlier clothes - dysphoria aside, jeans and shirts are comfy and almost always weather appropriate here in the UK
There’s nothing to be ashamed of! You are valid!
I feel the reverse with my masculine stuff"	z56epp	trans	25	0.9	2022-11-26 12:28:36
With all the negativity and transphobia you hear about, I thought I'd share my positive experience.	"Ever since I've outed myself I have recieved nothing but love and support.

I came out on new years eve last year and was able to start HRT by august.

My friends and family as well as my employer have all accepted me for who I am and support me, even though I have never ""showed any signs"" (I actively repressed them out of shame). I have yet to recieve a negative reaction from anyone.

My female friends have showered me with their old bags, clothes (most of which fit perfectly) and makeup they didn't use anymore.

My employer even made it possible for me to switch jobs from working in the workshop to back office.

I am presenting femme full time and have never gotten any comments from strangers, except for a few weird looks.

My confidence and feeling of self worth have skyrocketed and I have literally never been better.

The only thing that didn't go well from the get-go were my hormone supplements. I had a very bad allergic reaction to the pads I was given, but haven't had any problems since I've switched to pills.

I know that I'm extremely lucky to have such a supporting and loving environment but I wanted to tell everyone that there's positivity out there!

Sure, some people are transphobic bastards but fortunately they're the minority."	"Thank you for your very nice and uplifting story!

My own experience is similar, but with fewer female friends to help me out! I am happy the way that my transition is progressing too!
Our experiences mirror timelines very closely. I'm happy for you. The world isn't always as bad on a personal level as it is sometimes portrayed.

Get it, Girl!  


(edit:) I get called the ""wierd lady"" from my spouses co-workers sometimes, but i'll take the lady and own the wierd!
I think it's important to not only share the negative stuff because all it does is drag you down.

I'm feeling for all the kids stuck with transphobic families.	"I ""get"" to spend the next two months or more back home taking care of my mom who broke her hip.  

There are others here, but they're useless.  So I came 1000 miles to help out.  I've already been misgendered more times then I can count.  

It's not accidental either.  They take every chance they can to say He, or dead name me.  There's no attempt at kindness.

Away from here I'm never misgendered.  And I get to leave in a couple short months..  it really makes ya feel for those that are stuck with this BS.

Shame people can't just be nice."	"I feel you, I'm mtf pre everything and I have to live with a family where only my mum respects my decision, fortunately I can't be deadnamed because my name is gender neutral and I'm not planning on changing it but I still get laughed at by all my cousins and I can't just not visit them because ""we' re family and family have to love each other""
Ever hear the saying that blood is thicker then water?  It was originally ""The blood of the covenant is thicker then the water of the womb.""  

Basically it means that the bonds we make ourselves are more important then the ones we were born into.

"AITA? long-term parents never ""got over"" my transition"	"context: I'm an adult who transitioned over 15 yrs ago, actually non-binary (they/them) but only out to parents as (binary) trans. my parents reacted very badly at the time. I gave them books and resource links, put them in touch with PFLAG and whatnot, but honestly very little changed. they often talk of my transition as if I died, or as this terrible thing I did to them. more recently, they kind of compartmentalize and pretend to be ok with me being trans....... but some moments make it obvious that they've not made a single solitary attempt in all this time to unlearn their own transphobia.

last night, my mom asked for me to come watch a TV show. it was the next episode in a series we'd been watching together. we have very little in common, tbh watching TV is kinda the last resort for attempts to spend time together. it's occasionally semi-enjoyable, though she gets cold and quiet and makes little disapproving noises any time there's a same-gender kiss or something. well long story short, the show introduced a 1-episode trans child character. the moment the kid first talked about being trans, my mom got upset, insisted we stop watching and turn on something else. I refused, saying if she changed her mind and finished out the episode I would stay, otherwise I would go and she could choose whatever she wants to watch in my absence.

she said something about, she doesn't want to be reminded of the cis kid she ""lost"" when I transitioned or some BS. very sad voice. like voice almost breaking, tears in her eyes, whole deal. I vaguely remember her attempting to justify (""you make this all about you"" ""I just want to relax without seeing all this gay stuff or trans stuff"" ""you can't expect me to..."" etc), but I didn't engage. just left the situation.

imo, my mom's transphobia and her sense of loss are her problem, not mine. trans kids are amazing, resilient and brave and creative, any parent should be honored to be blessed with a trans kid. stories about trans kids are worth telling, and telling them can save lives. it's a shame she wants to miss out all that, and it's a shame she chooses to be stuck in her transphobic poor-me mindset. among other things, she's denying herself a great TV show and a chance to spend time with her own family.

but I know she's not gonna change. any attempt to point out how this situation hurt me, will be futile, she's never apologized or taken responsibility for anything in her entire life. I know not to hope for that. idk if the next move is to stop watching TV with her altogether, or what... the only thing I know for sure is not to hope for my mom to really, truly, actually love me for me.

but as I'm figuring out where to go from here. just wanted to share this and get others' perspectives. am I being the asshole (as I'm sure she'd claim)? what would you do in this scenario?"	"You're definitely NOT the asshole. My mother is pretty similar with the whole ""losing my child"" spiel. It's not your problem that someone, a grown adult who has lived longer than you, refuses to educate themself on something this important or listen to their own child. It seems like more of an overall queerphobia, but the transphobia is very much in the foreground. I'm sorry, i can relate and you'll get through this, op :] it's not your fault nor your problem.
I think you are in the right, if you started transitioning so long ago it's been well past the time she realized you are right there, alive and well, and she didn't lose anyone, besides a image of you she made on her own head. However that one she was bound to lose eventually because it wasn't a real person.
NTA.
So NTA. Your parents are because they’re making it all about them and their feelings and giving no thought to you. When my parents refused to accept my transitioning I cut all contact with them. They came to me to apologise and to try and fix things between us
sorry to hear your mother does this too. none of us deserves it! it's very hard for me to understand why a parent would keep putting that much grief on herself...

but thanks for your comment. truly. I'm confident we'll both get through - but it still definitely helps to hear.
thank you!

and you're right about that image she's so attached to. she brought up how she wanted a child of a particular \[cis\] gender and never got one. at the start of my transition I tried to have sympathy, because she's my mom and I care about her. but years of hearing how sad this makes her, and being blamed for it, has kinda numbed me I guess. by now she's been mourning this ""loss"" for over half my life and uh. at this point, not sure I could be bothered to pass the tissues :/"	tjdfjg	trans	25	0.96	2022-03-21 14:45:19
It’s okay to want to feel happy	"A 13-year-old teenage youth reached out to me, usually, I don't usually associate with people so young. I couldn't leave it alone though


She said ""I'm questioning my gender identity at the moment and I thought maybe you might have some advice on like... how to know for sure? I don't know - I just don't have anyone else to talk to about it.""  


So I got f2m friend I know as well and we talked in a group online, we went through how she felt, what she thinks would make her comfortable.
 
""Have you tried experimenting?""

""Like experimenting how?"" 

""With your pronouns maybe you'd feel better if we addressed you as a guy.""

""Well I've been mistaken for a guy a few times before... and I kind of liked it honestly.""

""Well alright""


My friend and I started addressing him as such. We explained that you didn't need to jump to doing this sort of thing in person. Doing this online is a safe way to test how you feel about these things with no real repercussions. They said they liked it a lot and thanked us for it. 

Today I checked in with them


""how's the pronouns been?""

""they've been great, actually. I've liked it a lot honestly, even though I'm still getting used to it.""

""You get people online to call you he/him?""

""Yeah, in a couple other servers. I didn't say anything in the ones with my close friends though, I was too nervous""

""That's alright. I didn't tell my friends for a long time. Don't rush it. Have you thought about a name? If you think it might help then give it a shot dude."" 

""I've actually been thinking about that but it's really hard to choose one.""

We went through the names they had in mind and I simply just asked them if they would like to know the meaning for their names. They said they would.
The names were between Luka and Sage, Luka means bringer of light, sage means wise. I explained to them that the name sage is more than just wisdom though, it's also good judgement and prudence.

""Have you decided which one you like more?""

""I think I like Luka a little more, but I'm not sure which one I should choose.""

""Well, I'm inclined to call you Luka when you say that.""

""Yeah, do it. I think I like the name a lot.""

So I've met a 13-year-old boy named Luka, who is having trouble with their gender identity.  
I really wish that they felt comfortable telling someone close to them, and not a random person like me online. However, I'm glad I could make someone very happy, he was nearly brought to tears thanking me.  

All I've done is ask them what they would like, sure there are a few suggestions here and there but they've made all the decisions for themselves in the end. I personally don't want to convince someone that they could be transgender. 
I am very happy though for what I've done for some random youth out in the world, I love helping people. Especially when I can relate to the issue. 

Ultimately all I've been telling them is that it's okay to want those things and it's okay to be confused about your identity. You don't need to feel guilty, you don't need to feel ashamed. 
It's okay to feel uncomfortable in your body, it's okay to seek comfort by doing these things. 
Do what makes you happy people, you've got one life! There's no shame in experimenting with what makes you happy as long as you're doing it in a safe manner. Being happy is something you should seek out. 

All I know is I've made someone so happy, and I've hardly really done anything, but I know to them I've done so much. All I've given them is the time to talk about what they think is right for them. 

It's a long read but if you got here thanks."	"Thank you for that.
Great job! I get all teary eyed thinking about what if I had a resource like you when I was young. Thanks for being a good stranger on the internet!
I just couldn’t believe how happy I made someone, they are so young but they’re thanking me and almost going to tears. 
I feel amazing about it but the same is true to everyone, at the end of the day it’s about what YOU feel. Nobody can take that away from you, and it’s important.
I love helping people out and I do the best I can and people seem really appreciative. I do try to be the person I would have loved to be able to talk to when I was growing up."	izd211	trans	24	0.97	2020-09-25 04:32:56
Teacher here. Would it be presumptuous to ask an androgynous presenting student who goes by the male version of a feminine name what pronoun they prefer?	"I have a student who presents very androgynous. Last year they had long hair and its cut off, flannel shirts, black backpack. They have a feminine name, but go by the male version. On one piece of writing, they had written the female version, but crossed off portions to make it appear as the male version. (Think Stephanie with the i and e visible, but crossed out and they go by Stephen.)

I don't want to embarrass or shame them, but I want to respect them. This student has done anything but ask to go by the male version of their name. Would it be presumptuous to ask them if they have a preferred pronoun? My thought was I could put a post-it note on their desk that says something like: ""please let me know if you have a preferred pronoun."" 

I just don't want to offend someone who just prefers to dress androgynous and is very happy as a young woman. "	"I don't think that's presumptuous at all. Quite the opposite, in fact.
I don't think it would be presumptuous, but I would think about how your relationship is with that student. Is a sticky note your best option or do you think they would prefer it if you politely asked them to stay after class and say it in person. Depends on the vibe you get I guess, but I always look at asking preferred pronouns as a positive.

HOWEVER, I am a teacher too and I'm trans/queer, though I am pre-transition when it comes to work. For me, I've had students that I knew were gay or might be trans* and I would NEVER feel comfortable saying anything about it.  Unfortunately it could be the kind of position where if you say something and a parent finds out or a different teacher or admin finds out, could bring in bullshit complaints.

For me, if a student says something to me (it's mostly been gay students) then I say something like, ""I'm glad you feel comfortable telling me, but it's inappropriate for us to talk about it.  If you do need to talk feel free to come to me and maybe we can both talk to one of the councillors.""

Usually they are telling me about boyfriend/girlfriend drama so that's why I tell them it's inappropriate, but I want them to feel something supportive from me. To me I think if they feel comfortable talking to me, then for my own job security I'd rather do it with the councillors knowledge.
I always ask all my students their preferred name/pronouns. This way I know, and they know this is a safe topic with me. 
They make ""safe zone"" signs that you can hang in your classroom to signify that you're an ally and that it's a place where everyone is welcome. I'd recommend an overt gesture like this, and then let them come forward on their own terms- or else ask everyone what their pronouns should be on an ""I'd like to get to know you"" survey that you hand out. Because while this student may or may not be trans... you never know who else is unless you make it very clear that it's a safe space, and give them the opportunity to tell you. Other students may need this just as much. 
I'd be wary of a note. 

What if another kid saw and read the note? No matter the actual situation, ""Stephan~~ie~~"" probably would not be treated well by classmates who knew the teacher was asking only "" Stephan~~ie~~ "" this question.

I'd say either ask the whole class in some way that direct draw attention to any particular student(s) or have a one-on-one chat with "" Stephan~~ie~~ "" in a way that the other students don't know the topic.
I would suggest this be a quiet, private conversation with the understanding that you may potentially be helping this student out of the closet.
My thought was that it would give them a good option to ignore it if they didn't appreciate the gesture and I wouldn't be putting my foot in my mouth if I'm way off base. 

But maybe I can talk to their guidance counselor first and see if they know anything. That might be a good first step. 

I don't mind students talking to me about their personal lives within reason. I had a student who shared a lot with me about having a dad in prison. I feel very comfortable with where the line for sharing starts and stops. I just don't want to misinterpret a situation and make things strange. 
This is a good idea. If a teacher does this, though, it's also important to note if they are a mandatory reporter (teachers are in many states) and make the implications of that clear. Hopefully not relevant to this situation!
I agree, it's not fair that only trans people have to explain ourselves. Besides maybe if you ask everyone and make it clear that respecting a person's identity is to be expected then people who are not in the closet or still questioning will be more comfortable.
Yeah the post It note definitely makes sense for that reason.

Checking in with the counselor might be a good idea.  It's not that I don't want students to share personal information with me, I'm talking specifically about queer things.

Building relationships with your students is so important and learning about their family life or struggles like that can make a huge difference in a student's life. As a queer teacher though, what I'm careful about is when kids want to talk about queer things. I'm in suburban TX so if someone wants to accuse me of ""promoting my gay agenda"" when their kid came to talk to me, I don't feel like people would back me up and I could lose my job over something like that. So the only thing I'm trying to warn you about is that you're talking about a queer specific thing which could be ""controversial."" "	3k5zov	trans	24	1.0	2015-09-09 00:27:33
My dad hurt me, but I'm going to miss him.	I live with my dad. He will be in Ecuador in a year and he won't be able to return to the United States, so I decided to wait until my dad left to start my HRT since he is a Latino father normally very homophobic and transphobic, for the first time in my life I live with him and with this I have come to some conclusions, such as: that I have a feeling of abandonment and lacked a father figure for almost all my life, perhaps be a reason why I am trans, (besides the abuse I suffered) I respect and appreciate my father and I try to get to know him before he leaves my life, he is very cold and strict but I am just someone who wants to be dear, yesterday I was showing him the video clip of bad bunny in which he appears dressed as a woman, so my dad said to get that out of his sight and that's the most disgusting thing there can be, it still hurt that I didn't show it but not yesterday I could sleep just thinking about it, so I feel like it's going to do me  I read a lot, I'm afraid that when I see myself more feminine I'm going to find it in my life, even though I really don't think so, since my dad is going to return to Ecuador I don't think I'll come back I don't want to be a shame for my parents and I will be judged by my tribe, I will stop being Quichua, hopefully my future is worth more than my past	This must be really rough for you, I hope whatever happens that you are happy	s8cjb9	trans	21	0.9	2022-01-20 06:40:48

Writing with dysphoria	"I just wrote this and if it speaks to anyone else that's awesome :)

Don't think.
Don't stop.
Don't rest.
Just work.

Anything but nothing.
That'll keep them at bay.
The thoughts,
They'll stay away.

But then I look.
It was an accident.
A forgotten mirror.
A puddle of water.

The feelings flood in.
Cold and empty.
Lonely as a void.
No one around for miles.

Its almost funny.
How heavy nothing can feel.
Unladened yet over encumbered.
A blanket of shame
No one else can see.

One day I will be fine.
I'll rise with the sun.
Feel right as rain,
And carry on.
No one will be wiser
To the internal struggle
Burried inside.

But that day isn't today.
At least not right now,
Not in that way.
Because today I fucked up.
I looked left.
I should have looked right.

Think about it this way, after you transition, you will feel so incredibly happy and comfortable. And all those dysphoric times will be gone forever :)

My Story Coming out as a Transgender, Lesbian Woman	"My coming out story is not the typical one. I grew up with Asperger's Syndrome and thus had a very atypical childhood, which made it in some ways even harder to come to terms with being transgender.

I remember when I was 13, at Disney World with my family for the annual Disney Princess Half Marathon. My mom joked about me wearing a skirt, saying I could if I wanted to, then laughing. I laughed too, embarrassed that secretly, I desired to freely wear one of those skirts more than anything.

For the next year, I would go into my mom's room and closet when I was alone in the house. I would wear take off my underwear and shorts to put on her panties and skirts, and sometimes occasionally wear one of her bras. I would walk in front of the mirror and put my hands on my hip and twirl, trying to act and feel as feminine as possible.

I just wanted to be a girl. I wanted to feel pretty, and I felt I had much more in common with the other girls than the guys. I felt like one of them. But at the same time, I thought I couldn't be transgender, because I was sexually attracted to women. Since my dad occasionally made jokes if my brother or I ever acted girly, I thought that if I talked to my parents, they wouldn't take it seriously and would make fun of me. Because my dad occasionally made those jokes, I felt like because of the body I was born in, it was shameful

Fast forward to my freshman year of at a college in New England: during the first week, I met a girl (for the purposes of this story, let's call her Lillian). She was an extremely liberal, kind woman, who had expressed in multiple statements that although she was not LGBTQ herself, she was extremely supportive of LGBTQ individuals. I began to open up to her about always feeling feminine, and she suggested the idea of being either transgender or gender-fluid. I found out that not only was it possible for transgender women to be attracted to women, but also that transgender women were even more likely than cisgender women to be attracted to other women. I realized I was truly a transgender woman; I just also happened to be a lesbian, and wasn't ready to admit all this to myself before this. She said if I ever wanted to borrow her clothes, her closet was always open. She also helped me search for high heels, skirts, and dresses online, saying that she thought I would look beautiful in red.

A few weeks later, Lillian left school for mental health reasons, and transferred to a school much closer to home. I started hanging out a lot more with my Quiz Bowl friends. However, I always would keep in touch with Lillian, and would send her pictures of me rocking my new skirts alone in my dorm room (I was lucky enough to have accommodations for a single, due to Asperger's). I began to open up to another liberal, LGBTQ friendly woman (let's call her Ally) in the group. One day, I come out to her, and she thanked me for telling me, asked me if I wanted to change my pronouns, and said that when I was ready, she would be happy to take me shopping for clothes and makeup as well as showing me how to use them. A few days later, I told her even though I identified as a girl, I still was attracted to women, and she said that didn't strike her as weird at all, and my identity as a transgender woman was just as valid no matter who I was attracted to. In November, I come out to my parents, who are semi-supportive, but insisted upon me seeing a therapist and waiting a long time before any social transition and even longer before beginning hormones.

When I get back to school, my therapist suggests it may be helpful for me to dress and live as a woman while inviting a supportive friend over to watch a movie or some Netflix for a few hours, as well as talking. I told Ally what my therapist suggested, and she said it sounds good. We were already planning for her to come over to teach me some makeup basics, so we decided to merge the two together.

When she came over, my heart was pounding. I had sent some pictures of myself in a skirt to Lillian before, but this was my first time dressed as an all-out woman: pantyhose, a white skirt with black polka dots, pink stiletto heels, a purple spaghetti strap, a gaff, and a wig. I was also originally wearing a padded bra, but I freaked out at the last minute and removed that. I did not even know how to wear makeup, and I was wearing a cheap CVS costume wig, so I was not passing AT ALL. When I saw her through my door hole, my stomach was in knots, and I was worried she would be disgusted. She knocked, I opened the door, and she came in. I looked down, embarrassed, but she looked at me, smiled and said ""Nice!"" I thanked her and said I was actually very nervous and was worried I looked ugly, and she said ""Aw, don't worry, you're pretty!"" She showed me the basics of makeup, and after I put the concealer on the parts of my face she said too, not knowing to rub it in, she chuckled and said, ""you need to rub it in; right now, it looks like war paint!"" Then I rubbed it in and she said ""That's better!"" We watched some of The Office and some of It's Always Sunny, and we talked. I asked if she would feel embarrassed to walk outside or into town with me looking like this and she said ""No! Of course I wouldn't be embarrassed!"" I told her how nervous I was before she came and she said ""Aw, did I make you feel better?"", to which, I responded yes, and said before I felt ashamed but she made me feel like it was something that was to be proud of rather than ashamed of and she responded ""Of course! It's nothing to be ashamed of!"" She asked me if when I started socially transitioning, whether I was going to take hormones, and I said I wanted to, but my parents probably wouldn't approve. And she said ""If you want to, you should! Your parents will come around!"" It was one of the best nights of my life.

My dad and I later argued about hormones and transitioning, before we all got sent home. I have talked with Lillian and Ally throughout all of this. Three weeks ago, I came out to everyone in Quiz Bowl, and two weeks ago, I came out publicly on Instagram to everyone on Instagram, to which I received nothing but supportive messages! My parents now support social transition, because they now understand it is something I need to do. They still don't support hormones, but said they would pay for it, so I am going to start when I head back to college (I attend a VERY RICH, very prestigious college in the Northeast where cases of COVID-19 are fine; they have invested nine figures into reopening safely). Also, we have agreed that I will come out to my extended family when I go back to school, because it is best that they find out while I am away from home.

Trans folks: don't worry! Even if your family is not supportive initially, it is quite possible they will come around! Find an LGBTQ supportive friend to open up to!

I now feel so happy to be an openly trans woman, and go back to college as the fully-fledged woman I know myself to be."	"this was such a heartwarming read! friends are genuinely just.. the best. i find it hard to put in to words how greatful i am for having friends who support me, help me out and hear me out on trans stuff, even though they aren’t trans themselves! the world is full of some really good people.

I need help	"a thought I (amab 18) had in my mind throughout the years, not too many times, was that I wish I was a girl. I always just ignored it, but the last few months and especially last few weeks I started thinking of it almost without stopping. I started by telling myself I'm just overthinking it, but I don't know anymore. I thought I don't have anything dysphoria related at first but I saw this: [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/presentational-dysphoria](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/presentational-dysphoria) linked here the other day, and after reading about half of it, i have about 25 screenshots in my phone for either full paragraphs or marked sentences that i related with a lot. I remember asking myself years ago and recently as well, a question I saw here too- ""if I had a button that would just make me a girl, without any other change happening, would I press it?"" and the answer is absolutely yes everytime. I love wearing feminine and girl clothes so much more, but that could just make me a femboy. I always thought my only reason I hate how I look is that I'm fat (Im indeed very fat), but thinking about it, most of my issues are just male features such as leg hair or wide shoulders. I tried making some online friends in games call me with she/her prounouns, and it made me feel so good. whenever a teacher thinks im a girl the first time (my name is for women too), they obviously get corrected as I look and sound like a man, but I enjoy the confusion very much. these are some examples, as i said earlier there is a lot more than just that.

But now where I'm starting to doubt myself. firstly, while when strangers get confused or friends refer to me as a girl make me feel great, It's very hard to me to not feel weird when I do it to myself, maybe bc I always referred to myself as a man (and in my language you use pronouns and gender way more than in english). when I asked my mom to use she/her on me for one time, I didn't know if I was more blushing and nervous or embarrassed and nervous, I just know I felt a weird warm wave on my left cheek and that I instantly looked away out of shame.

Secondly, while I feel better being referred to as a woman, It's not that I feel too bad being referred to as a man. I will say tho that when my friend got confused in the game one time it was disappointing to hear a male pronoun (not that i fault my friend just talking about the result)

I can't control myself to not think I might be lying to myself, or overthinking about myself, and what will happen if I'm wrong. but all I can think about for days, is ONLY being a girl. I know only I can understand what I actually feel, but I would still appreciate any advice cause I feel lost, and a little by myself with these thoughts."	"Hey OP. I've had a similar experience doubting myself. I'm 26, I also read the dysphoria bible in full and screenshotted like 25 different sections, underlined things that resonated, etc. There's a lot of tricky doubts you could be dealing with and you seem to understand only you can figure it out.

For context I'm still in the closet but coming very close to accepting myself as trans. For me, it was a matter of doing this reading, and sitting with the various ideas. I try to analyze these signs from my past and especially the present. If I am cis, why are these thoughts and feelings so persistent? If I am cis, why do I suffer from intense pain thinking about my body shape as a man (broad shoulders, narrow waist, defined jaw)? Why do I envy women's bodies, and wish desperately I could look like them? If I am cis, why am I crying multiple times a week when I try to think about my gender and the body shape, and life, I will ""never have?"" There are dozens of other signs too from my past. After thinking this through I realized cis people don't make such a big deal out of these things - so it became easier to accept I wasn't cis.

So if I'm not cis, what am I? It doesn't mean I have to be binary trans. I could be non-binary but femme presenting. I could be some androgynous non-binary. Idk yet. I'm still processing my emotions around it and slowly making progress. We all have our hang-ups around gender depending on our environment and how we are raised.

Sometimes time is what you need. For me, the longer I sit with the feelings and the pain, the clearer it becomes. I've also done some experimenting with shaving, wearing dresses, jewelry, and yes, online spaces where I can be a woman. These are opportunities to investigate my feelings in the moment.
Hi OP, I’m 19 and recently started transition a few months ago. 

My two cents are that dysphoria can vary in intensity, and you may feel comfortable using male pronouns only because you’ve already been so conditioned to be referred to as such for years. 

If you want to be a girl, you can be.
Btw feel free to ask me if you have any questions.
Tysm! And wish you best of luck with accepting yourself :)

My only problem as I said, is that I don’t understand how can I want so much to be a girl but not feel that bad when people (obviously) refer to me as a male atm. But at the same time I make no sense now, cause it did disappoint me yesterday and I preferred it when I was referred to as a woman. Tbh, I feel like at this point I’m just making excuses to not be trans, but idk anymore. Thank you again! I’ll try what you said
Thank you for your reply! I assumed so too, but I think I just search unconsciously for excuses to dismiss myself from being trans. I might also be affected by my pretty transphobic (and lgbtq+phobic in general) country

I have a lot of questions about transition actually, and how much control can people have on the transition, but I don’t wanna bother you too much since it probably can be googled

Was it hard for you to get used to a new pronoun? Or was it just very natural
It's entirely possible you could be genderfluid, sometimes preferring feminine expression and sometimes masculine expression. That's why I think trying different things to see if you like it can be helpful. 

In my experience, I tried wearing jewelry, really liked it, and now dislike not wearing it. I wore a form-fitting dress for a day, and now I can't stand form fitting masculine clothing. I shaved my legs and body hair, liked it a lot, and now I can't stand having it grow out. 

It's strange that I was ""OK"" with these things as they were for years and years. I just accepted my body hair, my short haircut, my masculine clothes cause ""I am a man, that's just the way it is."" Meanwhile I always hated the typical male physique and never wanted a bulky upper body. I loved exercise but only squats and yoga, cause somehow those were always more rewarding. In hindsight it was/is gender euphoria, cause those exercises tend to give more defined legs and not arms or upper body.

 I didn't even know trans ppl existed until the last 6ish years roughly. Still I thought ""those are special people, there's no way I could ever do that."" But I really envied trans women... Recently I talked to a high school friend who has since come out as trans and it made me aware that ""Oh, someone this close to me is trans, I guess it's possible for someone like me to be trans... WAIT. Am I?!""
I’m still experimenting with pronouns. I knew that she/her didn’t really feel right for me, so I prefer using they/them. 

For control on your transition, you can come out socially or start medically long before you decide to actually come out.

If you mean medical transition, you unfortunately cannot choose between side effects of HRT, which can vary a lot from person to person.
However, if you plan on pursuing surgery, you have plenty of control over which surgeons you choose and the types of results you want.
I considered I might be gender-fluid, but it sounds wrong to me (like, not in general, just to my own gender identity). Your 3rd paragraph kinda reminds me of myself. I accepted that I “have” to have short hair, but I always envy long hair, ridiculously as well, and whenever my barber cuts it too short to my liking (it’s always too short to my liking..) I actually cry for hours in my room, loudly. I also cry going out in masc clothes sometimes with my friends.
Oh, thanks for clearing it out! Hope you find your right pronoun soon :)
Nw. I think I’m ok with they/she. 

Just remember to do everything at your own pace. Experiment with things and do whatever feels right for you."	vtn1iv	trans	22	1.0	2022-07-07 16:45:52
Today is the big day!	"I'm discussing with my mom and stepdad today about me being trans. My little brother outed me earlier this week (not maliciously, he made an honest ignorant mistake) and today is the day I have a video call with my folks to walk them through everything. I'm scared, I haven't slept all week and I won't sleep tonight. My mom has been texting me all week to let me know she loves me but I've heard nothing from my stepdad who was my guy. I could always depend on him to be in my corner. I didn't want to do this this way. I wanted to tell them in person but they are very religious and I didn't feel safe telling them the last time I was home, which I feel shameful about. 

&#x200B;

I just want us to be okay and still be a family, but it is what it is now. If they disown me then I can't do anything about it. If they want to understand and still accept me or even if we agree to disagree but we can still be a family I will be happy. I didn't ask to be trans. I've begged God for years not to be but I am. I'm tired of repressing myself and being miserable so other peoples sense of normal isn't interrupted or questioned. 

&#x200B;

I've been a good son for 31 years... now let me be a great daughter."	"Honestly from the bottom of my heart good luck and I hope it all works out for you 🥰

Screaming into the void about Dave Chappelle	"I watched his special last night. He had some funny jokes but then turned on the LGBTQ community. The length of time he took making jokes about trans people and the trans community was insane. It's not even that he made the jokes, well, it is but the fact that he made them in a room full of people that know nothing about trans people or what we go through. He was getting applause for the ignorance he was spewing. 

I don't offend easily, I can see the humour in a lot of things but that was uncalled for. Speak on your struggles, what you know about. Getting in front of a crowd who isn't trans as a non trans person and making a lot (not one or two but a lot) of jokes about trans people just makes you look like an asshole. Imagine if some ""redneck"" comedian like Larry the Cable Guy got up in front of a crowd and started ranting on and on and on about the struggles of black people and the black community and making jokes about the opression black people experience and BLM and downplaying everything that community goes through and getting applause from a room full of ignorant people who know absolutely nothing about the struggles POC face... it'd be ludicrous and yet for Chappelle, it's ok? Because he had a trans friend once? Hell, he was even making jokes about his trans friend killing herself. How is this ok? Comparing trans women being viewed by cis women the same way black people view whites doing blackface.. What?! Saying over and over that he's transphobic, that he agrees with JK Rowling and agrees with TERFS... seriously?! Comparing what we go through to what Caitlyn Jenner went through like we're a bunch of overpriveleged rich AF white people?.. Come on man.. Talking about trans women using urinals ""shoulder to shoulder"" with him in a bathroom ""hiking up her skirt"" like we don't feel constant fear and anxiety of being harassed or assaulted in a men's bathroom, like we'd ever use urinals.. This guy has no clue.

The least a comedian could do is preface ignorant, intolerant jokes like these with a disclaimer like ""I'm not trans, nor do I understand anything trans people actually go through and the following jokes are completely me talking out of my ass about things I know nothing about""

 Shame on you Dave Chappelle. As a black man, you know how being part of a minority that faces intolerance and unwarranted hatred and opression on a daily basis feels. Why would you promote that for another minority?"	"The clown's a terf. It's not a joke, and it's not funny. It kills people. It's embarrasing to see the ""humor"" I grew up with in the 90s thrown around, but you know what? At least there was an outcry, instead of just more of us quietly burying ourselves. This is the kind of bullshit that made me deny myself for 24 years. This time, I'm glad to see it called out for what it is: ignorance and bigotry. I hope Chappell feels good now that he's the one doing the stomping because it doesn't last long.
I thought about posting something similar but just didn't have the energy.  It has really bothered me a lot though.  And then there was a quote from him in some article asking the LGBT community to stop ""punching down"" at him -- I guess he thinks it's punching down because he's black, he thinks all trans people are white, and he doesn't understand intersectionality??  The idea that the trans community calling out a cis male multi-millionaire for bigotry is ""punching down"" is, perhaps unfortunately, probably the funniest thing he's said in years.
As a trans girl myself it’s upsetting to see we are STILL struggling with these issues…. But it doesn’t surprise me in the least that he would be the comedian to do something like this
I'm glad I didn't watch it
HE is the one punching down."	q6ls9s	trans	21	0.82	2021-10-12 13:07:15
TikTok is horrible (CW)	"I know that TikTok is made fun of all the time for being “cringe” and all, but I still use it because there are a couple of creators that I really like on there, including some really great trans creators.

That being said, the rampant and unmoderated transphobia that TikTok just kinda allows is shameful. They claim to be supportive and celebrate pride, but they don’t do shit when trans teens get actively harassed by transphobes. There are options to tune them out, but there are often way to many to deal with.

The comment sections of pre-recorded videos are bad but you can drown them out by not giving them any likes or replies. Lives are the worst by a long shot. Most trans (or just LGBT+ creators anyway) have to have multiple moderators in order to stop them, and even that’s not enough normally. It sucks because I just wanna show some love to my fellows trans folk, but my comments get drowned out by misgendering, clown emojis and other general transphobia. And I can only imagine how the creators feel…

TikTok will take your video down for saying crap but people can just get away with this? It’s an utter joke, and people wonder why want safe spaces. Literally the least they could do is address the problem and do a better job of moderating the app, especially when it’s targeted at kids.

Sorry but I really needed to get this out there, I hate seeing this go unaddressed, TikTok does a bad job protecting POC creators and other member of the LGBT+ community, but harassment against trans people isn’t as talked about."	"Yeah I kind of wish that TikTok would do a better job at dealing with transphobia on their platform. In general, TikTok has a ton of problems with moderation on their platform. And don’t get me started with how much VERY real gore they allow on TikTok and let it stay on there for too long.
I'm tired of the transphobia in the app, it makes me want to cry when people insist that something is ""not for trans people"" or when they try to find any excuse to leave the community aside. :(("	nwt74h	trans	20	0.95	2021-06-10 17:24:15
Gender identity is so hard to explore when dealing with other mental health issues.	"I'm just in such a weird spiral of euphoria from exploring my gender identity and then simultaneous guilt and self-doubt about when I experience it. I finally got the courage to go out and buy some gender affirming clothes and underwear and shaved a bunch of my body that's easy to hide with my normal summer wear and throughout the process I was sometimes shaking with the euphoric feeling. 

Then my mind just starts spiraling with these overly critical thoughts about those feelings. ""Are you sure you're not just doing this to feel something because of your depression?"" ""Are you just on some manic craze right now and now you're just waiting for the shame to roll in?"" ""How do I know I'm not just faking the euphoria as some weird coping mechanism?"" Like holy shit how the fuck am I meant to explore my own sense of self when I just keep self sabotaging like this. I know that only I can really know if I'm trans or not, but at the same time I know that bitch and she's full of shit lol. 

Just wanted to vent since I don't really want to open up to most folks I know irl until I had the chance to explore some stuff on my own."	"The thing about gender not a lot of people like to talk about is that it's all a made up social construct. It is normal for people exploring their gender to feel like nothing is real, because at the end of the day, none of it is. Cis people just have the luxury of having their genders repeatedly said to be something ""objective"", that they believe it without questioning. When an illusion is repeated ad nauseum and is pervasive in almost every aspect of culture, it becomes hard to see through it. I found that the most helpful approach to exploring one's gender, is not to chase this feeling that any of it is ""real"", but rather to focus on what makes you happy. When you have found what makes you feel the most happy, what gender you would rather be, what you feel most comfortable with, you have found your gender identity.
I understand what you're talking about. I don't get full-blown manic, but sometimes was manic enough that I got reckless and exercised bad judgment that I beat myself up for later. I remember doubting and second-guessing myself. It sounds like you might be your own worst critic, I still am. But I bet you are strong enough to hang in there until you discover that it really does get better.
omg are you me? literally I go thru this stupid cycle over and over again, but it feels like I can't stop self-sabotaging with the invasive, invalidating thoughts bombarding me sometimes, but other times I feel \*so\* good and \*so\* strongly about being a girl, but then I start doubting whether or not it's even real, thinking I may just be forcing it, I may just be faking it, wondering whether or not it's just a coping mechanism to deal with the depression, literally all of it, but then I get so confused cus I also remember times going as far back as when I was like 3 wanting to be a girl and I just spiral ;-;
Last decade was a shitshow in my life. I first had thought about the possibility of being trans during it. But I was trying to survive. All of this delayed my self-acceptance by 10 years.
oh for sure! I am 20 just started my journey while being honest with myself! I needed a long time to get my anxiety and depression to a point where I managed to say who I am without holding it back! 

While my struggles are not gone and will not leave me alone just because I've come out, I learned how to deal with them!
I feel happiest when I feel the most like a woman, yet when the depression rolls in it feels like my brain is tryna force me to call myself/think of myself as not one ;-;
This. Gender is a set of societal expectations placed upon people.
Thanks I appreciate it <3. And yeah I mean I'm not really sure if full manic would be the right word to describe it, but the idea is similar.
Yeah its really rough. Hopefully we both get through it and find where we are supposed to be.
Beats me. I'm no professional,so I just shared what approach helped me the most. Maybe seeing a professional may help. Gender identity certainly can be much harder to explore when something like depression clouds your judgement.
same, sometimes it helps just to know I'm not the only one who goes thru this, cus I so often feel so alone, and like I'm not supposed to feel like this, etc

it's esp hard when I still don't have access to hrt and all that ;-;

God of war Ragnorök portrayed something all trans parents should understand...	"First off, stop reading right now if you don't want God of War Ragnorok spoilers. Granted, they're not MASSIVE spoilers but a spoiler is still a spoiler.

Throughout the game, atreus goes on a mission to find out who Loki is. Throughout multiple chapters he goes from people calling him loki, to kratos and mimir calling him atreus, and so on and so forth and one time atreus calls himself loki and kratos blows up and says ""YOU ARE ATREUS!"". This causes him to run away for a full chapter and the next chapter is him running away and kratos doing everything to find his son.

TLDR, atreus eventually comes back and while everyone is mad at him for running away and talking to people he really shouldn't, kratos walks up to his son. His heads hung down in shame and kratos says nothing to him but 5 words.

""What do I call you?""

He didn't care if he chose loki, he didn't care what name was picked, He learned his son's happiness and his life was more important than what he(kratos) wanted. Afterwards, atreus runs up to hug his father as his father hugs him back... And though this entire time, I couldn't help but think that this was put in to show that parents, it doesn't matter what you want. It doesn't matter if you like your child's decisions, at the end of the day, that's your flesh and blood, and you should support them throughout whatever they go though. 

I nearly brought a tear to my eye when this scene came up cause this had to of been a message. I don't care if I'm overthinking. This was the sweetest thing I had ever seen before.

God or war was already a great game to show the bond of a father and a son, and now that atreus is a teenager in ragnorök, he and his father have much more to learn and discover."		yuqrxk	trans	21	0.92	2022-11-14 06:15:53
I will send this to my parents group chat. I am closeted and they think I'm a gay man. They are very homophobic. Do you think this is a good idea, Reddit? Anything I should add?	"This is an extremely important message. It will be a punch in the gut, but it has to be said. I have become such an extremely negative and unhappy person in the last while and that's due to some things I'm aware of, but for the longest time couldn't tell you because I wasn't raised to feel safe thinking those thoughts. Our views and morals are extremely different. I think differently and I believe different things that is okay. I'm 19 and we have to come to an agreement that I can't live like this anymore. I'm not an extention of you. I'm my own person with my own set of beliefs, morals and values. To cut to the chase, I absolutely love you, all of you, I really do, but we just don't understand eachother too well, we don't see the world the same. I'm expected to do things that are not me. And I'm me, I'm not anyone else so I'm not going to adhere to your expectations of what a person like me should be like. I'm 19 which means I'm old enough to be drafted to the army, old enough to marry, and most definitely old enough to know how I want my life to be like. I can't keep living like this. I'm so dead inside, I don't feel like I'm living and I think about ending it all atleast a couple times a day. I'm not relegious either. Relegion never made sense to me and it's not fair to everyone involved, even though it's called ""the relegion of peace"", it really isn't. I'm trans. Im a trans girl. (An assigned male at birth that feels and related more to what is perceived as ""female interests and representation"" by societal norms). Science and therapy recognize this and its a real thing. It's called ""gender dysphoria"". It's a very real thing that absolutely kills you. I need to transition. I can't keep looking like this. I can't keep on living like this. It comes to a point where you no longer recognize yourself. It's not your fault (partly is), but it's most society and relegion's fault. I want to move on and live a life I actually want to live. I'm 19. I have like 50 more years to live before I die. I want to actually live them for me and not for someone else. I'm my own person and I need to move out or leave this country. I hope you understand how hard this is for me to type, feel and send it to you, but it had to be said. I can't keep on seeing everyone living my dreams and not doing anything about it or trying to do half of a thing about it and getting shut down and shamed. I can't keep on pretending in every front of my life anymore. I love you and if you love me, you will do what's actually best for me not what you think or what you were tought is best for me but evidently isn't. 

Your daughter,
Natalie (Nat)"	"> They are very homophobic. Do you think this is a good idea, Reddit?  

Homophobes tend to be transphobes. Can‘t you move out and then send it? Are you sure you are safe rn, if shit hits the fan? Do you have someone to support you emotionally if it goes south?    
If they cut you off all financial support or throw you out the next/same day?  

Thoughts on the text:  

>I have become such an extremely negative and unhappy person in […].  

Cross the *negative*. It‘s a point to be used against you as it centers you as the problem. Unhappiness is the core that needs to be addressed.  

> I think differently and I believe different things that is okay.   

Typo? Do you mean „I believe that different things are okay.“ Or „ and that is okay.“ (aka believing different things)  

> I'm 19 and we have to come to an agreement that I can't live like this anymore. I'm not an extention of you. I'm my own person with my own set of beliefs, morals and values. *  

You never mentioned the basis of your struggles. That you need your views and decisions to be respected.  
Seems like a good place to insert that here.  

> I don't feel like I'm living and I think about ending it all atleast a couple times a day. 

*Do not* include the suicidal part. They can use the written message as proof and have you involuntarily stationized, depending on your place. They can do all sorts of things to make your transition or emanzipation slower.   
If it‘s safe to get a therapist, please do get a therapist, tho. Get well soon.  
Again, make sure you have emotional support whom you trust if they react badly.  

> even though it's called ""the relegion of peace"", it really isn't.  

This feels like a confrontation. An attack on something that obviously is a meaningful part of their lifes. I would drop it or replace it. Even though I agree with the sentiment. You don‘t want them to focus on the religious part probably and start a debate. (They probably will.)  

> […] very real thing that absolutely kills you.  

Uhm… maybe drop the kill part? Sounds like being trans is this dangerous sickness and instead of giving you access to transition they need to relieve you of being trans. (When the real problem is society and dysphoria.).  

If you can include links in your messages maybe include some good ones right here.  
Maybe [PFLAG‘s „Our trans loved ones“](https://pflag.org/sites/default/files/Our%20Trans%20Loved%20Ones.pdf) right at „I‘m a trans girl.“.  
And [Cornell‘s collection of articles](https://whatweknow.inequality.cornell.edu/topics/lgbt-equality/what-does-the-scholarly-research-say-about-the-well-being-of-transgender-people/) in defense of trans & transitioning at the word „science“.  

> I need to transition. I can't keep looking like this. I can't keep on living like this. It comes to a point where you no longer recognize yourself.  

Explain the word transition. They probably don‘t know it.  
Tell them it‘s a slow process that will align your inner self with your outward appearence, which is a woman. Tell them it‘s not like their child will magically transform in a day and that this changes nothing of your personality. You‘re still the same person.  
Tell them if they can find a way to accept your choices, that they will have help to understand what is happening to you and how to deal with it themselves.  Therapists and trans family self help groups will be there for them.  
If you still want them in your life, tell them. 

> It's not your fault (partly is), but it's most society and relegion's fault.  

What is? Sounds like you mean being trans is their fault. I think the question of who to blame is redundant. What matters now is what to do, not who caused it. This will only put them in a defensive state.  

> I can't keep on seeing everyone living my dreams and not doing anything about it or trying to do half of a thing about it and getting shut down and shamed.  

Explain the „dreams“. It sounds as if you act out of envy. Like „seeing that it is possible for people like me to be themselves and be accepted“.  

> I love you and if you love me, you will do what's actually best for me not what you think or what you were tought is best for me but evidently isn't.   

I feel like changing the „you will …“ part.  
They will probably spin the „what‘s best for you“ phrasing against you.  
You want their respect, acceptence and support, despite the prejudices they were told about people like you. Include that. 


I would end the messege with a few resources. Maybe some links to youtube of supportive parents, a therapist that explains calmly what being trans is, a cheerful trans youtuber, or a lgbt+ friendly church group/ leader.
I will keep adding stuff, removing stuff, correcting stuff and changing stuff for a few days before finally sending it. What do you think?

If you don't understand some words because some words are in a different language, do tell me."	qg1ccq	trans	18	0.96	2021-10-26 07:46:04
My mom interrogated me into coming out as MtF because I painted my nails	"At first the reaction was kinda bad, with the classics, ""you killed my son"" and such, despite me asking her to let me come out at my own pace to the rest of the family she immediately went to my aunt to talk about it, quickly most of the family knows and not by me. That's ok, if a bit frustrating, at least the reactions seem positive, even my mom was positive at that point.

Few days later I'm talking to my mom about the things I want to do with my body to be able to express myself, dyeing my hair, wearing earrings, buying clothes and her response was more than once ""tale it easy, go slow and be a discrete girl like all the others in the family"" or something like this and I got annoyed every time. 

Am I pushing it? I don't feel like i am, I really think my mom is too worried about her being shamed and trying to make this all about herself.

I really appreciate opinions. Thank you very much🥰

(English not my first language, sorry for the possible mistakes)"	"Shame is a massive motivator for people. And, it is a shame as it is a barrier to the love between you.

Can you talk honestly to her, explain that you will try not to embarrass her, and ask for her help to get a bit of a look together?
Your pace means your pace and not your mom's pace. Don't compare yourself with other girls in your family; be the girl you want to be. Wanna get them ears pierced and hair dyed? Go go go gurl 💕
My first reaction was your body, your life; you need to do what you need to do. And if it's shame driving her, too bad for her.
On the other hand, there may be an opportunity. Ask her for advice so that she starts treating you as her daughter. I wouldn't spend a lot of time on this path but it's worth a shot.
Well that depends on your mom, if she's asking you to move slowly in good faith, making small changes that gradually build to bigger ones seems like a small price to pay to gain an ally.

If she's asking in bad faith hoping to slow you down or make no changes until you ""grow out of it"" that cannot be allowed.

So, do you feel like if you start small your mom will come around? If you do then that seems like a good plan. Otherwise move at a pace that will keep you safe and you're comfortable with.
Wow, I came out in a similar way. I began painting my nails because it felt good and my brother called me a faggot at the dinner table on Mother’s Day 👌
I get what you mean but I'm afraid that talk would be misguided as my transition is not about her being ashamed or not, it's about me putting my real self out. If I have to sensor myself to save her the shame I'm not being true to myself any longer.

Thank you , i appreciate the advice a lot 🥰 I sure will look for ways to close to emotional distance between us
I'm gonna try this but I haven't felt much opening yet
It isn't about her, it is about you, and your happiness. But, for you to be happy, you need her support. It isn't fair, it is about sucess."	np5phw	trans	19	0.96	2021-05-31 15:15:20
I came out to my parents	"It hurts to write about, think about, just trying to think about it hurts like getting up right now from my cozy depression den and running 20 laps. I’m shocked, sometimes hurt, sometimes apathetic and free, sometimes feel like disappearing and then sometimes grounded. I feel so fractured about it. 

I write this post in hopes it give me a little therapy sharing my story and ironing out the details of my existence. 

My parents had been questioning me, in recent FB pictures I looked too good, too feminine. It was drawing eyes and and questions, my parents began to approach me jokingly saying that I have to be a man. That I have to be strong and manly, nagging me persistently that I can’t just be a girl. They say it lightheartedly but firmly, they can’t imagine that I their 21 year old could ever be that. Could ever do something as “crazy” as transitioning. Something that was only spoken of on media and television to an Asian conservative family like mine.

But one thing about me is that I’m a piss poor liar, and especially when questioned about one of the cornerstones of my existence. I caved and I could not get myself to agree to be manly, to not be a girl, saying yes would deny me. Hurt myself in a way that I can’t wait to heal, make painful memories I would regret in the present and future. Every fiber of my being would not let me hide myself, shut myself off when I’d been backing my true self into a corner all my life. I felt rejection from every infinitesimals corner of my heart, and so I told her. I told my mother that I am trans, a girl and I am happy this way, that this is all I’ve ever wanted and more. I told her all of this under the condition that she didn’t tell my father.

People are liars and thats the only thing thats truth. My mother watched me, confess spill and cry while vehemently denying that I am a girl. That she birthed a boy with large strong bones. That I am her boy, that I am influenced, and mentally ill. She says she loves me and says out of concern that I should’ve told her when I first had thoughts ages ago. She would have sent me to conversion therapy and still wants me to go. She thinks that I’m sick and can be cured, she doesn’t believe my doctors are good since they enforce my behavior and are okay with me getting on hormones soon. 

The worst part is, that she promised she wouldn’t tell my father and then she told him while on the phone with me…

She told me its okay because he was already questioning me anyway, that he wouldn’t tell anyone else

*spoilers* he did and he didnt even wait 20 minutes. 

He began yelling at me telling me he’s disappointed in me, that ive disappointed him. I’m crying screaming I don’t care what he thinks, he is stressed and goes to his brothers to vent. He goes to my grandmothers the next day and does the same thing. My entire conservative family thinks I’m selfish and horrible, because my dad is bipolar and I can’t be happy or myself because of the effect it would have on his mental health. And they also no doubt imagine i’m mentally ill from being related to him and brainwashed by privilege. 

They are so quick to blame people around me, blame the fact that they helped me move out to a condo while in school and being independent ruined me.  

The story isnt even over, not by a long shot but to wrap. My dad came back from my uncles, and I had come home because I wanted to see my mom in the flesh, I saw him and he yelled at my girlfriend saying that he would pull out of the lease, that he wanted me home at his house. Then he backpedaled saying that its my life and that he doesnt want to see me and doesnt want a girl in the house. He also thinks she brainwashed me and is mad that she didnt tell him when I first transitioned. 

Its been a heartache the past few days, I went to a concert to drown it out, but it always comes back. The sadness, the shame, being misunderstood, feeling wrong and wronged, like ai shouldn’t exist and its my job to fight for my own existence to explain to every hardhead who wants to change and confront me that I am organic and natural and it is simply who I am. I’m just a beat girl though who can barely force herself to eat meals on time, to lift the heavy blankets that cover my depression. The fight is dim in me y’all. Please give me strength. I just want to scream that I exist and am more than an accident. 

My heart oozes just to write this so I certainly won’t reread it, sorry for spelling errors."	"I know it hurts love, I'm not gonna bullshit and say I understand because I don't. My parents went to shit long before I had the chance to come out. You aren't alone in this though, you have a community of people that feel and think the same way, so if that's wrong to them then let it be wrong to them cause it's right to you and yours
You know who you are, you know what you want, and anyone who wants to drag you down is just an obstacle. Don't feel shameful for who you are, don't concern yourself with your family's petty concerns about image, and dont feel guilty about their selfish feelings. I know when you're still in a situation where you have to be around them it's hard to avoid these things, but don't lose hope that soon enough you won't have to deal with this nonsense anymore and you will be able to live your life as you see fit without their negativity. And it's great to hear that it seems you have a supportive partner to help you get through this."	x143bh	trans	20	0.95	2022-08-30 00:04:54
Fun trans stuff with my nan	"Hi guys, I just thought I'd post a few nice light-hearted things involving my nan, who has quite advanced dementia. (Pleeeeease don't tell me off for mocking dementia - I live with hers. I know. Call it affection, a coping strategy, reclamation, I don't care which.)

So, firstly, good news is that she doesn't remember me too well from the Joe days, so that when I open the door and I'm presenting female, she doesn't recognise me. My voice is changed enough that when she asks ""which one are you?"" and I reply ""Jenny, Nan! Your granddaughter"", her response is usually something like, ""I didn't realise I had another granddaughter,"" or ""Aren't you tall for a girl?"" Which yes, sisters, I am. 

But secondly, this whole ""becoming a different person to her"", might not've even been necessary. Because in her oldies singing club today, a trans lady came in and sang a song on her guitar, etc. and my mum said that driving nan home in the car, she said ""We had someone in playing the guitar today, but you know, I wasn't sure if it was a man or a woman!"" Mum took a deep breath, and said ""Yes, it was a woman, she's transgender."" ""What's that?"" ""Well, she used to be a boy, but she took hormones, surgery and now she lives as a woman."" (Simplified and possibly inaccurate version I know) ""Gosh, well I've never heard of that before"". No complains, arguments, just peaceful cogitation........ And then a few minutes later......""You know, we had someone playing the guitar today, but I wasn't sure if it was a man or a woman!""

Like, I know it sounds patronising, but god bless her. She had a gay cousin, but when she found out Stephen Fry was gay she said ""That's a shame"". These guys are complicated......."	"Stephen Fry is gay??

Euphoria moment: sometimes it just takes a random act of kindness...	"Yesterday was absolutely horrible. On top of having to deal with one of my worst clients ever, a snowstorm blew in and made everything cold and miserable. Not wanting to deal with public transport, I decided to splurge on a rideshare. 

My driver was that one-in-a-million you get that isn't doing it for the money. Older gentleman, his ride totally decked out to treat his customers right. I barely register any of it, as I'm huddled up in my coat, just wanting to curl up in my bedroom/depression cave for a few hours before having to do it all over again. 

Then out of the blue, he asks me, ""What's your favorite color?"" and with a smile in his voice says, ""Don't say blue."" I answer that I like dark red, and the next thing I know, there's a red rose in my hand.   ""A Valentine's gift for the lady,"" he says. He tells me that he believes everyone deserves a little something for Valentine's, and that ""believe it or not, even a few guys have taken one!""

I was in tears. I haven't had a Valentine's anything for over 20 years now, and after a few weeks of being constantly misgendered, I'd given up even trying to look femme. This random man, who had braved the elements to provide a service for those in need, had given me a double dose of validation. Not only that I was a woman, but that as a human being, I was valued. We chatted a bit, he even got me to laugh a few times, and I spent the rest of the ride with a huge stupid smile on my face.

I know it's hard sometimes, to show kindness and caring in a world that gives us precious little of either. I know how easy it is to want to give up, to say to the world ""Fine, you win,"" and collapse into an emotional black hole; to keep your head down in shame instead of up in pride. But if we keep our heads down, we may never see the rose being handed to us.

You deserve kindness, you deserve to be loved, and you deserve to be recognized for who you are. [Let no one tell you differently](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmjWUjEfatc),  most of all yourself."	thats amazing!	sqzbne	trans	16	0.88	2022-02-12 19:36:01
Past Four Years	"It started with a gun in my mouth, as 3 decades of heartbreak torment and abuse convinced me it was time to do this world a favor, and ejected the emptiness that haunted my bones out into void. My eyes were pitch black as they’ve been my whole life because I knew they were always meant to offer nothing but darkness, how else could a mother look into them and say ‘monsters go to hell’. And as I stared into my reflection almost giddy with a twisted mix of revulsion yet conviction my  lips spread clumsily to articulate the only gift a creature like me could ever hope to offer, ‘one less monster in this world.’ 

But out from that black that has haunted my reflection my entire life, suddenly something flickered, and before I knew it that glint turned into a tear, as a voice I had long drowned in a life time of shame and alcohol managed to whisper a single word, ‘please’. And that word repeated, as more tears formed, and I realized that voice was my own the humanity I had long forgotten, if not completely purged by promised hellfire and sin that was inflicted on me since the moment I was born. Soon it tailed out of my mouth with strings of saliva ‘please,’ each reiteration gaining more weight yet never demanding, ‘please,’ it was a plea for pity, it pitied the creature before it, something no one has ever done before. Collapsing under the weight I with drew the gun from my mouth and unchambered the round and spoke for the first time to eyes that suddenly seem brown, earthy with potential and growth. ‘please, don’t, you matter, your worthy of love, your worthy of a soul.’ And like that I started laughing hysterically as the words ‘you matter’ rocked through me, my moment of hallelujah, overcome with madness I was still crying but they’d turn to tears of joy. I mattered, my happiness mattered, so simple, so stupid, and yet it took 32 years. So much lost time but it ended that day as I wiped my face from the mix of saliva snot and tears, and I got up and left to live my life for the very first time no longer as a monster, but a human being worthy of its innate soul.

My past four years started there, and while I lost some family, some friends and a job I loved, these past four years have been the best my life could hope for, that my life was always meant for. And while I’ve spent it mostly healing myself and not moving forward with my transition (no hormones, no surgery, but I did legally change my name and gender, and live my life fully as the woman I am) but fixing the emotional damages that mar my brain, I feel like I’m finally in a good enough place to take on that challenge and own it like I’ve owned these past four years. 

I know I’m long winded literally, because I could only speak in written word for most my life, so I’m sorry for that, but I wanted to share my beginning to remind all of you to never lose hope and always know you matter! Own it, rock it, make it your own, and jam your honesty down this crappy worlds throat, because you don’t owe them anything other than your absolute fiercest and boldest honesty and truth."

2. I don’t like having hips. 
3. I can’t wait to try this again with a binder on!
4. For the first time in my conscious life, I looked in the mirror and didn’t automatically think “ugh, this part of me looks too fat”. Holy crap, women’s clothing is a body shaming SCAM, no freaking wonder I’m always mad at my body.
5. I’m excited to use my soft new fisherman’s sweater as my dysphoria hoodie."

I need to get my story out I guess. It’s going to be long so thank you for enduring if you get to the end.	"Seeing so many of you finally embrace who you are and try to live freely as yourself is truly inspiring. 

Ive hidden who I always felt I was, who I always wanted to be from almost everyone my entire life. I knew when I was 4 that I was “different”. I used to pray and wish and hope that every day I’d wake up a girl. Obviously I figured out at some point that’s not how life works, but my desire and longing to not be what I felt I was forced to be never wavered. 

I overcorrected and projected super hard to throw people off the scent of my internal struggles. Being raised in religion certainly doesn’t help with the feelings of shame and guilt. Hearing the people you love and care about say awful, hurtful or even mostly benign but ignorant things about others you identify with, works it’s way into your psyche without you even noticing. 

At some point very early in my life I figured out I couldn’t tell anyone how I really felt. That I would get in trouble and something bad would happen. So I hid. I covered it up and stuffed my real self as deep as down as I could. Which I know is so severely common for us. I know I’m not describing anything new or shocking either. If anything my experience is tame and I should feel lucky I wasn’t subjected to real violence or anger or rejection from my family because I never had the courage to let my true self out. 

I got “caught” so to speak a few times by my family. Random pieces of clothing in spots they shouldn’t be and things of that nature. My father was far more comfortable with me being a pervert, because telling him I was touching myself with the clothes made him sigh in relief and say “ok that’s normal. If you were wearing them then we’d have a problem” which just cemented my 12 year old self in the “always keep it secret” path I was on.

That secrecy led to my other self becoming a fetish and something I thought was just a weird sex thing I had. Hitting puberty changed (or I thought it did anyway) the way I looked at it. For a long time. It wasn’t until I hit 30 that I started to truly understand what I was repressing. 

My girlfriend at the time was the most supportive anyone has ever been with me. She bought me my first nice, expensive wig and asked me if she could see my other self. She did my make up and I wore a dress I really liked and I just cried when I saw myself. It was like I finally understood that this is who I really was. It broke me but in a good way. I felt so happy and giddy and just, beside myself with joy in that moment. 

I’ve told a few people since then, close friends and no family. Though my parents did out me to them against my will not long ago. That’s a whole other thing I won’t get into right now. 

I’ve been in therapy for a bit now, trying to get a firmer grasp or understanding of my true self. Things are coming to a fork in the road emotionally for me. I need to do something about it. Living a double life is something I know I can’t handle much longer. I know this will have consequences and I will most likely lose most if not all of my family. It’s such a huge decision and I’m worried I waited too long. 

I’m not entirely sure if I have a point here but, I guess I just needed this out of me. Thank you for being part of this space and reading my rambling."	"> I used to pray and wish and hope that every day I’d wake up a girl.

pretty sure the fact that these prayers never got answered are what turned me into an atheist.

Well, welcome to the party, girl. If you haven't stumbled across it yet, I'd suggest reading through https://genderdysphoria.fyi/ -- it helped me put a lot into context.
Your entire post is so familiar to many of us.  I didn’t think there were people like me.  I felt different and in a community of one.  Little did I know that there are hundreds of thousands of people that literally went through and felt the exact same things.
With you.. Seriously I've known since as far back as I can remember that something wasn't right and to hold it for so long is a painful experience and I respect your determination a lot.
I was thinking the same thing.  I went to atheism then decided I don’t know what’s out there so now I’m agnostic.  I’m definitely not what I was raised as, that literally cannot be true based on my (our collective) experience(s).
Thank you so much. I’m definitely checking that out.

3 months ago I started HRT after waiting for it for 4 years (it took that long because of laws and inefficiency of my countries health system), I already changed to a point where I feel more comfortable with my body, I also changed my documents to correct my name and gender. 

A little while before I started HRT I meet a beautiful and amazing trans girl who I now have the pleasure to call my girlfriend, she truly understands me and my struggles and she been helping me a lot with things like getting new clothes, experimenting new stuff, exploring my new “feminine” body and breaking this weird subconscious “shame” of doing certain girly stuff. 

Less than an year ago I was a bit depressed and had frequent panic attacks caused by disphoria and I just wanted to put and end to it all, if you know what I mean, but now… I’m honestly truly happy, never been happier my hole life. I’m finally breaking free of this meat prison.

PLEASE READ. Cis person wanting to help 11 yr old with Gendering Avatars. Advice	"Hello Everyone,

I wasn’t sure where would be the best place to post this and maybe this isn’t the place and I don’t mean to offend anyone but I thought why post on advice when I can actually reach out to people who have maybe experienced something like this growing up. 

So I am a cis 21+ female and I have a 12 year old sister who is my world who lives hours away that I play video games with on a daily basis to stay connected especially since her household is pretty toxic.. anyways she has a best friend who is 12 that often plays with us and hangs out with us when I go visit. 

For months now she has dressed her avatars as a boy and I haven’t thought about it or cared or commented. 

I’ve become concerned bc recently within the last month she goes on and before a game tells us “just warning you I am dressed as a boy” nervously stating she is just trolling or doing it for fun or as a prank? To me it sounds like she is embarrassed or insecure about it and feels she to give a reason. 

It kinda bugged me today so I told her that she doesn’t need to be trolling to dress up as a boy. Her avatar is cute and she can wear whatever she wants. Clothing are a form of self expression and identity and she should wear what she feels is right no matter what. My sister stayed quiet I think it really went over her head. She edited her avatar later so it was a boy body figure, hair and masc head and facial features with Id say gender neutral accessories and a skirt with heels. After she made her outfit she apologized and said she just wanted to stay as a boy but like this and was very self deprecating about her avatar. 

I didn’t know what to say at that moment or what was correct but I felt so upset at the thought that she felt like she’d be judged for this that I told her it looks adorable it looks cute and edgy and it looks very gender neutral to me ( I feel terrible about whether or not I used this term correctly) but it was such a mixture of what society deems as girl boy that I didn’t know what to refer to it as. She basically exclaimed “that’s what I was going for!” And sounded very happy. To me that’s not someone that was doing it as a joke. It’s what she felt happy with. 


I feel like I should have a conversation with her about how she should feel free without shame to express herself freely and about gender but I am not sure if to bring any attention to it and if I should let her develop organically or if it is even is my place. Her parents are close to my family and I don’t want to overstep but she has a bully for an older sister and I’d say her parents are clueless on the issues. 

As a lesbian who grew up with no representation or role models around me I know silence can sometimes be deadly. 

What should I do ? What should I say? Did you ever experience this? What do you wish people said to you? 

She’s joined LGBT groups in this game and adds rainbow accessories all the time so I really think she is processing some kind of feelings right now aka discovering herself so I really don’t think she is just playing around. I think this all means something to her.

 
I want to be there for her but I also am CIS. Yes I am gay but what the fuck do I know about gender dystrophia or anything of the sort. I don’t know what I could contribute but I don’t want to be silent"	"First off: Thank you, your sister is lucky to have someone who cares enough to ask.

Now for advice. I'm not fully sure if it's safe for her to come out where she is at, that is something you'd know more than I would since you know the household.

I think honestly at this point if lgbt is already on the radar that's a start.

I'm horrible at knowing what to say as kids but I think even just talking about people you have talked to about gender would be nice. If you're respectful about it it will show her a) That transmen and nonbinary people exist. b) That you're 100% supportive of trans rights and are a safe person to come out too.

My greatest frustrations when I realized I was trans was that nobody had even mentioned the existance of transmen or nonbinary people and that I didn't know who was safe to come out to at times. Like my family, big mistake mostly. My little sister is kind of ok about it.

Beyond that, let her lead the conversation. If she says she'd rather be referred to as they/them and as your sibling figure out where she feels safe to come out and use them in those scenarios even if you're referring to the past. Same for he/him and wants to be known as your brother. If a name gets chosen use that name, again even if dealing with the past.

<3 I hope this is at least a helpful start. I communicate easier in conversations but for now this is what I can think of.
Defensive measures could have been learned to prevent shaming from peers or authorities like parents, escaping through gaming and via friend's house, and anticipating uncomfortable questions from an adult; I'm wondering if she (so long as she/her are the pronouns she has so far used) does not feel comfortable talking about this with her parents becuase they have already expressed lack of support. At that age, parents are a huge factor in how  much can be done. She's already seeking out peers in lgbt+ groups so that's a good sign. Kids pass knowlege around fast so as long as you remain as a trustworthy and acsepting adult, she will more likely trust you with questions later.

It's also okay for both of you to be uncertain. She doesn't need to be certain to try out different pronouns or gender expression. You don't have to have definite answers to questions so long as you show your willingness to listen as you have already done. Hopefully, her parents are also willing to be as open. If you need an icebreaker to guess the parents feelings on trans masc/nonbinary people, Elliot Page's coming out letter is recent enough news to casually bring up.
@OspreyRune Thank you for reading and responding! It is meaning so much to me right now!! This is actually great advice so I’d say 10/10 you would know what to say as kids Lol 

I am so sorry about your family. That can never be easy. 

I definitely want her to know that I am ok with it and that things like this exist. Visibility meant everything to me I can imagine that the trans community feel that as well. I really can’t think of a non binary or trans character that a child or teen can connect with on television which is actually so fucked up so I will have to find some way to do it to let my ally ship known. 

Again, thank you so much for commenting I feel so lucky to have people who have experienced these offer any thoughts
Just letting you know if you are unsure of someone's gender, ""they"" is correct whether you are talking about a man or a woman. It is usually not preferred by binary folks, but it is not incorrect.
@Scrambled_Lizzy Thank you so much for reading and responding! It’s actually so validate to hear you say that she does really have some defensive measures already in place because I asked myself for a moment am I being crazy? But what else is that kind of behavior if not defensive and defensiveness is really a self preserving tool. Why else would she feel the need to protect herself? 

And yes thank you. I definitely agree about the uncertainty. I didn’t know how to put that in words. So this is very validating. I do not want to mis gender her or add any distress to the process of her figuring it out. I am so aware that I am in her life during key development and something like this is processed over time. I do not want to push a delicate flower.

I think bringing up Elliot is so genius. I will definitely do. I am already bracing for the worst bc last night I realized if my own mother is a transphobe who is not deliberate about it I guess as compared to others but has made enough comments where I have had to call her out so many times. I can imagine her best friend (this girls mom) is not that off base but we shall see. 

Definitely nervous about this as my fear of talking on things this important when I haven’t experienced them and especially when it’s the first time it’s ever been brought up to a cis Hetero person makes me want to throw up but I know it’s got to be done
I've only found one piece of media that had a trans man beyond badly done historical drama movies. That was a comic about a teenage trans guy who comes from a family of magical girls and tries to battle monsters and dysphoria.

If I can ever draw consistent enough I'm planning on writing a comic called God's Gay Harem with a trans man lead but that's awhile out.

If you need anything my messages will be open.

Also I totally don't mind being mentioned as ""Osprey, a new trans friend I made online"" ^_^ So you have at least one trans masculine example.
True, I'd edit after I've hand some sleep.
They may still be searching for the right words to describe their feelings right now so using They and Them as singular pronouns might be a new concept.
All good, I just saw you were uncomfortable using one or the other, and it isn't always obvious as an alternative :)"	kpgqrz	trans	17	1.0	2021-01-03 08:05:54
"Parents would never accept me, what are some ""normal"" things I can do right now that'll help in the future."	"I'm a 16 year old guy (currently) living in southern America.  While my parents wouldn't be as cruel as many others, they'd still certainly be disappointed.  Due to shame I won't tell anyone in real life.  For the time being, what can I do to become more ""female"" without it being obvious.  "	"[deleted]
Another comment mentioned some of this, but this is what I did: I wore jewelry  (earrings, necklaces, rings) all the time.

I would also put on eyeliner more often than not.

I kept my hair long, wore jeans from the girls section that weren't overly obvious, had girls sneakers that weren't obvious, occasionally I would get a hoodie and/or T-shirt from the girls section.

Just very minor things. I kept facial hair, but wore tighter clothes. 

[me, a year and a half before I started HRT ](http://i.imgur.com/nfRpW5v.jpg)
What about shaving.  I don't know how I could do it without people catching on to something.  As well as diet.  Losing muscle mass and having a more ""female"" figure.  Thanks for the advice though.
Aside from the facial hair you didnt look too far off at all.  I think I could probably make good process while not being obvious about it.
Yoga or other exercises with an emphasis on flexibility. 

Learn how to feed your body, and what it needs, without stuffing it. Males seem to learn this much later in life. 

Any activities that interest you like dancing that you can start to pick up now?
As in shaving legs? I'm in a similar situation and I only shave mine during the colder months so it's covered by pants.
Yeah. And [this](http://i.imgur.com/oDKdU4G.jpg) is what I look like now.
I definitely don't have the self confidence to dance around other people.  I do enjoy running though.  I used to lift weights but I've stopped.  Never considered yoga but I ld have to do it without anyone around.  Thanks for the advice!
Yeah.  I don't think anyone has really noticed but I shaved all my body hair and aside from razor burn, it just feel more clean.
I'm so jealous lol, I'll never have hair like that.  You look great!
Keep the running up. Yoga can be done in groups, but there are a LOT of YouTube and other videos available for self practice. (Which I do.) Dancing can be worked on at home too. 

Got any female vloggers you like, that you can watch and use to practice voice with? 
Nope, don't really watch many youtube videos.  The few I do is just music.  Any recommendations?
Go peek at a subreddit that interests you, or go explore. 

R/yoga has some great recommendations that include YouTube for example. 

What do you want to do? I'm sure you can find some great ones for you. 
Stef Sanjati is a wonderful trans woman that has some great videos on vocal training and make up."	6ee71n	trans	15	1.0	2017-05-31 10:57:59
I am so tired.	I am starting to lose hope in my future. I feel like nothing is going to be better. My state just has so many transphobes that once I turn 18 I am still going to be shamed. Is it even worth it? Why should I even try if nothinh changes?	"Don’t lose hope. Save as much money as you possibly can. Start transitioning subtly. I’m with plume rn and it’s $99 a month buttt there’s plenty of perks and stuff that you get. For example just last week they had a webinar and how to legally change your name. They’re able to send referral letters for surgeries, therapy, hormones, and legal stuff if needed. With insurance I literally pay $5 a month for hormones. There’s just so much to look forward to
Its easier to move states than you might think
Also I’ve learned that surgeries aren’t just about affording or not. Some doctors require you’ve been on hormone therapy for a certain time for bottom surgery. Some surgeons are partners basically with insurance companies meaning a reduced price 😁. Sooo yeah if you have a job I recommend that first hand. They have some restrictions on age but they’ll tell you whether or not a parent has to do something
I am saving money to move but I don't know a lot of people from other states except online friends. Also moving to somewhere you don't know sounds scary on its own"	qxigoj	trans	16	0.92	2021-11-19 15:21:39
F*ck shame	I was just in a clothes store with a couple friends. I saw a ton of clothes that I would love to buy and mess around with to see if it fits my style. But every time I think of going over there I just freeze and I can’t move. There’s just this blanket of shame over my entire existence. I’m fully out as a trans woman, and I have absolutely no confidence to wear or buy the clothes that I want. I’m so tired of this shit.	"Life's too short to stop yourself from wearing the clothes you like. 

When I was questioning I would go to clothing stores by myself and try on something I liked. Just ignoring all of the negative thoughts and feelings and letting myself enjoy being a girl and trying clothes I like on. 

It's really tough but it helps a ton to know you're doing things you want/need on your own and then you can do it with friends when it gets easier. 

Either way, I wish you the best of luck in your shopping endeavors. You deserve to feel pretty~

Edit - I should also preface this by saying to stay safe cuz idk your situation but good luck i hope you can be happy."	xu4kg4	trans	16	0.95	2022-10-03 00:32:56
Graduation will be a disaster. I need advice.	"I'm 16, genderfluid and a trans man, and I'm closeted. My graduation from highschool is next month. I was really excited at first but now I'm mortified for several reasons:

1. The pictures. This one is self explanatory. I can forgive the ceremony pictures not being the best but the pictures that my family will have me take mean that my mother will make me look all pretty and feminine and I'll not only be shamed for acne scars but forced to look a certain way. I can endure the pains of removing some hair off my face but my hair itself, if styled a certain way, will cause sensory issues and I'll lose my mind.
2. I have to give a valedictorian speech and my voice dysphoria and social anxiety make me want to cry already. I hate how I will sound and I abhor how I will look in front of everyone. I don't mind wearing a dress but it heavily depends on the type, but my mom is completely okay with more neutral clothes but if I wear anything form-fitting I'll have a horrible day.

Please help. I am especially worried about the speech.  I hate all of this. If I'm lucky enough to be a girl or enby on that day, then these details will be fine, so this leaves body image issues that aren't related to dysphoria but are just me hating *certain* features of my face on *certain* days. God I'm just betting on feeling pretty that day or I'm doomed.

Edit: by the way if I do manage to slither my way out of my mom's image of me and manage to feel masculine/nonbinary that day, then I'd look great in a dress, but *only* if I feel good about my face. Yeah. Nvm I just remembered that chests exist whoops.

My best friend and queer-platonic partner who was my biggest supporter when figuring myself out thinks that I should treat this as a cosplay and that I am only pretending to be a girl for the ceremony but we'll see about that."	"I like your friends/queer platonic partners suggestion as a your ace up your sleeve in case you don’t feel at your fullest confidence. And congratulations on being valedictorian, though I know it means this stress, but seriously, that’s awesome. All you can do is own it, your you, and yes you have these insecurities but they belong to you, you set them on yourself, don’t worry about how your perceived by others, because we can’t know predict let alone counter because we just don’t know. I hope it goes well for you, try not to stress it, just be your wonderful self, or cosplay the hell out of it, but regardless try to make it memorable and fun.
>My best friend and queer-platonic partner who was my biggest supporter when figuring myself out thinks that I should treat this as a cosplay and that I am only pretending to be a girl for the ceremony but we'll see about that.

I can confirm that this trick worked remarkably well for me.  I didn't - and still *don't* - mind public speaking at all.  The me in front of an audience isn't *me*, it is a useful character that I play.  (I will also say that I did this in many, *many* aspects of my life since my pre-cracking dysphoria manifested as dissociation.  I didn't recognize it for what it was at the time, and while it was certainly detrimental overall, by ability to inhabit a character helps tremendously in my professional life.)
For your speech, I would write it out, edit it way beforehand. Then practice it out loud at least 50 times, maybe in front of a mirror. 

Wear something you are feel comfortable in. 

Practice paced breathing before hand, practice slowing the out breath to help you relax. 

I would also go on YouTube a do a voice warm up exercises. It will help with confidence too. 

Good luck!
Thank you so much this uplifted me a lot!! I'll try my best to focus on enjoying this. Thanks again :)
I'll keep this in mind. I'm glad it worked for you! Thank you!
I didn't see this earlier but thank you!! Update though: when I wanted to rehearse in front of my parents, social anxiety killed me, and my mom realized that I do have social anxiety (didn't tell her before). Anyways, but after that when I rehearsed multiple times in front of the principal, I did better and better each time, and in the end it was amazing. But today they announced that someone else was chosen instead of me to give a speech, which is eh because I was the actual valedictorian but they might have something else planned.

It isn't completely a waste because I gained confidence and enjoyed practicing voice training at home in secret. The main problem was being monotone but I was working on that until, well, I ended up not being chosen smh

As for clothes, my mom and I are gonna pick something I like! She gave me the freedom to choose whatever outfit and hairstyle I want and I showed her pictures (something I never thought I'd ever have the courage to do). I was very happy and euphoric about this but so \*far\* we couldn't find anything, but we're gonna try again :)

Thank you
You’re very welcome! Glad I could help. Please let us know how it goes, we’re all rooting for you here 😉
I'll let you know!
Update! So the ceremony is on the 12th. After doing so well in my rehearsals (contrary to my expectations), they ended up choosing another student to give the speech... But that's okay because turns out my mom doesn't want to force me to look a certain feminine way and gave me the freedom of choice. I showed her what haircut I want and what suits or dresses I'd like and she supported it! (I'll still go along with her wish to do my eyebrows and remove sideburns eh instead of object too much, it is fine. As for makeup she listened to me about wanting it as light as possible or none at all because she knows how I react to it)

Even though I prefer a suit, I've stopped worrying about the dress because I found styles I'll look cute in, even as a boy. Well, that means I'll be misgendered but who cares!! I have my friends' support and I'm at least getting the haircut that will give me gender euphoria. Thanks everyone for your support in the comments.

However, I was so proud of my rehearsals because of extreme social anxiety. My classmates really loved it. My mom said that the school probably has something else planned which is why they chose the other dude. Either way, it's fine! (Still hoping we manage to find a suit for me)
Update!! It was yesterday. I wore the perfect suit and recieved an award for honourary distinction and the ceremony was fun :)
That’s great! I’m glad you had fun and it was a success!"	uqzggf	trans	13	0.82	2022-05-16 16:09:37
I miss being loudly queer (i.e. Trans and out on public)	I moved to a city that's more conservative than my hometown. I had so many queer friends and felt that I could be out and loud and happy about it, but now (mostly for safety/gossip reasons) I feel the need to hide my transness. It makes me yearn for the time in highschool/college where I felt the most proud of being queer. Now I just hold shame and secrets. Idk just a vent :(	"i understand that. sometimes i feel that way, but i have also learned to love my stealthness & the comfort i feel being perceived as cishet.

finding friends that know & love your queerness may help. being extra queer on the internet might help. or maybe you find that you don’t need to be as discreet as you think in your new city. i wish you luck!
I wish I could feel proud of being trans publically. My family, my extended family, my local friends are all transphobic. My state (Queensland in Australia) is easily the most transphobic state. It makes me feel so vulnerable and alone.

The only consolation is that I have friends in England that validate me. I was actually able to come out to them, and I feel they love me so much. A shame they live on the other side of the world, and that Covid has made travel absurdly difficult, but one day I will be able to travel and be around people that support me.
Get really buff so you can be loud about it and be able to defend yourself if need be
You know I have thought about that, but I'm also a pacifist and would much rather not deal with physical conflict. A wonderful fantasy though :)

Reddit Doesn’t Consider Misgendering Hate Speech	"Sorry if this isn’t the right place for this type of post. 

I’ve recently started following a Reddit live-streamer who is clearly a trans person that presents as a woman. Super talented musician. Says nothing about his/her/their gender. 

There is always 2-3 accounts present intentionally misgendering this person and saying repugnant things. Maybe it shouldn’t upset me as much as it does, but I was getting very upset at these individuals who were *intentionally* bullying this individual and misgendering them. I don’t even want to repeat the horrid things these people were saying.

I decided to report them to Reddit and all of my reports came back saying that it doesn’t violate their community guidelines. It’s completely shameful. Facebook and Twitter both now consider misgendering someone hate speech. Why is Reddit so backwards? Am I overreacting?"	Reddit doesn’t consider it hate speech at all. I think I know of the RPAN streamer and have reported under there, to get the “nothing to see here” type response. I’ve experienced it too. There’s definitely a ton of insecure people out there purposely misgendering people	lieicv	trans	17	0.88	2021-02-12 16:25:48
My Transiversary! A year in review	"My egg cracked about a year ago, and I've arbitrarily chosen the 12th as the anniversary date, because you know, 12 = a dozen, like eggs.  Get it? I figure I'd celebrate by reflecting on everything that transpired over the past year because it's been a wild ride.  It's been a year marked by firsts, blossoming as a human being, celebrating new and old friendships, and of course, a fair share of hardships.  I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

About a year ago, I finally gathered the courage to punch into Google a burning question that had been slowly making its way to the forefront of my mind:  Am I transgender? There was a mountain of evidence, but I refused to acknowledge it for my most of my life, instead figuring I could just ignore the issue and hope it would go away -- you know, like a totally healthy, productive way of dealing with any problem, right?

So, everyone here knows that doesn't work. At least, not forever.  That feeling of wrongness grew and grew, and while I didn't exactly know what to call it, I had a pretty good idea, despite not wanting to admit it to myself.  When I finally mustered the courage to ask the question, putting what had hitherto only been an abstract thought, my greatest fear, and darkest secret into the physical world, it wasn't so scary.  I found a community of people who had those same fears, secrets, and thoughts which make absolutely no sense to the rest of world.  And you welcomed me warmly.  I finally had a community which made sense.

The first person I came out to was my best friend from high school.  She's the only person I've consistently maintained contact with after graduation, some 17 years ago now.  I called her in the dead of the night, sort of in a bit of a panic.  I had said the words out loud to myself, but I needed to say them to someone else, and I knew that no matter what, she'd be accepting.  So, I just blurted them out, ""I think I'm transgender."" After a small pause, she replied with, ""Really?"" in an inquisitive tone.  I described to her the journey that led me to that conclusion, and she added, ""Honestly, that makes sense,"" and went on to detail some things she remembers throughout our friendship that weren't exactly cis.  My spirits were lifted.  Sharing that burden with her was one of the best feelings of my life.

The next person I had to tell wasn't going to be supportive.  I knew she wasn't going to be supportive in advance, but there was no escaping it, and there was no moving forward until she knew, because she's my wife and the mother of my two children.  It took me almost a month to gather the courage to come out to her, and it resulted immediate destruction of our romantic relationship, and the near death of our platonic relationship as well, though I'm pleased to report we're on much better footing now, though we're currently separated and heading towards divorce (an amicable one, at least).  When I told her, she cried for a week straight.  I felt horrible.  She confessed that she knew there was *something* wrong, but she didn't know what, and she never would have guessed it was this.  I felt a lot of the guilt and shame that I had feared for so long.  I didn't want to hurt her, but I was hurting too, and how else was I going to make it stop?

She convinced me to get into therapy, which was a godsend.  Having someone who was completely unbiased with whom I could discuss anything and everything was really empowering.  I had an outlet for my fears, secrets, and anxieties in a judgment-free space.  She helped bring into focus this person I was becoming and gave me the tools I needed to take care of that person emotionally and mentally. She reaffirmed that the things that I was feeling are legitimate, not just some depraved fantasy, not just a mid-life crisis, not just a fetish.  She taught me how to advocate for myself and my needs and not put up with other people's attempts to bully me into being who they want me to be.

Around the same time, I reconnected with another best friend from my childhood.  We'd been best friends from about 3rd grade through high school, but we'd lost touch during our early twenties.  Amazingly, she had also come out as transgender about a year and a half prior, and she's been extremely helpful as a sort of big sister to me (despite being six months younger), offering beauty tips, tips on transition, and tons of moral support.  Our friendship picked up exactly where it left off 15 years ago, and we're closer than ever now, despite living quite far apart.

July and August wound up being a really difficult.  At the time, we'd been living overseas in the UK for the past 3 years, and I learned at the tail end of June that my company was sending me back to America in mid-to-late August, which gave me just under two months to get my affairs in order for a huge trans-Atlantic move.  My wife wound up taking the kids and leaving early, partly to go house hunting and help out with elderly family, but mostly to put some distance between us.  We were at a low point in our relationship, and she left me in a big empty house filled with years of memories both happy and sad, children's toys, and deafening silence.  I cannot adequately describe the sorrow of going home everyday from work to an empty house that has been furnished to provide a loving, safe environment to raise two children, knowing that neither of them will ever set foot in that house again. I cried just about every day for a month and a half.  Worse still, because of the global shipping slowdown and bureaucracy, by the beginning of August, the original date for my return to America was looking more and more tenuous.  I had no clue when I would be reunited with my kids.

One benefit to having the house all to myself though was I got to really explore myself in a way that I had never been able to before, and haven't been able to since.  I bought an entire wardrobe of women's clothing, got to practice my makeup, and removed all my body hair.  I was surprised at the transformation, even without HRT.  The person in the mirror was an actual-factual woman, and even FaceApp saw me as a woman.  Maybe there was hope for me yet!

I also spent that time coming out to the friends I'd made in England, knowing that if they reacted poorly, it didn't matter because I was leaving soon.  I knew at least one of them would be very supportive because she was openly non-binary (she/they), though she mostly just presented as female, so I assumed she was just using she/they for woke points, which I'm fine with.  Instead, I got the shock of my life when I came out to her -- after she congratulated me for recognizing my authentic self, she told me she was AMAB, which had me in disbelief.  She sent me some ""before"" photos and we stayed up late that night just discussing trans things, such as weird thoughts and habits in our pre-realization lives, and again, there were remarkable parallels.  Among all of my UK friends, she became my best friend literally over night, and we've remained in contact ever since.  Most of the others immediately accepted me, and switched over to female pronouns with my even asking, and the holy moly, the first time I got gendered correctly, *I was not prepared*.  The euphoria sent a tingly warmth radiating from my chest out to the tips of my fingers and toes.

By August, I'd gathered the courage to start wearing nail polish out of the house.  As I was saying my final goodbyes to former colleagues, I met up with one person in particular, with whom I'd worked in London.  He was a gay man, but wasn't super out about it.  We had bonded over RuPaul's Drag Race when we worked together.  I showed up in bright blue nail polish, and while I wound up not coming out to him, he definitely noticed, though he was too polite to say anything.  He had previously said I didn't ""seem like the type"" to be such a fan of the show, and when I asked why, he said because I was such a clean-cut, cishet man, not really the demographic of the show.  It'd always been a bit of a guilty pleasure for me, and admittedly, I wasn't sure why I was so enamoured by it either.  I guess it makes a lot more sense now, although since my egg cracked, it's become a lot less appealing, because RuPaul is just such a problematic person, and because I've definitely seen how drag queens have an inadvertently negative effect on trans women.

I came out to my mom in August, who thought I was joking at first.  She kind of freaked out when she realized I was dead serious. I video chatted with her while fully presenting female, and after the initial shock wore off, she proceeded to tear into my makeup technique, my choice of colors, my choice of attire, etc., under the pretense of being helpful, but really it felt more like uninvited criticism for the sake of making it difficult for me.  A few days later, she had some questions for me ""out of concern,"" and interrogated me on matters about which no mother has any business inquiring. She did, however, respect my wishes and kept the information to herself, for a while anyway.  She has cried on the phone just about every time we've spoken since then, describing grief over ""the death of her son,"" how the ""little boy"" she loved is going away, being replaced by a stranger.  Lay it on thick, mom. Since then, she has also offered plenty of unsolicited opinions on HRT, statistics on detransitioning and suicide, and, of course, The Surgery\^TM, most of which are well-meaning but misguided, and ultimately unwanted.  It's clear she's still trying to talk me out of being transgender.

I wound up flying back home to the US on September 1st, and reuniting with my kids will forever be one of the happiest moments of my life.  I sobbed tears of joy at the airport, which really confused my 4 year old, who didn't understand how I could be crying if I was so happy.  We basically wound up being homeless for the several months, as the housing market was insane and there was no inventory in our price range, and even limited inventory at around double our price range.  We owned a home here in the US which we rented out while we were overseas, and we were ultimately forced to evict the tenants, which was probably one of the hardest ethical dilemmas I've ever been forced into, especially due to the fact that the tenant is a genuinely wonderful person, who's well-known in my area as a leading advocate for transgender youth.  Yeah, I still feel like shit about it.

Due to my housing situation, September through November was a long period of stagnation for my transition.  We were living intermittently with various friends and family, so privacy was at a minimum.  My wife and I still weren't doing great as a couple, but we had mended fences enough that we could stand to be in the same room together, and were doing an excellent job co-parenting, especially under the difficult circumstances.  Our 6th anniversary was in October, and it wound up being pleasant, but awkward, as it was the first time the two of us had been alone together with no kids, certainly since I blew up our marriage with ""my big reveal"" as she had once cruelly called it, but probably since 2019.  There was an elephant in the room that took us half of dinner to finally address.  We addressed it, and there were apologies from both sides about how things were handled, acknowledgments about how things could have been handled differently, and a resolution to work together as a team to raise our children, regardless of what happens between us.

I came out to my dad on Thanksgiving day.  I was really terrified because I had no clue how he was going to react, but my mom basically said, ""if you don't tell him, I will.""  My mom had pretty much reacted exactly how I anticipated -- she didn't disown me or express hatred or anything like that, but she also overreacted and has behaved in a way that's really counterproductive.  She was a known quantity, which is why I had come out to her first.  My dad was a complete unknown.  I had no clue about his thoughts on trans people, other than I know that he tends to vote Republican, though he can't stand Donald Trump or his ilk, and thinks both parties suck equally. He's also fairly conformist.  I was really into the whole goth counterculture when I was a teen and he refused to be seen in public with me at the height of it. He also tends to make light of race/sexuality/gender/religious minority issues, so I was really expecting an uphill battle.  I had sort of pre-emptively stopped talking to him for a few months, because I was not expecting it to go well.  I was pleasantly surprised. He took me seriously, and told me that he didn't know how to help, other than to give me his support and love.  And that was that. I've actually found out that in private conversations between my mom and him, he's actually shut her down several times for overstepping and not showing the support I need.

In December, things had settled down.  We were back in our old house, and we were establishing our new normal.  We took a trip down to Texas to visit my family for the holidays.  One of my close family friends was having a wedding while we were down there, and we were invited.  It was quite a ways away though, so my wife and I had another protracted period of alone time with no children.  It was excruciating.  There were some issues that had remained unresolved for her, and she took the opportunity to address them while we were driving up, during which time she said some really hateful things.  I honestly don't remember what she said, just how she made me feel, and she made me feel like shit.  It was just such an unprovoked, vitriolic rage -- who was this person I was trapped in the car with? The wedding wound up being a miserable experience because of it.  She initially intended to sit in the car for the entire thing, which was ridiculous, so I insisted she come inside.  She was standoffish the entire time, and as soon as the last of the traditions was completed during the reception, she bailed, and I left shortly thereafter.  I texted afterwards to apologized to my friend for my wife's brusk behavior during her big day, and she left me on read.  I haven't heard from her since.

I came out to my three siblings while I was down there as well.  The reactions were two shrugs and a whole-hearted embrace of who I am.  My sister (she/they) is delighted to finally have a sister.  She's accepted me from the get-go and has only ever referred to me as Cassie or Cassandra since learning.  She also frequently corrects my mom when she stubbornly refuses to get it right, something that I've not even been bold enough to do.

I have another friend down in Texas I always make a point to visit whenever I'm in town.  We had worked together a long time ago, and we really hit it off back then, and have remained friends ever since.  The last time I was in town, we went out for drinks, and he had taken the opportunity to come out to me as bisexual. I was honored to be entrusted with this secret, and this time around, I intended to repay him with a secret of my of own.  I symbolically chose the same place he came out to me previously, but unfortunately, he B-lined for the bar, and between the bartender and the other patrons, there was little privacy.  After a couple of drinks, I suggested we go grab a booth, as the bar stools weren't all the comfortable, I lied.  Mercifully, he agreed.  After a couple minutes of conversation, I waited for a natural pause, and then I reminded him how a couple years prior he had entrusted me with a secret, at this very location.  I told him it was my turn to entrust him with a secret, and I came out to him as transgender.  ""Me too,"" she said, grinning ear to ear.

We spent some time trading notes, stories, etc. As it turns out, she wanted to tell me, but got cold feet, unsure of how I'd respond.  So, she strategically chose a location where it wouldn't be feasible to do so in order to take her mind off the idea of doing it. She was glad that I had taken the initiative, as obviously, it made it super easy for her.  We had a couple more drinks and then left in her car to drop me off at my hotel, excitedly swapping stories the entire way back.

In late January, early February, we travelled down to Florida to visit my best friend from high school (the one who was the first person I came out to).  She's got two kids the same age as my two kids, so it made trying to keep everyone entertained super easy.  She and I stayed up late one night to give each other mani/pedis and it was fabulous.  It was such an affirming activity, staying up late with my bestie doing each other's nails. I'm not out to my kids or to hers, but she slipped up once or twice and called me by my chosen name in front of her kids, who didn't take notice, but those were also really euphoric moments for me.  Her older daughter also saw me presenting female back in August when I had drunkenly video called.  She introduced me to her daughter as Cassie, and she didn't even question it.  She didn't care about my deep voice, or the fact that I was clearly wearing a wig.  She just immediately accepted that I was a woman, and a very good friend of her mom's.  She even met be before, as a man.  She didn't make the connection at all.  Kids are frickin' awesome.  I'm convinced that bigotry is a taught behavior.

In March, I started HRT.  It was a ridiculously simple process (YMMV, I live in a progressive area).  I just called up my local Planned Parenthood, explained the situation, and had an appointment scheduled a week after that 5 minute phone call.  I had pills in hand a day after the appointment.  Why did I wait so long?  So far, it's been a slow process, but I've got some small but noticeable breast growth.  My sense of smell has improved, and my body odor has decreased.  Every now and again, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and think, wow, my face has slimmed down and femmed up! But it's only been just under 3 months, so I figure it might just be my imagination.

March was also marked by probably the most transphobic reaction I've gotten so far.  My wife accidentally let it slip to her step-mother that I was transgender back in February.  Her step-mom is a dear, sweet lady who loves everyone, without regard to superficial details such as race, gender, sexuality, etc. She measures you based on who you are on the inside, which makes it quite surprising that she's married to my father-in-law, the worlds biggest asshole.  He's your typical man's man Fox News junky, who acknowledges only two points of view in this world:  his point of view, and wrong points of view.  He has been criticizing my wife for every decision she's made since she was legally old enough to make decisions on her own.  He's always felt that she married down, and he's not shy about voicing his backwards opinions on everything, no matter how insignificant.  We knew that it would be a shitshow when he learned my secret.  

Well, he happened to learn the same day I started HRT.  My step-mother-in-law, thinking that my wife had let her know in order to break the news to my father-in-law, did just that.  He promptly called up my wife, berated her yet again for marrying a loser (the worst thing you can be in his book, and ironic given that we've successfully been living on only my income for the past 4 years), and told her not to bring me around anymore. That's all fine and dandy, as I have never had any love for the man, but my son's birthday party was scheduled for literally the next week.  I'm not invited to his house, but he sees nothing wrong showing up to mine to spend time with his grandson and just pretending like I don't exist.  It was hella awkward.  It was also hilarious, because like, clearly the only person having a miserable time was him.  Somehow, he thinks he's hurting me by refusing to share with me his hot takes on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. How ever shall I carry on?

So, that whole ordeal sort of forced my hand, resulting in me coming out to much larger group than I would have been otherwise ready for, but in light of his knowledge of my being transgender, I was worried that he might cause a scene in front of a bunch of people who didn't know.  So, to get ahead of the story, I pretty much just came out to my entire friend group. They were all supportive.

Last month, my wife and I had an earnest talk about the future of our relationship, and while we've been heading down this path for a long time, we spelled it out officially -- we're getting a divorce.  It was mutual, and it's what's best for our kids and for us.  We each need things the other can't provide, and staying together for the sake of the kids will only result in anger and resentment.  We discussed what that looks like, everything from timelines to living arrangements to custody, and we have a verbal agreement that neither of us will try to make it difficult on the other, to prevent deepening of wounds.  That conversation wound up being a huge weight off both our shoulders, and the uncertainty around it was actually the source of a lot of the hurt that we'd caused each other over the past year.  Now that it's out in the open, things are great between us, at least platonically.  We can joke and laugh and have fun over our children and the things that brought us together again.  We're living life as roommates who just happen to have two children together.

So that's been the first year of my transition.  It's been a lot of ups and downs, but I feel like I'm on the right path.  Thanks to everyone who read this whole thing.  I know it's a lot, and probably not terribly interesting or important to anyone other than me.  But as Treebeard once said, ""Why say anything at all, if you can't take a very long time to say it?"""	"Thank you for sharing your story, warts and all. It's not often you get a ground level view of a long bit of time like this.
I couldn’t stop reading. I also read your initial coming out post and OMG you described my life so accurately.  I am so happy for you finding yourself after so long. My own experience has been a little bumpy and just due to being born in the wrong decade I had to suffer a little longer before coming out. But I am at least grateful that the world has finally become welcoming enough for me to live in it and that eventually I was able to find online information and support that allowed me to begin my life.

Thank you for taking the time to write this. Seeing other peoples experiences and how similar and different they can be is sometimes so helpful.
I'm glad you enjoyed the read! I wrote this about 5 months ago, and my life has continued to improve. I'm definitely on the right track (baby I was born this way). It's always great to hear from people who felt that I've left a positive impact on them, even in such a small way. Thanks for commenting!"	uo85rk	trans	14	0.86	2022-05-12 18:51:26
Have you noticed the trend where people intentionally misgender trans people if they do something bad? [tw: SA/abuse brief mention]	"I've seen it happen recently with a few non-binary celebrities and in a few news stories, in comment sections everywhere. The person in question does something reprehensible and suddenly everyone is misgendering them. And not just the obvious transphobes, but people who claim to support trans rights as well. I read people defending their comments by saying ""once you do something wrong, I'm not using your preferred pronouns, you've lost that courtesy"" as if that isn't completely transphobic. At first the best response I could come up with was, well no one does that to cis people so you're clearly only targeting trans folks, ergo transphobic and going against your claim that you support us. But that argument was lacking depth.

I've come to realize that people who engage in misgendering solely in cases where the individual has done something indefensible are actually always transphobic, just as bad as the constant, in-your-face ones out there. Defining the use of preferred pronouns as a ""courtesy"" instead of a simple human right shows that it's all superficial to them. They still adhere to the expectation in day-to-day interactions with trans people, because if not they risk backlash from those who would actually defend our right to our identities. But they don't believe in our identities no matter what they say. Then, as soon as the opportunity presents itself, they drop the façade. No one in their right mind is going to be jumping at the chance to defend a rapist, or a domestic abuser, or any other person who does something that bad. Thus, the closet transphobes see them as fair game and let their true colors shine through. And they expect everyone to just let them get away with it and buy into their half-assed excuses. In the end, they're not just hurting a good-for-nothing criminal who happens to be transgender, they're hurting all of us and slowing down our quest for human rights and equal treatment in society.

For me it's a hard situation to face. I'm always the first to correct someone when they mess up someone else's pronouns, whether by accident or intentionally. I've done it so much that it's almost reflex in conversation, and I have no shame in doing it. But, when faced with these people and their little loophole, I'm not sure what to say because all they hear is me defending an awful person. I guess part of me also gets that feeling, like I shouldn't be defending a bad person's identity because I shouldn't be defending anything about that person.

I don't know, maybe I'm just ranting and overreacting, but it feels like these people need to be shut down and I don't know how. I'd love to hear your thoughts/insights/feelings on this matter because my conversations about it with cis people haven't been productive.

Thank you for reading!

My dad won’t use my pronouns and it hurts	"TW: Transphobia


So I went to dinner with my dad last night bc 1) I hadn’t seen him in a long time and 2) I wanted to come out to him as trans. Thankfully I had my partner there for support, but what followed was a 2.5 hour long dinner in which I tried to explain what being trans meant to me and how I wanted to be referred to from here on out. I told him how being referred to as “he/him” and as his “son” made me uncomfortable and that I’d like to be referred to as “she/her” or “they/them” in the future. He basically said that he accepts who I am and still loves and respects me and will have my back no matter what, but he’s still going to continue calling me by masculine pronouns and that “it shouldn’t matter what people call you”. 

I’m not saying this to call him out or to make him feel bad by shaming him on a public forum, because that’s not how society should work. I’m saying this so hopefully it will help him or someone else reading this realize that misgendering someone, especially someone who is trans, can be harmful. You can say you love and respect someone all you want, but if you go against a simple thing like their pronouns because it’s “too hard”, how much do you really?

I know that someone asking for you to change the pronouns you use for them is hard. It definitely takes time, especially if it’s someone you’ve known for a while, or even all their life. I can’t speak for all trans people, but I know I would never get mad at someone for misgendering or deadnaming me if I had JUST told them my new name and pronouns. I know it takes time, and all I ask for is a conscious effort to try and change, even if it takes you months or even years to fully make the switch.

My dad misgendering me throughout dinner wasn’t what made me upset enough to write this post. It was when he said “I’m gonna be blunt for a second, but I want to be honest with you. I’m still going to keep calling you by he and him because that’s how I know you as and you can’t change how I see you.” That stung and it stuck with me. You can’t say you accept me for who I am and then in the very next sentence say you’re not going to respect how I want to be called because it’s not convenient for you. Last time we had a big argument about how he treated me, it took me threatening to cut him out of my life to make him change his ways. I really hope it doesn’t come to that again.


To all of you out there that do respect my pronouns, thank you. I love and appreciate each and every one of you. 💙💖🤍💖💙"	"""You can’t say you accept me for who I am and then in the very next sentence say you’re not going to respect how I want to be called because it’s not convenient for you.""

This is absolutely true. He does seem like he loves you and is open minded though, perhaps he just needs some time, exposure and education. I hope it doesn't come to you having the threaten to cut him out either. Best of luck to you, dear : )
Maybe it’ll be easier as your appearance evolves.
my dad had, while not as bad, a similar reaction when i first told him. stuff like ""i see you as my son and that's it"" i also heard from him and i was just having lunch with him alone (happy you didn't make that mistake). It hurt me pretty badly and as I was questioning then, i spent 2 days doubting myself again without getting much sleep.

But he just needed time. By now (1 year later) he uses the correct pronouns mostly and calls me his daughter. As you're dad seems supportive like mine i am sure some time and education will help.
Thank you!
Hopefully, I already dress pretty femme."	s0nymf	trans	15	0.86	2022-01-10 16:28:30
How do I help him?(long post)	"My husband is trans(ftm) and his family is a nightmare. He came out when he was 19 and his family was horrified, like he had said he killed the neighbors dog. He has come out 3 times since then and is now 30. They still call him by his dead name and use she/her pronouns. 
We have been together 5 years and in those 5 years I have heard it all. ""Why can't you just be a lesbian?"" ""You are a girl, it's the way God made you."" ""I'm sorry but you will always be a girl to me."" ""It's a shame you turned into a lesbian, now you say something like this."" ""Maybe you should pray on it, God can help you not feel like this."" I'm honestly sick of it and I know he is as well. His mom's husband even went as far to say... In front of me, ""it's not to late to find yourself the right man and settle down. Don't you want to be happy and  normal?"" 
Now flash forward to when we got married last year in Florida. it was just our mom's with us and my mom is very very supportive of my husband. She will correct people and go out of her way to compliment him. With it just being the 4 of us I think my husbands mother saw this and being the sheep she is, started calling him his male name and using he/him pronouns. She even said she was the mother of the groom. He was over joyed and thought finally. He had the chance and took many of them to tell her how he felt. She seemed to listen and realize that he had felt this way even at a very young age. When he told her everything, she cried. She called his grandma and said how bad she felt that she never saw it. They talked about it and we thought omg finally!!! 
But as soon as we went back home.... It was right back to his dead name and she/her. 
His mother said it was because ""nobody knew him that way, and it's just going to be easier to not have to explain"". It's honestly sad because in a way his family has pushed him back into the closet. It's was like that week in Florida never even happened. 
He is forced to use his dead name and pronouns around his family and others. I just don't understand and I'm trying really hard not to get mad at this. I try to be very supportive and I would do anything to make him happy. But at some point you just kinda gotta ask why. Sometimes I feel like they do it just to spite him. I well say he and in the same breath they say she/her......
What do I do? What do I say? Can I do anything? Or is it up to him? Help me!"	Really just being supportive helps but I think he is going to have to realize he needs to cut contact with his family. It sounds like they are a bunch of bigots who will never give him the respect he deserves. There’s really no point in wasting any more time on them. Although I do understand its really hard to go through with it but isn’t him sparing himself all that pain worth it? He deserves to be respected as the man he is.	vnamz8	trans	14	0.94	2022-06-29 08:17:22
First hard breakdown during HRT.	"Lasted about a good hour to two hours. Thought I'd document it here.

So a little backstory about me. I'm 31 MtF, been on HRT for about three months (started when I was thirty, but honestly its kind of a nebulous area with dates for me). I've got a bunch of old acne scars (from old self-harm days), though those (I know) only take a little makeup once I get the funds together to purchase some. I don't look the most feminine; in fact, to date the only feminine things about me are my hair and waist curvature, which I've thankfully maintained since I was twelve and trying to figure this shit out (yes, it took me eighteen goddamn years). I've also gained a meager amount of titflesh, which is nice. Also, still living with my parents. That's a story for another time.

Anyway, today was kind of a trainwreck. A scheduled laser consultation (to find out if it can even help with my hair color) at 5, housekeeper comes at 12. Dad comes in, suggests we go out and get a bite to eat while HK does her magic dusting thing. We bounce after establishing that I'm broke (first gaffs, corsetry and bras ain't cheap, yo, gotta get them when the dough is floating) and its on his dime.

Hit up a kind of low-tier would-be classy place, relax, eat food, etc. I'm not presenting in any way other than my hair and voice, and I try to be pretty chill about pronouns and junk. It isn't my way to interrupt flow or try to jam a crowbar in a conversation that would otherwise last five seconds then leave us both feeling awkward.

Anyway, its going fine- up until the point dad starts talking about his family; one of my grandmas and how she's doing, his family tree, and specifically how many suicides he's had in his family tree. Wonderful topics (clap clap). Especially considering this is the same grandma that only a few years ago was, around thanksgiving, telling me she was ready to stop living while I was trying to relax away from the crowd with a quiet cig (social anxiety coupled with minor dysphoria and primary-introvert personality. That's me).

I try not to engage and worked to change topic, but it felt weird. Wouldn't it, for you?

Anyway, about a half hour's gone by, so we finish eating and hop back in the car to go home so I can get ready for laser. ...And the conversation picks up where he left off before, this time about people getting older- like how he's 'twenty years from the average male death' (he's fifty-something), and how he wants to keep working until he kicks the bucket, so he's getting his master's (for the record, I'll be working to get an associate's here soon), yadda yadda, but he keeps hammering this one point- that the 'average male lifespan is seventy-five years'. Now he's a nurse- this kind of statistics shit (something I hold with derison) is his bread and butter, but me? I can't help but shut down. Fucking dying inside, for the first time since starting HRT.

Can't get it out of my head how I should have sprung on this when I was twelve, how I effectively never was a teenager because I never got that angsty 16-year-old girl feels, how I never *will*, how by the time I'm actually the chick outside that I am inside I'll be halfway dead, how I've already had a bit of receding hairline (it isn't bad, my long hair covers it, but I gotta wear a hat when its windy), etc. etc. etc.

And I can't help but put my face in my hands just for some feeling of support. Not crying, mind you. I don't cry. But the only emotion in me right then and there is dread. Not sorrow (that feels different to me. I dunno what, specifically, I was dreading), but dread.

Dad looks over, asks me if I'm okay, I ask (politely as I can. I was pretty shaken, it might have sounded crazier than I wanted it to) for a subject change, or that I can get out and walk home, and he says okay, we'll just go straight home instead of through the car wash. And immediately revs the engine, jumping from 0mph at a stop light to somewhere around 40-50, the wheels swerving as they tried to grip. To be fair, it was a semi-empty road. And we were in mom's sportscar, so maybe he just wanted to have fun with it?

Now its no secret I've had a huge amount of anxiety, ever since I had a bit of a mental breakdown at College Attempt 1. This has lessened a lot (read: 80%) since starting estro, but I can still be a little easy to set off at times with paranoia or worries. Right here, right now, I felt myself crawling up the back of the seat. I don't even know if I said anything, that's how messed up I was right then and there. I still feel it a little, sitting down and writing this up.

""What's wrong with you? Maybe you should talk to your therapist about getting something for your anxiety.""

I didn't even know what to say. Right then and there, I wanted to scream, cry, run and strangle him all at the same time. I literally did not know what to do. He tells me later that he feels like he's walking on eggshells when talking to me, which I don't understand. Maybe he wants someone he can talk to about death and shit all the time? idk. Did I overreact? Am I overthinking this? Is this just all one weird coincidence that got strung together in my head to become despair, or was there some point here that I missed?

But yeah. I'm writing this so that, at some point, I can look back on it with maybe a little more knowledge. And so I can write down this next bit.

I do know one thing. One very, very strange and important thing. One thing of such magnitude that I cannot forget or ignore it, because it is a good thing to come out of a shit day. I have discovered my will to live. Before all this, I was in a daze, learning little and knowing less, likely because my head was filled up with questions I was rejecting the answer to, and it was sapping my interest in survival. I don't think I even registered what it left behind as suicidal thoughts- just emptiness.

But if, in a vehicle I can't control, I suddenly claw my way up the back of the seat out of fear for the way its driving? I know I don't want to die anymore, if I ever did. I feel a need to live, now, if ever. All signs point to this being the right course, even if I started late.

I am so Angry rightnow my best friend just totally ripped my heart out because of how he responded to my sharing this article on fb😢😢😢😥😡😡😡😤	"So i just posted this article on my facebook acount that i am still not out on, and my best friend of almost 20 years who just recently became part of the lds church responded with saying ""being any part of the lgbtqia+community means you have a mental illness and if one of your family members had a mental illness wouldnt you want to help them"" i do understand he can have his own opinion, but being lgbtqia+ is not a mental illness and conversion therapy by shaming and shock therapy is not going to help anybody. Im pissed and can barely breath rightnow

There is no way to reason with him and you're better off finding new friends than trying to change his beliefs.
Religion is a mental illness. Get your friend help.

&#x200B;

EDIT: and LDS is a cult.
I'm ex mormon and I can't believe people are still actually joining this church. And I'm also so mad that these harmful beliefs are affecting others even outside the church. Ughhhh
I know people can have their beliefs and values, but as soon as those values support actively hurting people who have done nothing to harm others, MY personal beliefs and values tell me that it's okay to cut that toxic sack of shit out of my life. 

Not only is conversion therapy disgusting as fuck, it also doesn't work. 

That makes people who believe in it not just assholes, but dumb, uninformed assholes.

I'm sorry you had to receive written proof of hos idiocy. Several of my braincells comitted suicide just reading this secondhand in your post, you must have a giant headache.

Please do not take his response to heart. Unfortunately there's no real therapy for stupidity except education, and a symptom of this particular condition is the utter refusal to educate themselves or the pure ignorance of facts.

You are NOT mentally ill. Obviously. Not sure about him though.
Let's say you are diagnosed with dysphoria. It's not a disorder no matter hour much your friend dislikes it. If your friend cannot out aside their bias, they might not ever. There's no guaranteed method to change your friends mind, but you're obviously more than welcome to try if you want to preserve the friendship.

You should understand the possibility exists that they will *never* change their mind however. If that's the case, you need to cut them out. It's like putting alcohol on a wound - it's gonna hurt a whole lot at first, but you need to do it or you will only feel worse over time.
Thank you and I feel the same way
All religions are cults. But especially the LDS Church. When you know that your founding member was a con man and still you believe this bullshit... 😑
Thank you, it is sad to see and deal with
Thank you so mich❤❤❤

Worries about transgender child solved.	"I've grown up in a very conservative, religious environment (Mormon). I recently left the church because of its treatment of minorities (and also its messed up history proves that it's false).   
Since then I've been trying to work through all kinds of difficulties that a life of indoctrination produced.  
As such, I had a fear of trans people, especially trans women. I learned that the fear steamed from my confusion at being attracted to someone that I had still considered a man. I unraveled that, and now accept trans women as beautiful, and as 100% women. Of course I'd be attracted to women.   
I even managed to unravel my implicit personal fear of being attracted to men too. If someone is attractive, they are attractive. I don't need to guard my cis identity, because there is no shame in it being different (contrary to the ""gays go to hell"" stuff I was taught).   
Though I had long accepted that I would support my child if they were gay or lesbian-- until recently, I was mentally worried about them being trans.   
I want them to have a choice in their gender identity. But if they decided to transition hormonally before puberty- I was worried that they'd be much too young to make a decision. What if they blamed me for not challenging them, or what if their gender dysphoria was temporary?   
Now, none of this is probably going to happen. If they want to transition, they probably won't regret it, or may be an obvious part of who they are since birth. But I want to make sure that I do things right for them. So I want to be prepared in every case.  
  
For example, if my child wants to transition as early at 10-- and it seems like a very recent development, I  worried that 10 is too young of an age to make such a big decision. At the same time, I would want to support them and not deal with having do undo hormone effects of their birth sex later on through surgery.  

Well the thing that solved my worries was understanding hormone blockers.   
In the example case, after some discussion, we have the option of suspending sex specific puberty changes for a few years. That way an immediate decision isn't necessary, and they can make that decision between 10-16 years old.   
I know that concern is very specific, and maybe my solution isn't affirming or has other flaws-- but it helps knowing that there isn't a single moment where a decision has to be made.   
I think if other parents understood this, then it would help a lot more trans children.   
   
If my thinking still has some implied transphobia or other flaw, please let me know. I have had 24 years of bigotry to sift through, and I know there's still plenty left.   
Thanks for letting me post here."	Blockers are great. The risks of them are so low and it doesn't actually cause any changes. I realised I was trans at 12 but have only started my transition now at 25 because there was no one to support me or who i could talk to honestly. I would do anything to go back in time and go on blockers.	npw9bn	trans	12	0.85	2021-06-01 15:12:18
Odd for me to say but I had a dream...	"I actually had a dream the other night in which I was a transgender individual. I remembered being ridiculed, accused of being a drug addict, I remembered the fear and shame I had to deal with, in the dream my mother called me ""one of them"". 

I've done a lot of self development work which has taught me that I either associate pain or pleasure to an activity. This dream made me realize that people recognize more pain by hiding who they are than by holding in all the time. I've never been prejudiced but the feelings I felt let me understand how brave you are. At the end of the dream I remember meeting someone who accepted me, who loved me for who I was and who took me away from the teasing and hatred I had encountered.

Long story short, I lived the life for a bit I suppose and while I'll never really understand, I guess I kind of understand. Thank all of you brave people for going forward, don't stop and if you ever need support I am totally here and ready to help."		4izc4e	trans	16	1.0	2016-05-12 06:12:16
Thoughts about HRT, being trans, and mandatory RLE	"Before 3 years ago I had no idea that I was transgender. For almost 50 years I just thought I was weird and permanently unhappy and tried to suppress those thoughts. Then I found the wiki definition of the term “gender dysphoria”, and suddenly the lights came on, illuminating many of the odd experiences and feelings I’d had since childhood.

For several months I processed the concept, not sure if or how to proceed. As time went by, I became more and more certain that this was what I’d been experiencing since childhood, based on googling and forums in spare moments of the day. But I come from a conservative family in a conservative state, where even being gay when I grew up would make you a target of derision. So I was afraid, and for several months couldn’t summon the courage to take action. 

As my awareness of the dysphoria and depression increased, I did thought experiments, “what if...”. My resolve gradually increased, and I finally decided to go to counseling to further explore the possibility.  

I went to 6 one-hour counseling sessions with a “gender therapist”.  This was the sort of counselor who used the ridiculous technique of staring at you until you started talking, about something, anything. 

During this time, on my own, I began exploring wearing small bits of female clothing in public. Little things like a bit of jewelry, or extra long women’s jeans. I was so happy when I got my first women’s boots. (Somewhat gender-neutral in retrospect.) So I kind of did a little of my own RLE, just because it felt good. No, it felt awesome. But never super femme, I just started moving towards a more gender-neutral style.

Finally after 6 sessions, the “counselor” made an offhand comment at the end of the session that she didn’t think I was a “good candidate” for HRT. 

That was extremely disconcerting to me. I’d already felt uncomfortable talking to her, and now she made me feel like I was on trial, trying to prove I was trans. I’m not the sort of person who likes for other people to tell me how to live, so I started googling. Eventually I came across the term “Informed Consent”. More light bulbs came on. 

By this time I’d sort of become invested in the knowledge that I was trans. I couldn’t let it go. I was too unhappy with how my appearance was even further masculinizing as I grew older, and saw no other path forward to a happy life. But I still wasn’t certain that I should start taking hormones - what would my parents think? My friends, my workplace, my spouse? Eventually I settled on the idea that I could hide the breast growth for a few weeks (ironic in hindsight), to give me a chance to figure out those pieces of the puzzle. I was still not certain that I should start HRT.

So I started calling around to IC clinics, and eventually made an appointment. On the evening before the appointment, I asked my spouse to confirm that she really for certain did not ever want to have kids with me.

At the clinic I go to, you must first speak with a free counselor for about an hour to make sure you fully understand the consequences and are mentally capable of consenting. Then a physician comes in and you talk for another hour or so, and at the end you walk away with a prescription. 

As I drove back to my home town, prescription in hand, my level of excitement grew, and so did my resolve. I went into the pharmacy, and got a couple of puzzled glances when they read the prescription. But they gave me the pills and I walked back to my car in a slight rain, and simultaneous sunshine, oddly enough. I felt like I was floating. Then I just sat in the car, clenching the bottle in my hand, crying and thanking God for letting me reach that day. (If that sounds sappy - too bad, your problem.) I took a double dose sitting right there in the car, shame on me :)

From that point on, I never had any thought of stopping HRT. I had a very mannish appearance, but the way I approached it was to very gradually change the way I dressed, keeping in pace with the changes the hormones precipitated in my appearance. 

I was never bold. At no point did I ever dress in a way to make me feel the slightest discomfort. The only bold leap I made was the first day I carried a purse lol. This is something that INFURIATES me about the idea of mandatory RLE - who the fuck is the arbiter of how a woman must dress!!? Utter drivel. A woman can dress any way she wants to!! A mandatory RLE requirement is ridiculous and draconian. 

As I added little bits here and there, one of my friends teased me that one day I would come to work in a skirt. I said, “no way, I prefer sort of a butch style”.

Almost one year later to the day, I came to work in a skirt as he predicted, completely confident, not the slightest discomfort. I think I made a joking apology. He looked at me in the hall and said, “you made the right decision”. I’ll never forget that moment.

The reason I take hormones is not because of how it makes me look. It’s because of how it makes me FEEL. As an added benefit, I get to wear the clothing I’m comfortable in every day.

"	"FWIW, RLE is no longer mandatory to start HRT. WPATH even removed that from their recommended guidelines in the last Standards of Care. That's one of the reasons more and more informed consent clinics exist now, at least in the US. It's unfortunate that there are still a lot of therapists who either require RLE because they're gate-keepy, or because they're too lazy to actually keep up with modern trans healthcare protocols, but they're quickly becoming a thing of the past.

How do you guys cope with, like... everything?	"Hi there. I'm 23, MtF pre-transition. I started questioning my gender identity when I was 16 and by 19 accepted that I'm trans. It felt like a huge eye opener. Things about myself that always felt out of place, insecurities, fears, wishes, all started to make sense and fit like pieces of a puzzle. For a moment I thought ""well, this changes everything. I'm finally starting to understand myself, so it's all uphill from here"". But now I'm starting to feel real cynical about it.

First off, I can't start HRT yet due to my living situation with my parents and it feels like I'm losing precious time I'm never going to get back. But at the same time, I don't think I'm ever going to really pass. I'm 6ft/1,85m tall and have relatively wide shoulders, and no mount of HRT is ever going to change that. It feels like I'm bound to spend the rest of my life looking like someone wearing an ill-fitting skin-suit, trying to be something they aren't. Don't feel comfortable and don't want to be in male spaces, but also don't really feel completely comfortable in female spaces, where it's always like I'm the odd one out trying to fit in, trying to make up for something that I really cannot.

To top things off, I'm a lesbian and feel, mostly, attracted to other butch lesbians, who I don't think will ever be attracted to me since attraction is physical and I'm, well, not physically feminine. Like I'm bound to be always be into people who will only ever see me as an eyesore. My love life is completely stagnated and I don't even know how to change that, since it seems I'm never confident enough to actually think other people might feel attracted to me. I see all my sapphic friends around me meeting other girls, hooking up, etc. while I'm left behind, alone. Feels like I'm just a footnote in everyone's story.

It shames me to say but for the first time in years Ive started questioning again what's even the point of being alive. My big dream is something unachievable and I feel just absolutely unlovable. Why even be alive if everything I want is unobtainable? Do any of you also feel like this? I don't think my cis friends do or ever could understand how it feels. I just feel so alone in all of this..."	"Being a little taller or having a normal body shape that happens to go against conventional beauty standards doesn't mean shit, and HRT makes the biggest fucking difference. Like really, it's incredible how much it helps your body and mind. Also, butch women aren't always looking for femmes, butches can date butches. And you probably don't even come across as ""butch"" just because you're not hyperfeminine or whatever, there's a lot of middle ground, and HRT will definitely change where someone might place you on the scale

I will say, no HRT at 23 really sucks, I was suicidal literally every day for multiple years because of it, I had to just yeet my ass halfway across the country and go no-contact and never see my dog to get away from the transphobic hellhole I was in and start my girl juice. It was a lot. But people have transitioned far older than you and looked good, trust me, it'll be alright

To actually answer the question? I don't cope with anything. I never learned how. I just transitioned and got a few girlfriends and now I'm kinda hot and it's great
Watch videos, listen to music or podcast, read, prepare a healthy meal for yourself, talk to your supportive friends or parents, sleep, bath, workout like there is no tomorrow. Rinse and repeat. Basically just live and enjoy your life. Sometimes the harder you try to change or please others the tougher life will become for you. Just breath and take it slow and easy.

I'd like to say a HUGE thanks to my Youth Worker! (he/they, 13)	"so uumm. I'm autistic, I have ADHD, and uh. I'm trans/non-binary and bi. I've liked the opposite gender since I was 10 but, hey, no, we DENY. Deny. dennyyy. (just deny it.) 

But um, yeah. 

I came out to my auntie as non-binary/ transman when I was 11...maybe younger? But she's always respected me and was so nice about it!

I then told my youth worker, and... He's just so supportive!! 
Today I didn't go to school. I couldn't. I can't. I can't deal with my chest in a school uniform. I know it sounds silly, but I'm so used to being at a non-mainstream school, where I'm allowed to just hide in my huge MCR hoodie, and black jeans, and Vans or Converse, and I felt alot more free. 

I've been trying for ages to get into a mainstream, and now I've gone and fucked it up! 

I have a 2 week trial here, if I don't like it, I go back to my other school/specialist school. And I am NOT doing that, because I am really far behind on my work and everything. I don't even know how to do fractions, because at the other school we didn't really have lessons.

My Youth worker text me a few min ago, ""I hear today was a struggle. What's the biggest problem?"" I said ""I don't wanna wear the top. I don't like my chest, and I can't do anything about it. idk if that makes sense?"" He said ""Yeah if makes sense. Whats a possible soulution?"" ""none"" ""There has to be, just might not be easy or simple solutions.   I can understand why it's difficult but it would be a shame for the trial not to go well because of it""   ""But I can't do anything about it, so I can't go to school."" and he asked for a chat in 30min.


Edit: So we just called. I basically told him how it makes me stress, and that I can't do anything. At this point I wanted to sh. Then he was saying that he'll speak to the teacher for me, because I literally cannot speak to people about stuff like that... It's so hard, and I feel so wrong for it.. Anywayy, we was talking about possible solutions, he said surgery. But we both agreed that I couldn't do that. He said about a binder, but I said again about the issue that Mum won't let me have one. He said he'll try speak to her, and give her good points on a binder for me to tell her, and he'll resarch it. 
He says to try focus on this 2 week trial, because then they'll see I'm capable of a mainstream, and I might be able to move. idk. But I hope he's right. 

I swear, he's the only one I'll speak to. Out of all these Chams people, and social workers (i don't know whos who anymore!). He has good taste in music, too! He likes linkin park."		n93av9	trans	14	0.94	2021-05-10 12:30:43
Every day I'm submitting an example of /r/the_donald's harassment of transgender people to /r/enoughtrumpspam. Here's a summary of the SECOND week	"[Link to the FIRST week](https://np.reddit.com/r/EnoughTrumpSpam/comments/4ph72a/every_day_im_submitting_an_example_of_rthe/)
*****

Every day I post an instance where /r/the_donald harassed or threatened violence against transgender individuals. This is going to continue for a long time because there is so much transgender hatred on that subreddit.


/r/the_donald is one of the largest transgender hate forums on the internet. /r/the_donald should be really named /r/transgender_people_hate because so much of their content is just [transgender hate and it doesn't have anything to do with Trump. ](http://archive.is/KKYcG)

 They've gotten away with this everyday for months while being the most visible subreddit on the site. It's pretty disgusting how this site harbors one of the largest transgender hate forums on the internet. This harassment and especially these threats of violence should be breaking site rules.

Here's a message one user sent to the admins in response to the FIRST week.

>""How can reddit without a hint of self awareness, pretend to care about LGBT rights or pride month when you allow /r/the_donald to post BLATANT threats against transgender people, engage in harassment of transgender and shame them at every turn. How can you do this to the trans people on reddit? 

>How can you find it okay to let this abuse towards one of the most marginalised groups in the world go on and on and on unchecked on your website, while at the same time claiming you give a shit about Pride month? 

>How does this happen? What sense does this make you?""

"	"Notice they always refer to transgender people as ""it"" or derogatory terms like ""freak"". They're dehumanizing transgender people... How is it okay for reddit to give a platform to this?

Message the admins about this.
Am I the only one around here who thinks that they shouldn't be bothered by the admins as long as they're not brigading other subreddits orspamming/doxxing users?
While their attitudes are disgusting; they are within their own space, and they have a right to free speech. We do not live in a society where we criminalize thought; as horrid as the thoughts may be. The moment you refuse to defend the speech of those you hate, you've lost the right to defend your own.
Because the whole point of Reddit is that anyone can have a community as long as they're not actively harassing and targeting users outside their bubble. That goes for people we don't like. I'm sure they don't like the things we say either.
I prefer they have their own little space, rather than released into the wild.

Easier to find the ones that do need reporting as well (direct threat of violence, doxxing, and harassment)
Harassing people, especially because of their identity should not be protected as free speech



>[My cousin just decided he is transgender...](http://i.imgur.com/cyYf6YR.jpg)[+20]

>He forgot #Mentaldisorder
I agree with you, as absolutely horrifying this stuff is, there should remain a huge importance placed on free speech on the Internet
I'm with ya. If anything, these posts make it more of a problem than it would be, by placing them in my feed instead of letting them stay in the echo chamber for a candidate for a presidential vote I don't give a shit about. 
yes
Free speech doesn't cover harassment and threats of violence
THANK you.

>He forgot #Mentaldisorder
That's a really good point too. I hadnt even considered that.
FUCK THEIR FREE SPEECH, THEY'LITERALLY ADVOCATING VIOLENCE AGAINST US
Already got a second and a third, so you're late to the party. These posts are more fucking annoying than the stuff they're pointing out. They concentrate it all in one fucking place, and unlike posts in The Donald, I see these posts. I'm not subbed to The Donald. We have our bubble. They have theirs. 
It also doesn't extend to a private company's forum; they're free to censor as they see fit.
Then take the issue up with the admins with THAT USER, because as idiotic as I consider their entire subreddit to be, overall it has a right to exist.
Free speech doesn't cover hate speech or violence thankfully
unfortunately I didn't look too in depth at the comments, but if they're actually advocating violence, thats where the line has to be drawn.
You think I don't know that? I advocate for self defense. Justified or not, that can be violent. If one of these people attacked me I'd cut them until they got off me then choke them out so they wouldn't be going anywhere.

I wrote ""THIS STICK KILLS FASCISTS"" on my drum sticks. That could very easily mean advocating violence, and while it's ambiguous, people tend to let it slide because most people don't like fascists.

If that slogan isn't good enough of an example, how about the sticker I got at a show that says ""Save a life. Kill a supremacist!"" on it?
They're also free not to.
They do. Multiple times.

They also doxed a trans person by posting their facebook account + face while mocking them. Their own cousin did this.
Then why are you defending their right _to advocate violence against us._
alright then, fuck them.
Did you even read my comment? You responded with a one liner that's almost exactly what you already said. If one of these people showed up to a punk show, theyd probably get *hurt,* fast, and I wouldn't feel sorry for them. I have no fucking sympathy for them. But I am very, VERY anti censorship, and I don't compromise my morals because I don't like someone. If we want them to shut up, we'll have to get them to stop by doing our own advocacy, not by just sweeping them under the rug and letting them lay eggs there. If you believe in censorship then you have every right to feel that way, but I don't and my morals apply to everyone, not just people saying stuff I like. Fuck censorship.
They would not even think of extending the same courtesy to you. Not in a thousand years.
Oh, I'm sorry, you must have missed the part where *I don't give a single fucking shit,* because guess what? Still not gonna compromise my morals.
Wow you give such a shit that youre arguing about it
>  If we want them to shut up, we'll have to get them to stop by doing our own advocacy, not by just sweeping them under the rug and letting them lay eggs there.

I don't agree with letting literal calls for violence go unsilenced. I believe they need to be clamped down upon and punished. Nazis IMO have no right to parade out their rhetoric in the streets, but i agree that this is also the path that needs to be taken to ensure victory in the longterm.
Compromise your beliefs if you want. You're obviously just employing shit-tactics now. What I said was *obviously* in regard to whether or not some extends the same ""courtesy"" to me as I do them, and you damn well knew that. If you disagree with my morals or think I should be looser with them, say that instead of just shifting shit around to try and subtly insult me."	4qmky4	trans	14	0.81	2016-06-30 16:29:02
Is it normal to feel guilty about my pronouns?	"I’m Non-Binary. 22.

I only recently came to terms with my gender fluidity, but I’m not exactly “out” about it. Only a handful of my close friends know.

Is it normal to feel like I’m asking too much for people to call me “they/them”?

I’m not super specific about my pronouns. I wouldn’t care if someone referred to me as “she/her” “they/them” or “he/him”.

I’m very literally “just whatever” lol.

But recently I’ve been putting a lot of thought into it, and I would prefer “they/them” as a kind of neutral between the two, as I bounce back and forth between feminine presenting and masculine presenting.

But every time I think about telling my girlfriend that I don’t want to strictly be referred to as a man, I feel shameful, almost sick. It feels similar to when I was denying my gender waaaay back when I was 12-13.

Is this normal? Should I just say fuck it and force myself to do it? Or should I wait it out and see if I accept it like I did initially with my gender identity?

Thank you if you took the time to read this! It is much appreciated!

Also Rest in Peace to all those who lost their lives in Colorado Springs yesterday. I cried when I got that news. I hope the friends and family are staying safe and staying close. It’s so sad."	"If it makes you feel any better - 

I told my gf i was agender and preferred any pronouns.

Then later I told her I preferred they/them 

Then later I told her i preferred she/they. 

Then, finally, I told her i preferred she/her. 

You don't have to change as much as i did, but don't feel guilty for keeping your partner informed on your transition 🥰
Tysm!! This made me smile lol. I’m not even sure if it’s shame or guilt that I’m feeling. It just feels like I’m repressing things again. It took me 10 years to come out to anyone about being gender queer and it took 9 of those year for me to admit it to myself. It’s just a very unpleasant yet familiar feeling. :/ it just sucks"	z0wdta	trans	13	0.88	2022-11-21 11:13:16
“Valid” People Taking L’s (TW)	"As you all may know, there is a twitter account going around and posting stuff from a few different trans subs. r/ftm r/mtf r/trans are all being targeted right now, especially people who post selfies on those places. Another account going by the name terftastic1 (I'm pretty sure) is going onto Or/phallo and body shaming people who had the phallo plastic surgery, and they're misgendering them too. Trans women who post selfies are being made fun of, especially those who don’t “pass.” These people can dig for information about trans people so they can harass them and send things like death threats. Remember folks, please stay safe, don't give out sensitive information online and if you post something, it will be on the internet forever. And for mental health's sake block these accounts (or just don't even go onto twitter it is a real hellhole). When you feed yourself negative stuff like that, it is basically digital and phycological self harm. The internet is a dangerous place.

Ps: I saw something about the owner of the ValidLs account being a sex offender. His name is Matthew Benson. The account @aydenthehusky posted his mugshot. Get a load of that (if it is true)!

Seeking Information	"Hello!

I am the aunt of a 20 year old trans man. He came out at 13 as trans and has been living as male for over 5 years, with (mostly) the complete support of his family.  I am attempting to help him as much as I can and am appealing for help and information.  We are in NW Ohio if that matters as far as the info I'm requesting.  He is aware of and completely comfortable with me posting the info below - 

I will not go in to the issues and my opinions of his mother, other than to say that 2 times in February 2021 she put him in the hospital on psych holds and the second time she called family members, including me, and told us ""for the love of god, don't let him live with you. he needs to hit bottom and get help and you taking him in won't help.""  She let social services send him to a shelter, and fortunately he moved in with a friend rather than go there.  To my everlasting shame, I allowed this to happen, but the friend situation did not work out, and I immediately told him he could live with me - but there would be rules and conditions (I'm in therapy myself for depression/anxiety - mostly related to the recent situations). 

Anyway - I could not be more proud of him and what he is doing!  In about 4 or 5 weeks he has 

1) gotten his GED - he was encouraged (IMO) to drop out of school at 16 and his mother had excuse after excuse as to why he couldn't take the test

2) gotten all his papers (state ID/social security/birth certificate etc) in order

3) interviewed and got a job - and a decent one - at a place that is his dream location (not the dream job but its a foot in the door) - he starts next week.

4) maintained stable moods, followed every condition set for him here as far as household duties, attending therapy virtually, all that stuff.

and we are working at getting him his own place when he's ready.  He is socially immature for his age and is not at this time ready or able to live on his own - but he'll get there soon!

&#x200B;

So I am so proud of him and happy about how things are going. 

HOWEVER - 

Here is where I (we) need help.  I am basically ignorant about his needs. He wants to start Testosterone asap and work toward having his top surgery and then work on changing his name and such legally.

Any advice as to first steps on basic legal procedures on name changing and changing his legal gender to male (sorry if not phrased correctly)

Any and all info about basic medical things - testosterone therapy/top surgery etc that he has is really old and has filtered through his mother medically - and I've already found that she is not the most... reliable... of sources. He has never seen ANY doctor or therapist specializing in treating trans adolescents/adults.

She has advised him that he can not , with any coverage, get testosterone therapy paid for by medical insurance? b (he has medicaid and private insurance both)  
Anyone in our  basic area who can point me toward a good trans--specific team of therapists/doctors - we'd be eternally grateful.  We are willing to go as far east as Cleveland, as far north as Ann Arbor/Detroit, as far south as Columbus (my therapist is looking for us to find the proper people too.)

Also - he has PCOS and very heavy/problematic menstrual cycles which, notwithstanding how uncomfortable they are physically, play hell with his mind - how much more dysphoric can you get?

Everything suggested by his OB (we are searching for a trans-friendly OB BTW) has estrogen in it - and he is not willing to take even minimal estrogen.

Does anyone have experience that can help us there?

Any/all assistance appreciated! and thanks for reading the novel above."	"I'm not within the same state, but I can definitely help. Some insurance companies do in fact cover all of that, all that needs to be done is call and talk to the insurance about what they cover and what they don't. He can get his gender marker for his ID done at the DMV. I'm not sure how it runs there but it was a simple progress for me. Name change I believe is through the courts, not sure if it has to be the state he was born in though. I'm not sure if any of this helps, but I hope it does. Oh, and most insurance companies require someone to be on HRT for a year before they will do any surgeries. They do like to do top surgery after the person has been on HRT for awhile due to the chest could potentially grow back. Which is why I haven't gotten mine done yet. Best of luck through this
I would look into informed consent clinics or any planned parenthoods around they will help get hormones without needing a bunch of letters from therapists.. Though, I highly suggest therapy because it will help a lot with stress and factors that can happen with hormones.

A lot of insurances cover at least part of the testosterone or even all of it so don't let that person tell you guys that! Surgeries is a different story and really depends on the insurance company and their policies. Some cover partial some cover all and some cover none. You just have to go through and look at your insurance policies a lot will have a ""trans health"" section and if not, call the company and flat out ask. 

With top surgery, you gotta be on hormones for a year or two because your body changes a lot on hormones. A lot of insurance companies that do help cover will normally require one or two letters following WPATH guidelines to get surgery. Once again, best to call and talk to the insurance company to see what they cover/don't and what you need to go through.

For name change, its normally something you file with the county/state at the court house and you will get a court hearing. The judge will ask why you wanna change your name etc and then they will tell you to put your name in the paper for a certain amount of time and once thats done, go back and they should change it. Once you have your name change paper work, go to the SS building and get another SS card and once that, you can use that and your paperwork to get a new license with the gender marker also changed (normally IDK I have heard some DMVS not wanting to and some that will so just gotta find one that will or fight for it. I  haven't gotten that far yet). 

I am a trans guy that also has endo and PCOS and if you can't do HRT right away I highly suggest the nexaplanon it won't put any unnecessary estrogen on your body and stops your periods. May not stop the cramps totally but they will be much better (I have that and on HRT with no issues) but once you get on hormones periods tend to lighten and even stop after a while. IDK how long it takes cause I have always had some sort of BC when I have been on hormones and had no periods. I would also look into getting diagnosed for Endo if the periods are that bad and that painful.. I found out I had endo at age 30 by my doctor which is crazy cause I have had issues since I started my period at 9. 

Sadly I am in KS and only know KS and MO laws on all that but I hope that helps a bit.. most will just be calling and talking to people really.

Brecksvile has Testosterone on location and usually you can start the same day as your first appointment. I dont know why he was told Medicaid wouldn't cover hormones, both medicaid/medicare cover hrt, it may not cover all of it but it should cover the majority and you'd only be paying $70 out of pocket at the highest. The only thing usually not covered are needles and syringes. I hope this helps <3 Best of luck to y'all
A lot of people choose to get their name and gender marker on their ID changed together since it would be basically repeating the same process twice just to do them seprately. However, that would require someone to be several years on hrt before the legal courts will even consider changing his gender marker at all. Which means he may need to put up with several years of getting deadnamed by doctors and potential jobs before he can achieve a name change. Personally I am in the process of a legal name change without changing my gender marker, simply because there is no gender marker option available to nonbinary people in my state, so no matter what I do my gender marker will always misgender me. I believe the process is relatively similar to change both legal name and gender marker together, although I didnt look much into that side of things. 

You'll want to look up the specific rules in your state, but you'll generally start off with filing an application with your local court system. You'll be able to find the papers you need online for this. After applying, a lot of places require that a person changing their name to run an ad in an approved newspaper about the name change, usually for several weeks. Some states also require getting your fingerprints taken too. And then you show up to the appointed court date with all the proof you need to show that you jumped through all the hoops. Your nephew will have to stand before a judge and explain why he wants a name change and gender marker change. Hopefully its a nice judge and they will sign his request. If not they may reject his request and he'll have to start all over
OMG thank you for the PCOS info or at least the name of a drug that might help! (and the other info as well. 

I am running into trouble finding ANY gender therapist. My therapist (generalized anxiety/depression aka Covid broke me) is amazing and she's been working to find anyone who specializes in what my nephew needs and we are completely striking out!  (she says she needs to go back in time and change specialties as she never knew of the lack in her profession. She is shocked)

I need a trans-friendly GYN too as I've found that the doctors he was seeing are woefully inadequate for his care. He was on 13 prescriptions and 8 of them conflicted with each other (including \*3\* antidepressants.  

We are slowly getting tough with doctors and replacing/educating ourselves - I ""speak doctor"" and his so called support system prior to this had him going to a ton of different doctors - ALL prescribing meds and NOBODY talking to each other.  No wonder he was a mess!  

I'm going with him to different doctors, basically interviewing them and asking ""what can you do for him? "" ""Why does he take x med. Are you aware he was also prescribed Y med and they have contraindications? We have ""fired"" 2 doctors and are replacing at least one more. (he was seeing a Pediatric - and not particularly trans-friendly GYN)

As I have said  unfortunately the health insurance won't even speak to me - we are compiling a list of questions and are going to set up a 3 way phone call soon to attempt to force a conversation - a lot of things have changed very quickly in both our lives including finding out that his social security number was used by a parent to open accounts - what fun!

You all are helping so much though!
OMG this helps SO much!!!

My daughter lives in a western suburb of Cleveland and I am VERY familiar with Brecksville - this will be my  first call tomorrow!!

Thank you thank you!!
The Pride Centers can also help you with name change paper work!! Its a bit of a process, but they provide you the paper work and will assist you
Thank you. 

I was not sure if you could change gender marker without surgery. Or without Therapy. 

He has already been misgendered and deadnamed by doctors/everyone who deals with him professionally for 5 years.  He has been living 100% as male for that long.

I'm ready to help - but I can't afford to pay for either top surgery or Hormone therapy.  And since his insurance is through his mother - they won't talk to me and I'm not sure how to coach/assist him in speaking with them. He's introverted and he doesn't know the questions to ask - we are trying to set up a 3 way call and hope they'll speak to me if we're both on the line.
Again thank you thank you!!
As far as I know he wouldnt need all the surgeries in order to get his gender marker changed, likely just hormones.

Unfortunately I am not yet at a stage where I can even consider hormones because of money issues as well, so I dont really have much advice about getting it. But Ive heard there are a couple ways of going about it. You can find a gender therapist, someone who works specifically with trans patients in order to get a note approving the need for testosterone, which the insurance company should accept. This option will put him on a waiting list that can take months or sometimes years for him to finally get hrt (pointless barriers suck)

Or you can do the informed consent route. There are some care clinics like planned parenthood that offer informed consent for trans patients where basically they tell the person everything they need to know about what hrt does and does not do and then give the perscription right away. The flip side is that insurance often wont cover for the expenses using this method but its much faster.

Not that I really know about how to get hrt tho, haha. If anyone else sees thay Ive made a mistake in my understanding of how to get hrt, please let me know!
AT this point I think he is only interested in HRT and top surgery - but he's still young enough to be flexible with what he wants. And I don't care because it doesn't affect me (other than making him happier and more secure - which of course makes me happy)"	nl2qbo	trans	13	1.0	2021-05-25 23:16:06

It be mind blowing if this one was succesful,

Pretty sure guy was uncomfortable with me being trans, woman prob was fine with it.
4. They asked questions that were super uncommon for this type of job, I was caught by suprise and had to come up with answers while my brain refused to work (read brain farts)
5. When I ask how they get back to me, they said they didn't know, enough said :)
OOOOOOF on #5, but that can also be because they may not know. Depends on how much department shenanigans there are. Hiring might be totally separate from the department actually hiring, so they give the result to said department who then decide whether or not to contact. I can't imagine they would do this, but a lot of companies make like know sense in how they function.

Someone in r/ask invalidated my gender. CW: Dysphoria, really harmful comments.	It started off with the question: “why do people get so annoyed by gender reveal parties?” So I answered truthfully with the obvious “I hate stereotypes” reason, but I also mentioned “what if the baby grows up to realise it’s gender isn’t the same as their sex?”. That’s where the transphobia started. Another user mentioned sex and gender were the same thing, so I mentioned that no, they’e not. Sex and gender are different things. The same user asked “besides from male and female, what genders can babies be born as?” I mentioned intersex, the guy called it bs, then I mentioned I was genderfluid, and he kept invalidating trans people until I brought up “oh, so you’re transphobic, are you?” THIS GUY FULL ON SAID “on, so you’re one of those people with a mental illness, huh? Go get that checked out for me, will you?” I fucking hate him. Oh, and then he age shamed me for not being 21 yet! Fml!	"[deleted]
Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.
Even though gender and sex are technically different, you don’t want to distinguish them in front of people like that. 

That nuance is a slippery slope which can give transphobic policymakers leverage to legislate trans people out of existence.
If I'm honest I don't see what's the big deal either. I like gender reveal parties. 🤷 It's not a life sentence, it's just a one-day party that will have no impact in the child's life at all. Trans rights don't have to mean ""nothing has to be gendered at all ever"". Also, as an intersex person, that's wrong. Intersex people are still male or female, we're not a third sex.
Sorry you had that experience. It sucks to be talked down to. You have every right to not respond to those kinds of comments. People who go on the internet to say that gender and sex are the same thing have 0 interest in learning. They will take whatever information you give them and use it to attack you and other trans people. Block those people and ignore them. There's nothing you can do for them. I hope you have people that do support you. From one genderfluid person to another, you are 100% valid in your gender and there's nothing to fix.
Could have called him an ablest for harassing someone with a mental illness if using his logic against them.
I didn’t mention my age, he looked at my page, where I have photos of cosplay and some photos in r/enbyfashionadvice
I tried to explain nicely how they’re different, but he just wouldn’t accept it.
But everyone else I’ve talked to has called intersex a 3rd sex and now I’m confused.
It's not. Anyone who's intersex has been assigned male or female at birth. (we call it CAGAB, for Coercively assigned \[gender\] at birth). But majority of the time you can't even tell that the child is intersex. I just have an hormonal imbalance, it doesn't make me a third sex, just a different version of one."	uaofj7	trans	12	0.88	2022-04-24 06:24:18
No longer a Christian	"Short version: I used to be a Christian, but I'm no longer a Christian, because I believe one cannot (or at least should not) be a Christian and a supporter of trans rights.

&#x200B;

I used to be devoutly Catholic, to the point that I considered the priesthood.  Instead, I decided to become a woman.  But as recently as a year ago, I would have still considered myself Catholic.  I just thought, ""Well, I don't feel comfortable going to Mass anymore, but I'll just believe what I want to believe and ignore what I don't like.""  At some point, a trans Christian friend invited me to the Transgender Christian Facebook group.

&#x200B;

Then about a year ago, I was listening to a podcast called ""Girl-ish"" hosted by two trans women and they were discussing the negative impact that Christianity had on their lives.  I thought about other transgender friends who were treated horribly by their families or faith communities after coming out.  I began to realize I was, in a sense, part of an anti-trans hate group that was causing real suffering to those who aren't insulated like I am within a liberal southern California family.

&#x200B;

I spent a lot of time this past year exploring other spiritualities, like modern paganism Zen and Taoism among others.  But I was still pretty heavily invested in this Catholic identity I had.  

&#x200B;

The last straw came on January 6th, 2021, during the Capitol riot.  I realized that I cannot occupy the same spiritual space as Trump supporters and QAnon believers and evangelicals.  I was on one end of the spectrum, they were on the opposite, but we were still on that same spectrum.  I know that not all Christians are hypocrites and liars, but there is something in the DNA of Christianity which allows it to be used for violence and oppression.  The fusion of Trumpism and evangelicalism isn't some aberration, it's a natural progression.  Both are authoritarian movements founded on the belief that, ""I am right.  I am good.  Because I am right and good, everyone who disagrees with me is wrong and evil.""

&#x200B;

All this time, I was still a member of the Transgender Christian group on Facebook.  I didn't say much, because I didn't have much to say, but I read other people's posts.  They were quite sad.  Many of them suffering internal shame as well as external condemnation.  Others did theological acrobatics to explain why being trans wasn't a ""sin"".  It was simply an attempt to reconcile two fundamentally opposed viewpoints.

&#x200B;

I posted on the Facebook group, saying I was leaving, saying why.  I did it as gently as I could.  I did not attack anyone or any group.  I didn't leave right away, I wanted to see what kind of responses I would get.  Instead, I was kicked from the group before I could leave.  And that, to me, is Christianity in a nutshell."	"I'm sorry you've had those experiences.

And, I think you are spot on in regards to Evangelicalism and Trumpism.

My wife and I have left Christianity for similar reasons.

We were Lutheran, and I had actually attended a conservative Lutheran seminary for a few years. I had left the particular denomination (LCMS) several years ago after a professor gave me an ultimatum to leave or recant a defense I made of the LGBT community. We joined an ELCA congregation for a few years. 

I realized just a couple weeks ago that I no longer believe in God, and she no longer believes in a theistic God (she calls herself a Deist now). Part of the issue for me was realizing just how much I had used religious dogma and guilt to suppress myself. How much I had been *forcing* myself to believe in God to avoid dealing with my identity. 

Not all religious people are immoral or cruel --- and some are positively heroic ---, but religion is a convenient excuse for immorality and cruelty. And it becomes an excuse for people to live lives of lies and self-deceit.
Ex Catholic here also. Don’t regret it even in the slightest.
I'm no longer a christian either. I mean, I wasn't before, but I'm not now too!
You’re reasons make sense. I don’t blame any queer person for rejecting religion. I personally am a deeply devout Episcopal and see no issue reconciling that with my gender
I think its possible for trans people to exist and be accepted in Christianity, but not if they're worshipping the catholic God I was raised to live with.

I had a friend who told me the first time he met a trans person was a trans woman who was the priest at his Canadian United church. Which is absolutely wild to me. I think there is space for the identities to intersect, but not within ""mainstream"" Christianity or the nonsense I was raised in that taught me to hate myself.
The biggest win the Devil ever had was convincing the world that shame was a part of Christianity. God never asks us to be perfect, only to love Him and to love one another as we love ourselves. Becoming trans is our way to love ourselves and it gives us insight on how to properly love others. Because God is Love. 

The Bible has been translated a billion different ways and keeps having parts added in by man in order to further their own goals. The entire Old Testament is literally just a propaganda piece for Israel in order for their leaders to control their people. They added countless laws and punishments that hurt people and allowed hate to run rampant, so God sent Jesus to set their teachings straight. Jesus told us to not lean upon our own understanding and that his word would persist, meaning not the Bible as a whole, but His words. His parables. His teachings. Those persist even as the Bible is changed. Every one of the 10 commandments fall back on that concept of universal love.

He tells us not to judge as judgement brings unnecessary shame and self loathing that push people from love. He tells us that the path to hell is pathed with good intentions and those that try to “help” you aren’t doing it maliciously, but because their hearts are filled with shame too. They think that shame and guilt is love because they don’t love themselves and are repeating what they are taught. He tells us that good works don’t get you into heaven, only your heart. He tells us that the path to heaven is long and narrow, meaning that out of the third of the world that claims to be Christian, very few will enter the kingdom of heaven. Because the modern Bible, the modern church, has been twisted by hatred. You don’t need to be a Christian to get into heaven, you simply need to live a life of love. 

“I am the way, the truth, and the light, and no man may meet the Father but through me.” He is the one who is judging our hearts and is our ambassador. It doesn’t matter your religion as long as you love others and love yourself, you’re still following the way of Christ. That is why people before Christ could still go to heaven. We have known what love is since the beginning of man and so God gives no one an excuse for not practicing it.
Yeah I was even raised by the “cool” ones and still way too repressed, too many mental backflips and over explaining, everything feels healthier without religion.

I’ve said to myself because it is very scary letting go of that, if the world is wrong about who god is, he’s welcome to let me know, any time now. Lost sheep here. Change my mind. So far all I’ve found is myself

I’m Scared to Transition	I want to transition at some point in my life, but I’m scared to do so. I’m afraid that it may be too expensive, I’ll have a lot of health problems, and I’ll end up regretting it and be depressed for the rest of my life. Also, my parents are extremely religious and they might disown me. They’ve already punished me for wearing clothes of the opposite sex, and they tell me “You’re delusional. Satan is confusing you. You’re destroying our family. God made you a man, so live like one”. I just don’t know what to do. These thoughts have made me depressed, and sometimes I wish I was never born. Sometimes I think I really am delusional, and I bring my family shame. What should I do? Should I really transition when I move out, or try something else to eliminate my dysphoria?	"I think you will want to talk to a therapist who specializes is gender issues. If you can't go to one local there are options online. It will help to talk to a professional. There really isn't a way to cure the dysphoria. Transitioning is the best way to help, from what I've read. I am just starting my journey so I don't have any sage wisdom. My first therapy appointment is in a couple hours and I'm hopeful.
Yes, a gender therapist and transitioning is the path forward.  There are no other ways to deal with dysphoria long term.  I’m transitioning at 40.  I regret every year of repression, denial, and fear.

Your parents are trying to control you, but they are completely wrong.  If you’re trans and want to transition, your life will likely be miserable if you listen to what they say.
You don't have to do anything, just promise me you'll stick around. 

I'm asking myself the same questions, and also sometimes angry to be born to such a cruel mean world. Kate Bornstein has great advice for that. 

My mom is religious but she accepts that my queerness is something God gave me. 

If ""being born a man"" was all it took to ""be"" one, why would you have to ""act"" like one? 

And why would we have this propulsion/compulsion/impulsion or calling to act otherwise? Why wouldn't the design be clear as soon as we come out of the box? Clearly anatomy + performance is not a complete package, not as neat and uniform as folks wish.

I see this as a calling, and my parents are sometimes hard to talk to about it but they do get it. It is a cup I must drink from, as Jesus said in the garden when he prayed, knowing the Romans were closing in on him, and knowing that only through this struggle do we find salvation. 

If life were only for material wealth and happiness, it wouldn't have been designed this way. As Buddha said, in all like there is suffering and struggle. There must be something to be gained from that, worth more than money. 

Change your body, your life, your name, your clothes, your location, your job -- anything you want. But not for wealth, and not for happiness. 

Follow the compass that points to self-salvation, whatever that means for you. I think above all, above 'happy' and 'looking good', we want to be free. We want our minds free.
“God made me *this* way. It’s a challenge for me to face for whatever reason. Who said God made a mistake at all?”
Try socially transitioning in your group of friends first and see if that helps it. Being gendered correctly always makes my day :)
Sweetie, you cannot keep suppressing the inevitable because its going to come back everytime maybe even stronger. You have to do what makes you happy. Keep strong love!
 Its all going to workout

You don't have to be an angel to deserve support	"Especially when I was younger and pre-transition, I made a lot of bad decisions in my life. Hurt people deeply, made people uncomfortable, and spent a lot of time thinking about it over the years. A therapist once told me that I should seek out support groups for transgender people and I said, ""Those support groups are for the \*good\* trans people. Not for people like me. Not for the ones giving all trans people a bad name."" Often when my friends expressed support for my coming out and my progression in my transition, I internally wanted to scream, save your heart reacts for the good people, the ones who have been treated unfairly their whole lives, not for the aggressors and the perpetrators.

But the truth is, every single one of us makes mistakes, and we all look back with shame sometimes, and even if you feel like your mistakes are worse than others, it doesn't matter. What matters is the future. In the future you have the opportunity to live life as the person you want to be: a good person who makes the world a better place and feels happy in their own skin. A person who has learned who they are and what they want to be and how they want to act. And that support will help you get there. And it's okay to accept it. You don't have to pass a purity test or be an angel to receive support in your journey. Everyone deserves love. Including you.

I'm in a much better place today and proud of who I am and the positive healthy connections in my life. If anyone is having similar thoughts, please feel free to private message me. I can help talk you through this. Good luck."	"""Be patient with yourself. You are growing stronger every day. The weight of the world will become lighter...and you will begin to shine brighter.

How can I deal with the feeling of shame?	"Amab 22 here. I've never done this, but I guess I'll put a trigger warning here for some people who might have some issues with passing. First off, I'm not even sure yet if I'm trans, but lately I've really been questioning my gender (not for the first time ever, but it's been a while since the last) and have had some episodes of what I would interpret as gender dysphoria. I even told my girlfriend in the heat of the moment, so in a way there's no going back to how it was before.

Anyways, that's the introduction. Apart from all the other factors that would keep me from transitioning and from accepting that I'm trans (family that might not be thrilled, friends that I'm very unsure about, work...), there would be the fact that I just can't picture myself realistically as a woman without an intense feeling of shame. I'm not that feminine looking, have somewhat broad shoulders, and tall, with a somewhat square jaw, a prominent brow ridge and so on. You get the picture. I've been told I look like and angry German when my face isn't covered by hair (I've recently had to shave almost all my hair). 

So when I picture myself as a woman and I try to be honest with myself regarding what I would look, I only see a masculine looking person with long hair and feminine clothing. I know there's makeup and other parts to make you look more feminine (or what we associate with femininity), but it doesn't really help and the thought actually makes it worse, because I only see a man with lipstick. That in itself might be a sign in not really trans and just confused, or it might be insecurity. 

I mean, of course, hrt helps with the look, just like certain surgeries, but you have to be really sure about your identity to start considering those options (or at least I would have to be). 

So, I know every case is different, but has someone had a similar situation and what did you end up thinking was the best for you?"	"[deleted]
I don't really know how to respond to this, just that reading this actually brought a smile to my face (what a cheesy line, I know). Thanks so much for your kind words, I really felt them. I will try to have a more positive outlook and start slowly with things you mentioned, first of all growing my hair back again. You made my day!
P.S. also appreciate your comment about my body being able to pass, any encouragement helps at this point.

That's my mood lol but yeah, I believe (and hope) that it helps, and am glad that it helped you go through this. 

Also ugh, going to the therapist is probably going to be one of the biggest hurdle for me, but I guess I should get through that when I can. I'm completely introverted and often shut of from the world, it took me 3 days of laying in their arms and stammering to tell one person about this, so fuck."	k9q22k	trans	14	0.94	2020-12-09 11:12:29
"Why are politicians arguing that transgender bathrooms will ""scar children""?"	"Hello /r/trans, I've a question about the political climate and I was hoping this might be the right place to discuss.

In light of the NBA recently moving their All Star Game out of NC, a columnist had this to say:

""What is wrong with a person using a bathroom provided for the sex the (sic) were born with, if you want to change your gender so be it, we are a free county, but don't force 8 years old children to be exposed to having to share bathroom facilities with people that don't share the organs they were Bourne (sic) with, this is plain wrong, this could cause irreparable damages to a children's that don't understand why they have to see what God did not mean for them to witness, we have some very confused business as well as political humans that frankly have made this a political issue rather then (sic) moral issues, SHAME ON THEM."" (http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/17126387/one-charlotte-hornets-owners-blasts-nba-city-losing-all-star-game)

I don't understand why transgendered bathrooms might possibly ""cause irreparable damages"" to children.

My understanding is this. Humans are born with genitals. Humans use genitals to do their business and procreate. Some humans have the genitals they were born with, others do not. How is that going to scar children from understanding plain science? Do we distrust the intelligence and compassion in our children so much that we have to go through such political arguments just to shield them from something as simple as this? "	"It can't and doesn't. Republicans/Conservatives are just entirely wrong on literally every subject. See: Their denial of climate change, their rejection of evolution and acceptance of creationism, trickle-down economics, etc.
Seems like for a lot of Republicans (at least the politicians), life just isn't worth living unless you're oppressing SOMEONE - whether it's women, trans people, gay people, etc. To be honest, I think the Republican party is just big on scare tactics to get elected vs actual good ideas to improve society and our country as a whole.
The implicit reason they never want to come out and admit is that they find us disgusting, against nature, and revile us completely. They assume children will share that horrified reaction across the board.
It's standard ""think of the women/children"" bullshit.
Because they will say literally anything to instill fear.  Fear equals votes.
Leftover puritanical beliefs. Christians used to not even bathe themselves in the fear that seeing their own naked bodies would give them impure thoughts. That much crazy takes a long time to find its way out of the gene pool. 
Adults assume that kids have the same fears and inability to deal with anything new like they do. Kids, when you explain it in an age appropriate manner and keep it simple, are usually pretty agreeable. It's later on that they pick up their parents neurosis. 

    
If you meet someone like that IRL, just keep asking - but why would that hurt children? I'm sorry I don't understand why this would cause harm to children, could you please explain why?
It might help if you understand that to them, no one is born trans. Being trans is an acquired psychological dysfunction brought about by any number of environmental factors and traumatic events, most often but not always in early childhood. They view transness as something to be corrected when it occurs, not celebrated or normalized. To them, the body is immutable and the mind is fragile.

What I'm getting at is that when they say ""irreparable harm"" they mean the child might start asking questions about their own gender. Being trans is itself a symptom of the irreparable harm they fear. Acceptance of transgender people is a social plague to them and they wish to cure those they can, and hide those they can't in order to prevent any impressionable children from getting the idea that gender is anything but the genitals they were born with.

Don't ask them about Bugs Bunny...
>I don't understand why transgendered bathrooms might possibly ""cause irreparable damages"" to children.

Christians and radical feminists (who are sometimes the same individuals) love using children as a human shield. They do not mean what they say, they just want to shout ""But think of the children!"" so they can say that if you disagree with them, you hate children.
I don't think any parent is going to let their children ""look"" at other people in a private stall... that's absurd! Clearly a straw man argument by the radical right to sensationalize their position.
The best argument is that protections for us will also be abused by exhibitionists and voyeurs and rapists and other Bad People.  I can see some value in that, although ideally we'd be able to deal with Bad People in a more targeted way.  

There was [this case at U of Toronto](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/10/06/u-of-t-bathrooms-voyeurism_n_8253970.html) that is pretty much the definition of Why Rape Culture Means We Can't Have Nice Things.  

In any normal situation, though, if your kid is seeing other people's junk in the bathroom, you should teach them to not crawl into stalls.

not everything, just 99.9% of things. that and they think their view is the ONLY one that is valid. 
And they will if they are taught that way. There are people out there drilling hate into their children daily.
I'm not sure where you've gotten this idea they don't want to come out and say it. I've heard it from the lonliest GOP voter all the way up to candidates, presidents, and congressmen.
To build upon this: I believe that the people in power - regardless of party affiliation, mind you - need to find a way to justify their continuous reign above the masses. More and more people are asking as a result of this election whether it is really worth it to tolerate the government that's in place. All you need in order to reign some of those people back is to point out a scapegoat.

""B-but, look over there! You're going to use the bathroom with someone like that! Think of the danger! Good thing we're here to maintain the status quo. Where would you be without us to help?""

Transgender people deviate from the norm that has been so nicely established by the elite, so naturally you can use them as both a dartboard and a convenient voting base to appeal to if you're a liberal running for office! It's so convenient that way. (Ugh.)
Even when you hit them in the face with science.
Oh I know, but they're of the belief that their reaction is natural, not taught. I also think they conflate ignorance, or a lack of intuitive comprehension, of people like us with the notion that we shouldn't exist in public.
I rarely hear them come out and say it. Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places, but it's far more common to hear suggestions that there are perverts among us, it's fine to do at home in our private time, and things of that ilk, than a straight up confession that we disgust them and they hate us.
i was debating a friend on trans issues prior to coming out to him, i gave him links to actual medical research on transgender people and his response was ""that doesnt mean anything"" but yeah, jesus totally is inside him when he listens to christian rock when he is sad. although he is completely okay with me being trans despite his beliefs which counts for something, i thought i was gonna lose him as a friend when i started my transition
I like to tell Christians, 

""Belief in god should be about celebrating the wonder of the gift that is creation.  You might think you honor god by adhering to religious dogma, but don't you dare tell me that trying to understand the incredible gift of creation, and self awareness through questions and science is heresy, because that's how I honor my God, appreciation through the humility of wonder."""	4u689e	trans	13	0.76	2016-07-23 02:03:07
Transition Helped Me Love.	"AMAB: Prior to transition I was interested in men but could never fully express myself emotionally or physically. I felt such shame around it and was uncomfortable being vulnerable. I was unable to love how I knew I was meant to.

Transition has allowed me to express my love and affection how my soul wants to, without fear or shame. When I run my fingers over my boyfriend's chest he feels a woman's touch. When I wrap my arms around his neck and kiss him I do it with grace and confidence. When I look him in the eyes I have a female gaze.

What an amazing gift this has been. I lived in the wrong body for 43 years, but the last year and a half feels like the first time I have been truly alive.

Here's to all of us learning to live and love authentically!!! 🫶"	"This is really beautifully written and I'm so happy for you! Love this!

I learned two things today at age 33.	"°1- I'm classy as fuck. Explanation comes with bullet 2.

°2- It's a lot more fun, and definitely less shameful, more fulfilling, and wholesome to jerk someone else off instead of yourself. Even at 3am behind a gas station.

I lived for 32 years as a ""cisgender heterosexual male"". I knew what I should be since as long as I can remember fear of social backlash kept me from investigating dating another male and never meeting a mtf trans girl didn't bring the opportunity. Oddly girls were never into me but I was constantly swatting gaybois away from my door with a broom. I always dreamed about what it would be like.

Well I live in my car, but I have my cell and laptop. Never been on grindr decided to try it. Apparently I'm desirable now, bizarre.  So I met up with a guy not realizing we couldn't go back to his place so we agreed on just treating it like we were a highschool boy and girl. Were both in our 30's. I found this nice little paved nook behind a gas station with a clean surface and dimly lit with no one around so I sat, he sat, we chatted a bit, and then I snuggled Into him and immediately I could tell a difference on estrogen.  Then he put his hand on my thigh oh my. 

Anyway sparing details that was my first encounter with a boy and I kinda thought it was ironic that our ""highschool kids"" date ended up taking place right when my body is adjusting to estrogen and we ended up foolin around in a parking lot but not having sex. I never thought at this age id be able to have an encounter like that."		ji0ipe	trans	12	0.88	2020-10-25 20:29:19
Parents already know I’m non-binary, but I haven’t told them about my chosen name; problem is, my dead name’s the same as my mom’s, how do I tell them?	"Warning; Long post…

Hey guys! For context, I am a Non-Binary (AFAB) 20 year old, who came out as such two years ago. I am also Mexican, which will be a little bit relevant?

Since then, I’ve had a very uuh, stressful journey regarding my parent’s acceptance, though we are in a better spot today. After two years of practically BEGGING, they are willing to help with my top surgery for example, and my dad will call me other pronouns. My mom however, sticks to she/her exclusively, and has even told me straight up she believes I am a special kind of woman and its a shame for the world that I won’t allow myself to be. She said this with a kind(?) smile on her face, but it still really hurt a lot.

Now, for a very long time, I had been wanting to change my given name, which is VERY female sounding; though I never told my parents of this. And last April, I finally did it, and now most people refer to me that way, including some of my siblings. 

My dad did bring it up in passing as something I might want to do someday, but my mom has never. And to add another problem on top of that, I share my mother’s first name. So I am afraid she may be offended, or feel hurt that I no longer want to share names with her.

To make my parents feel included in the transition/naming process (I saw another trans person do this and I thought it was cute) I was thinking of letting them choose my middle name. For context, in Mexico we have a total of four names, first, middle/second, and our two parent’s surnames, with that father’s being the third and the mom’s the fourth. 

I do actually like my surnames! So I’m planning on keeping those, but even though I don’t mind my middle name THAT much… I don’t know, its still a little bit too feminine for me. So I was thinking of having them choose the middle name. 

However, lets add ANOTHER problem to the mix. My mom’s very religious, and three of my siblings are all named after very prominent saints (for context, I am the oldest of five), and well… I have religious trauma thanks to my mom :), so I am very afraid she will want to give me a saint’s name, and I will be yet again stuck with a name I’m uncomfortable with. I was thinking of just telling them “no names of religious figures” as a condition, but I am ALREADY telling them I am changing my name. Would that be too much?…

Straight up, I was also considering just changing my name myself. I do have a pretty cool middle name that I could use, and stole from a friend haha. It is related to Angels (none of you are going to guess it, even if you think you can), but as its not a specific saint name I don’t really mind. Biblical/horror angels are very cool after that!

So, yeah… This was a long and detailed post, but I wanted to give us much context as possible. Do you have any tips on what I could do? And, do you think even letting them choose my middle name is a good idea?… I don’t know, I am afraid of making them feel too left out, even if it is my own life and all that. 

Even if you don’t comment, thanks for reading all the way though! I appreciate it

PS; Thought I might add, as a Mexican (lol), yes, I have like a thousand family members. I am not out to most of them yet, but my chosen (first) name is unisex so if they ask I won’t necessarily have to come out. If they do, I’ll just say it felt more true to who have I become and that I wanted to have a new beginning or something. I got that covered already I think."	"Did somebody comment? I swear I got a comment notification but for the life of me I can’t find said comment, even if there is a “1” on the comment part
Get more information first? Without giving anything away, sometimes people will ask the pertinent party questions to flesh out where they are and what they're thinking. But it takes self control to not give your own input and just listen. *(not saying you don't have control, but just in general it's hard when we are engaged and feel something earnestly)*

Then... with more info, maybe it'll narrow it down a bit? Maybe there could be a long lost trans relative that comes up that has a badass name that also happens to be spiritually significant.."	x2ynsh	trans	12	1.0	2022-09-01 04:54:06
Should be proud, I have a job with health benefits, but I need to vent instead...	"I finally got a copy of the Summary Plan Description (I'd bet most people don't read these things) and I have this to say:

*Fuck* the transphobia of my progressive, gay-friendly employer.

Their policy extends spousal benefits to domestic partners without discriminating on sex.  There is a clear standard for who is eligible (both legally single, common welfare, shared residence), and while I can see cases of inequality (what if your domestic partner is on military deployment?) I get the sense that someone somewhere tried to do the right thing.

But, this, this exclusion is shitty:

> 25 [expenses for] therapy, supplies, or counseling for sexual dysfunction or inadequacies that do not have a physiological or organic basis.

> 26 [... (next paragraph) ] drugs or supplies used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, impotence, or sexual dysfunction or inadequacy [...]

> 27 [expenses] for or related to sex change surgery or to any treatment for gender identity disorders.

> 28 Those for or related to artificial insemination, in vitro fertilization [...]


Because clearly changing sex is one of those want-not-need things like fertility or sexual adequacy.  Next up they exclude non-medical counselling (financial, career, pastoral...), acupuncture, speech, and cosmetic treatments.

(But wait!  Bottom surgery for your intersex infant is covered.)

Fucky fuckity fuck this nonsense!  Especially since the plan is administered by Aetna, known for being not-too-terrible to trans people.

And especially after my parents taking me out of therapy because they didn't like what they were hearing.

Just venting, not ready to shame my employer (since I haven't given them enough chance to *fix it dammit*) but it's a well-loved American brand.

Feel like I might have to find trans-friendly legal help.  Gonna start with with the personnel department though.

---

UPDATE (good things!)

I missed the chance to call Personnel after work (graveyards) - was very much going to but had half a pizza and one drink and decided sleep was the right choice.  It was avoidance behavior but still the right choice: I feel *really* good with a day's sleep behind me.

Tomorrow I'm going to reenroll myself in the outpatient counselling program I had been in.  New location, new person (prolly will see someone for intake and someone else for treatment but I know the routine).  This time I'm going to make gender dysphoria my primary complaint and HRT referral a goal from the beginning.

Like, legit, I wanted to work on anxiety before (this place is not IC, but neither is it gatekeepy) now I'm pretty confident where that anxiety is coming from.

Insurance or no (they're in-network) I can afford this much and it'll be good to get the ball rolling again.

As I comment below, it looks like Aetna's policies for coverage are new and it might just be that my plan is older and slated to be updated.  If so, I should just need to bend the right ears (transphobia is not in line with corporate policies nor the actual culture) to get this change expedited for myself."	"I heard it's not too expensive to add on trans coverage.  Some university health plan I read about was looking into it and it didn't cost very much to add it.  So you might want to start with HR, especially if they're trying to be LGBT friendly.  They might not even be aware the exclusion is there.
I think you mean ""Bottom mutilation for your Intersex infant.""
This is what healthcare in America is.  Insurance companies will deny any thing they can, because not providing care is cheaper than providing it.  

Only in America are people allowed to make a profit off the suffering of others.  

Fuck yeah!
God that sucks. I in a similar boat with my insurance. It has a special exclusion for trans care. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois. Ugh. 
Yea, but for HRT most of that won't be covered because generics are cheap, and your GP/Endo can usually just bill the insurance under generic codes and hide your shit.

Gives you time to get started and look for an alternative.
AMEN.
>  Insurance companies

Aetna, though.  They exclude FFS and BA and cover pretty much everything else (including SRS).  This is specific to my employer.


So, your employer has sagely reviewed the statistics and found that it is cost effective to cover trans* care and has required its insurer to cover that care in their master policy.  

I promise you that Aetna left to their own devices does not cover trans care.  Because no one is forcing them to, and they still make money by not paying for care.  
Look closer though. They don't exclude srs but clitoral hood construction is cosmetic. What even is the reasoning behind that?
> Aetna left to their own devices does not cover trans care

That's what I've heard though... 

Do you have personal experience?

You know, now that I look at this again, I see srs coverage is fairly recent and (pardon my corporate language) Being Rolled Out.

Trans Healthcare in Finland, a TL;DR	"Here in finland, HRT is almost free and the government partially pays for a lot of different treatments.

**Difficulties:**

Unfortunately, it takes on average 1-1.5 years to get diagnosed because the two hospital units that deal with trans and nb people's issues (yes, I know) are criminally understaffed, and for some reason there are no private pathways for trans healthcare as far as I know.


NOTE: It is also possible that such treatments are just ungoogleable and you would have to get hormone treatment for some imaginary unrelated illness from a doctor who is willing to risk their medical license.

The aforementioned understaffing is probably due to the increasing  amount of people realizing themselves, while the number of trans-specializing doctors stays roughly the same as the only way to get a job in the sector is to work for public healthcare. 

**Other things (CW: transphobia):**

From 2016 to 2020, by the request of the person previously in charge of the Tampere City Unit (TAYS Trans-poliklinikka), care was without warning entirely cut for nonbinary people due to ""insufficient evidence to show that it is beneficial"". The same person has apparently said about transmasculine people ""it is a shame when beauty is thrown away"". Also transness is considered a mental disorder in the ICD-10 dicease classification standard, which will be used until sometime next year. The current standards also don't allow for non-binary people to get any corrective surgical treatment. This means that many transfeminine/transmasculine non-binary people have to lie. The distinction will probably be dispelled when ICD-11 starts being used (next year, as mentioned).

TL;DR (even shorter): Some care is very affordable, but getting diagnosed takes a long time and the system hasn't yet caught up with how gender is viewed nowadays."	"Most sources I used are my memory of reading a bunch of different articles from trans-positive non-profits and patient blogs and I've read through the official sources as well. For any further questions, ask me. I just listed a bunch of things that I found interesting.
That’s awful
Well, with all the flaws, at the very least it's not inexistent. Ideally tho everyone everywhere would have as easy access anywhere. But alas, we don't live in an ideal world.
yup I've been trying to get diagnosed for 1,5 years now and I still dont know when my next appointment is.

I have an ftm friend whos been trying to get diagnosed for even longer than me and the clinic told him that they dont want to give a diagnosis just because hes had depression in the past...

pretty fucked up system

edit: also one of the caregivers deadnamed me EVERY TIME even though I told her my name but nope she never remembered it and used the wrong pronouns and was just overall very very passive aggressive.
The longest distance you would have to travel for care is probably from the most northern village in Finland, Utsjoki to TAYS. It is a total of 1141 km, or 709 miles, and would take about 14 hours by car or 5h + 12h by car and then train. I don't know if flying and/or getting a taxi would be free for the patient."	py4v1l	trans	10	0.92	2021-09-29 21:13:55
Being trans.	"For years, I hated being perceived as a woman. A girl, female, a ""princess"", as some people called me. I finally grew up a little and I realized I am a man. And I don't know if this is the right flair, but I'm so excited to be the man I want to be. Even if I wasn't raised as one, even if some people will still stick to how I was born, even if I have to abandon some of my family, I'll always be a man. Wether they like it or not, wether I like it or not. I am a man. 
Though I wish time went faster to see myself being actually happy, I'll keep having this journey. I wish I had born as I wanted, to have my organs, proper name, etc. I know it works differently for everyone. To me, I wasn't born in the right body. But I'm going to pursue it. 
I'll have my beard, I'll have my own voice, I want to have my kids and have my partner. I don't know how to express it, but I really want it. I just want to say it. 
Even if I still hate to death the idea of not being born as I wanted to for all the tears and suffering I'll have to go through, one day I'll stop crying, and I want to say I will. 
It's my dream.
I am socially transitioning right now, and I can say I'll make it through. This is one of the biggest steps I have to do in order to be who I want, and I'll do it. I know I have hope, I don't care if it doesn't like to people, I am a man. I am proud of being a man, I love being who I am and I am proud of myself for making it this far, even if it's not that much.
If you're reading this feeling hopeless or too scared, please, never feel shame of yourself. You are yourself, your Identity is absolutely valid and you are beautiful for it. I am still young, so I'll keep living for my happiness. I hope everyone can live for theirs and more too."	"Congratulations, Sir! Stay positive!!! Every one of the success stories is an inspiration!

im not ashamed of being trans anymore!	"its 2:34 in the morning and i am awake still because ii have to put what im feeling to words right now,

i am trans  i am a woman , and for the longest time i felt soo ashamed , i hated my life , i had hoped i would have died countless times because i could not bear the shame of being trans , i was depressed for such a long time. existance up till now was either living in denial and or drowning in my fears and thoughts  which lead me into depression , i was so afraid and i still am, life was so pointless i saw no future for myself i had hoped that by signing up to the army i would  get rid of my transness or  hoped that i die on the line of duty so i dont have to deal with my trans identity and nearly succeded with that

but im here today! i am alive, i must move forward no matter what, i am trans and i no longer feel ashamed and i realise my feelings of shame  stemed from my fear of being abandoned by family and ending up alone so i shamed this part of me  and tried to cast it away this compassionate , loving human side of me i had mistreated for so long and all that was left of me was an empty husk a robotic shell that goes through the motion without care nor love  or emotions because inviting that in would have meant that i would have shown through and the safty shell will no longer exist, i am reliefed to say i feel like i finally cracked through, i dont feel ashamed of being trans anymore , i dont know if this is considered pride and i dont know what being proud feels like but what i do know for a fact is that im not ashamed !, being trans is such a simple thing to understand  even kids understand it , yet grown human beings choose not  to understand us because we do not quit fit in their preception of reality  which requirs them to grow out of that comfort zone but people are afraid of change... it is a lot easier to reject and push away that which we dont understand , specially if  the person in question is relgious ,it kind of baffels my mind how people seem to forget that we are also people! ,

i for the longest time have cried myself to sleep greifing over  how my family will react  and the posibility of them throwing me away, i was so very afraid of comming out and i still am but way less because now i realise theres no point in crying over spilled milk i am trans and that much i know its not going to change  i realise that if i come out today tomorrow or next year isnt going to change the respose i will get  if my family truelly loves me they will try to understand me and help me  but if they dont then they dont i cant control how people think or view me i probobly would be devistated  but i know that its okay if my family does not want me to be happy ill have to reach out for happiness myself  

i do need family by my side but if my blood family chooses not to, yeah ill be soo sad but ultimately a family doesnt have to be blood related ! i will try to find my own family  , in this short lived life i have spent 24  years living a lie for the sake of my blood family that i robbed myself of happiness just to do what is expected of me  , i would love to have a daugther family relationship with the brothers with my mother  whom ive seen go through a lot , with my little brother who i watched grow from just a little baby  and my second youngest brother who our relationship doesnt even exist now because of having such a rough childhood to a father who was almost always absent for the first 17 years of my life, i want to love them as i am because wearing that fake shell of masculinity has robbed me of love for myself so how could i have loved others while i dwelled in self hate and pitty  i want to laugh smile share beautifull memeories but if i get rejected then thats okay too  i am my own person i wish them the best  but for me to be happy this is the path i must take to wherever it may lead me ,

 i now made peace with these emotions , now i need my big girl pants on because the road is about to get way tougher and  im okay with that  i have to come out asap and staart living authentically as maya ! because each second that flies by does not come back we all deserve to be happy  , and to be loved  and im  no different  i love every one of this community yall deserve the world  :)"		l911wh	trans	12	0.93	2021-01-31 01:23:24
I'm up way too early thinking about deleting my progress photos	"I have a small collection of progress photos that I've taken for myself over the 1.5 years I've been on HRT. I woke up at 4:30 and I may not be thinking clearly, but I've been going through them for the past hour and I don't see much point in keeping them. I'm never going to pass anyways, and if I did, why would I want to reflect on that? I don't share them with anyone because of the shame I feel around them and I feel shame and embarrassed looking at them. 

Am I being too reductive in my sleep deprived state?"	"1.5 years is a very short time. Transition is a marathon not a sprint.  

I vote go get some sleep and don‘t ponder about them until you’re further into your transition. Your view will probably change in the next 2, 5 and 9 years.  

(10 years is the number I was given for all changes to be „complete“ and to settle into them comfortably)
Girl, I looked at your photos and you're absolutely gorgeous. ""Passing"" can be important for safety but we don't have to let it define our own perception of our beauty. People who push the narrative of being cis passing as some inherent ultimate goal of transition are lying to you on behalf of the oppressive transphobic structures we live under.

You're incredibly pretty. If I saw you out in the world I would spend the rest of the day thinking about how cute you are and how much I wish I'd stopped to say hi.

I think I’m trans but I’m so scared I’m wrong	I (afab) have struggled with my gender since I was 4. It wasn’t super bad but it got worse as I became a teen. I am about to go to college and I’ve been really been questioning if I am trans ftm. My parents know I struggle and they would support me but they think it’s a phase. It’s really making me question everything because I already care so much what other people think. I think I’m in a stage of denial where I am dressing like a guy but not officially come out to myself. I’ve been itching to go on low dose T for a while but that’s a big decision and I just don’t want to be wrong. I haven’t changed my name or pronouns yet but I have a name picked out and I do like being addressed as a guy. I just don’t want to disappoint my parents but I feel shame about this when I’m around them. What if I am wrong and they’re right that is a phase?	"You know who never thinks they’re trans? Cis
If it was a phase, why have you been questioning it since you were 4?
i think you should go see a psychiatrist. They can help you make sense of everything and see if it isn't caused by anything else
>What if I am wrong and they’re right that is a phase?

Okay. Let's say it actually is a phase. What happens is.. you wear masculine clothing and go by masc pronouns and you try low dose T, and you find that you don't like those things as much as you thought, so you stop the T and get new clothes and use different pronouns.

Especially with low dose testosterone, I don't think you're going to alter your body in a permanent way. And you have a better understanding of what feels right for you.
Sadly the same here in the questioning part but my fam is odd and already joke that im the boi or w/e at times. And that my outfit makes me looklike 1 or unisex
You're not the only one. 

Most of the time, I'm sure I'm trans, but sometimes (during the monthly blood sacrifice) I think I'd be happier growing old as a woman. I see my body and wonder what's so bad about it. But then, a few days later, I start to feel awkward in my own body again, and I once again reach for my masc things. It's a cycle, for the moment.

You seem to put a lot of stock into what other people think. Why don't your thoughts matter just as much as theirs? It's not their body, it's not their mind. You are your own person, and you deserve to be yourself. 

It's scary, contemplating changing so much. But as someone not much older than you who's faced the prospect of life-altering medications and surgeries too many times to count, sometimes it's worth it to take the leap. You might find it makes you happier than you ever thought you could be... and that's what matters. Other people's opinions are their own, and yours counts too.

It's not the end of the world if anything turns out to be the wrong choice, especially early on. What happens if you get a binder or packer and find out you don't like them? You're out a few bucks. And if you find you hate T? You have to call and tell the doctor that, you're out a few bucks, and maybe some time, but that's fine. Now you know. People might be confused if you switch names and pronouns, but in my experience, they're gonna be confused anyway. That's their problem, not yours. You're allowed to experiment, you're allowed to find what does and doesn't work. You'll end up finding you in the process. And that's the best part.
Honestly true. It sounds kinda dumb when I say it like that haha. The thing is I don’t fit the stereotypical “trans narrative.” I’ve always had these thought they were just in the back burner in my mind. It wasn’t super obvious that I was uncomfortable in my gender, in fact I just thought it was internalized misogyny. The reason I’m still questioning is because I’m so unsure of myself as a person. I’m very cautious and that’s why I’m so scared to make such a huge change. Sometimes I’m afraid I’m making it all up. I know I’m not but I still doubt myself so much.
And that’s why you need to have a chat with a gender therapist, not some random on reddit who only has experienced their own journey. I genuinely hope the absolute best outcome for you my dude.
Yeah you’re right. I have an appointment booked but it’s in a couple months I’m just impatient lmao.

Supporting friend who confided in me	"One of my best friends refently told me they’ve started transitioning. It’s especially amazing as we’d grown apart the past few years but they randomly reached out and when we hung out on they told me about always feeling something had been off and then finally coming to terms with the reason behind this, being that they’re trans. They’re taking estrogen and in early stages so still trying to figure out what their journey looks like but I’m SO happy and excited for them. They’re still dealing with a lot of shame and confusion and I’d like to do whatever I can to support them. 

My question for trans peoples: what’s the best thing someone did for you upon learning you were trans? What kind of support do you wish you’d had? I’m so so proud of them and of course I’ll be there for them to talk or whatever they need but I just want to make it so clear how proud and happy I am for them.

That said, your friend will probably be understanding of any slip ups. This is a big change for them, and you. So if you do accidentally slip up, try not to be hard on yourself. Your friend will see that you’re really trying and most likely, I hope, know that there was nothing intentional behind the misuse. 
Keep being a great and supportive friend. 💜
Be there for them.  We lose a lot when we come out in transition.  Some lose more than others.  Few of us make it through transition with everyone and everything we started with.  It can be really painful and knowing they have even one pre-transition friend that will be there for them can make a world of difference. 💜
Being misgendered is a trigger for most people, so please make sure you get their name and pronouns right every time, paying special attention for when in public.
Trans people are people nobody is perfect. Just bc they make mistakes its not bc they’re trans. Please just love them for who they are and call them by their name. I don’t know the kind of relationship you have with them, but your not gonna understand them more then likely. Thats ok. As long as u don’t push them away. Trust me they’ll get plenty of that everywhere else.
Names & pronouns are a great start! If they confided in you & they're not out publicly, make sure to ask them who knows! You absolutely do not want to out them to anyone, accidentally or intentionally, because either your friend was meaning to tell them personally, or they're not sure if that person is supportive
Mostly I just wish I had learned I was trans sooner :/
Be willing to listen, especially if they have felt comfortable enough to confide in you at this stage, going so far as to reaching out to you after a while of separation, goes to show they really remembered you as someone to trust even despite the time apart. Don’t make them regret that! It doesn’t seem like you will based on your being here, but I just wanted to double check lol. But they may want to use you as a sounding board due to said trust, so listen give kind and considerate feedback, but don’t echo chamber them, ask genuine questions when appropriate and don’t ask inappropriate questions unless they volunteer that info first, don’t take liberties in their trust, ask what they are comfortable divulging first before you go into twenty questions, or just don’t barrage them lol, baby steps. But most of all just be there for them acknowledge what they are going through and give them your support during this turbulent time.
Essentially stay a good friend.
Follow-up question - they've only told 3 people total (also, therapist) and are still very uncertain about their journey/how they're going to want to present etc though they're very certain pronouns will be changing. They're taking it slow as it's a lot to handle (especially as their partner is actively unsupportive and borderline abusive but that's a different story) but assuming since it's still a secret/not something they're comfortable telling almost anyone still, I should stick to current/historical pronouns? Once again this hangout was our first in roughly 3-4 years and I'd imagine future ones would stay 1:1 but if we're around mutual friends I'd use their historic/known by everyone pronoun surely and then maybe preferred current/future one directly to them? I know I'll fuck up sometimes in the beginning but I want to be as supportive and outwardly happy for them as I can be.
Hoping my post didn't indicate our' growing apart was somehow on them due to being trans? If so, def not my intention. And def aware I won't understand so not going to try to insert any experience I've had as being remotely similar though that's a habit I have when trying to empathize w/someone. I have pretty severe ADHD and it took everything in my being to sit still and listen without any interruptions which is something I'm trying to stop in general bc it comes off as rude and interruptive but it's just a bad ADHD habit where I'm just trying to help them finish a story/sentence. But during this discussion I resisted! Overall just thrilled for them and can't wait to see them become more and more who they are.
I’m still very early on the process myself. It wasn’t until yesterday that I told my support worker. The best thing would be to ask how your friend would like you to refer to them. It may be that as far as pronouns go, neutral ones such as they/them might work. It all depends on what your friend is comfortable with."	ykzxhz	trans	11	1.0	2022-11-03 11:25:04
I Accidentally Outed my Partner and I Don’t Know What to Feel or Do	"This morning, I made the most detrimental mistake of my life. 

Me and my partner have known each other since August and recently started dating this December. Very few members of his family are aware of the fact that he’s FTM, and only one person living in his household knows. I was over at their house for a sleepover and was planning on hanging out with him today, but when I woke up this morning, he told me he wasn’t feeling very well and that he wanted to stay back home. His mom came into his room to ask us when we planned on leaving, and I made the mistake of referring to them with he/him pronouns instead of she/her pronouns after saying that HE wasn’t feeling good and that HE wanted to stay back home. Twice. Like an absolute fucking fool. He had mentioned to me multiple times that she was not accepting of the fact that he was trans and requested I use she/her pronouns at all times around her. I’d been good up until today, and the moment those words came out of my mouth, his mother immediately looked unhappy. She said she wanted to have a talk with him downstairs, and then the realization hit me like a freight train. 

Twenty minutes later, he came back upstairs. I’d been praying, hoping that they were talking about something else, but he just looked at me and said “I had to come out.” I didn’t even know what to think or feel, I was just in disbelief for the first few minutes but I started crying and apologizing over and over again after I faced the reality. He forgave me and told me it wasn’t my fault, but I could and still can barely find the words for the shame and self-loathing I feel right now.

Please, can anyone help me out with the steps I should take after this, of what I can say to make him feel better? My partner is truly one of the sweetest, most genuine people I know, and I put him into an incredibly tough position with his mother who will likely tell other family members. I feel so incredibly numb and helpless, and I so badly want to fix this. I keep thinking about how uncomfortable and tense he must be right now and it makes me want to throw up. I know this is my fault but please, I need advice from someone."	"Move on. You've made the point that you're sorry, just move on, and don't do it again. Nothing worse than someone continuing to bring up something that makes you feel bad.
Transphobia put the both of you to a very hard place. No way you could've kept that going for long. It's not healthy in the closet. He knows you are sorry. Stop concentrating on how you feel and start supporting your partner. Grocery shop, make food, clean, just take the burden off of him, hugs, kisses and just be there listening and supporting. You'll get through this and in a couple years you'll have a different point of view to all of this. Much love from here 💖
Honest mistakes happen. You're going to feel like shit for it, that's natural.

The most important thing is to be there emotionally for your partner.

Dont be too hard on yourself.
From personal experience, by continuing to fuss about it, it makes him feel like you’re making it about you the more you apologize. 

DH often tells me “it doesn’t matter what you MEANT, it matters how your words made ME FEEL. Stop making it about you!” I accidentally trigger him way more than I’m happy with. What I want from him is how to express what I mean in a way that isn’t triggering when I explain that I didn’t mean it that way. That’s not fair to him to be put on the spot like that. 

Good for you for looking for advice here!
That’s true, I won’t bring it up again. Thank you
Thank you, that gives me a lot better insight. I’m thinking it over and he texted me and said he talked more with his parents, so we’re both doing a little better now"	106nk3f	trans	9	0.92	2023-01-08 16:38:52
My family commenting on my body triggers dysphoria.	"(16yo transmasc) Last year helped me to discover myself and my identity, something that I'm really proud. A few months ago I came out to almost all of my closest friends and everyone respect my pronouns and my name, something that of course makes me really happy. But I haven't told my family yet and I'm sure I won't until I'm 18 at least, because they will probably say that I'm just confused or maybe they won't even believe me (when I was a kid I didn't show any signals of being trans, and for special occasions I still I wear femenine clothes).

The reason I wanted to do a post it's because lately my dad (very trans/homophobic) compliments my body as a very ""stylized female body"", he insists that I look very girly and that I'm becoming a woman (I actually don't understand it because I dress very masculine always). I HATE THIS SO MUCH. I used to feel lucky because I think I don't have a very femenine body (I have small chest and a not small waist) and with winter clothes I can pass easily. But since my dad is making these kind of comments it's starting to make me feel more dysphoric than ever, because it also makes me think that if I tell my parents how I feel and that I want to start T and have top surgery, they will say that it's a shame to waste a body like mine or something like that.

I know that at least they try to compliment me but I have always hated specific comments (good or bad ones) about my body, maybe because I've never been comfortable with it, but I don't know I'm just very overwhelmed because of this, more family stuff, a lot of anxiety today and everything"	"If your dad’s transphobic there’s a chance he’s already guessed you’re trans and is giving you ‘feminine’ compliments to try and change your mind
All I want to say is you don't have to come out if the closet to tell your family that what they are saying is upsetting instead of I know I'm a bit please stop try hey can I please dress how I want to"	rwsr8u	trans	10	0.92	2022-01-05 17:56:30
An Open Letter To God From A Trans Girl	"I guess it's time to write this.

&#x200B;

I don't want to. It takes courage, courage that I know I have, to reveal myself to you. To openly welcome being othered, openly welcome the ridicule, harassment, and humiliation that will come from it, but I don't have any real options left, not if I'm going to continue living. I wanted to die. My plan was to poison myself with a lethal dose of caffeine, carbohydrates, and sugar. I opened a door back in 2014, after I had left my ex-wife. I didn't really want to leave her; the sex, while sporadic, was good, she was beautiful, funny, and wanted nothing more than to be with me. We had a successful business together, and had a lot of really good times. What we didn't have was good chemistry. She had been abandoned by her father, and never really got over it. I was fresh out of the Army and riddled with PTSD, depression, and anxiety that I learned to contain and shove deep down inside because her OCPD, OCD, and anxiety were too much for her to handle. But, this isn't about her.

&#x200B;

I'm male (I have a penis and testicles), caucasian (my skin is white), and I'm primarily attracted to female and feminine presenting individuals. I grew up in a lower-middle class family, with a diverse amount of low- to upper-middle-class friends. I was the golden child of the family, the youngest on my father's side (except for my brother, who is seven years younger), and the oldest on my mother's. I tested well and was placed in gifted and talented programs in school. My IQ is somewhere in the 135-150 range. I've not had it specifically tested, but my ASVAB and vocational aptitude batteries put me in the top 1-3% of the population.

&#x200B;

The first memories I have are of me around the age of two or three, maybe four, at the latest, grinding my penis against a stuffed animal because it felt good. I remember being scolded for doing that during naptime at church daycare. There's large portions of my childhood and adolescence that I don't remember, but what I do remember is being bullied and teased. I remember the only defense I had against my bullies in the fourth grade was to make fun of them for not being able to read as well as I could. That behavior continued until I was in my pre-teens, when I learned about how masturbation was bad, and that I was bad for masturbating and having 'lustful thoughts.' Often, my fantasies would involve becoming something else, some sort of transformation into an animal. I didn't find the act of sex arousing, but the idea of the physical transformation, was. I haven't ever wanted to be the ""me"" that everyone else sees.

&#x200B;

We got America Online when I was about 12, in 1997. The internet wasn't ""new"" to me, then, though the connectivity to other people was. I remember logging onto the Prodigy network when I was younger using dial-up on a diskless 8088. The first ""pornographic"" website I visited was Victoria's Secret, and I fell in lustful jealousy for the first time. I fantasized about them, about the models with angel wings, about what it must be like to have breasts. I probably still have some 3 1/4"" floppies with some of those pictures saved, somewhere. During that time, I was also heavily into science fiction; it didn't matter what series. Star Trek, Star Wars, and Babylon 5 were the most accessible, but I was also reading Aasimov's ""Foundation"" series and a few others at the time.

&#x200B;

AOL opened a whole new world; I met a girl at a Baptist convention that I had attended with my church's youth group, and we exchanged e-mail addresses. This was before instant messaging, and I remember getting home and trading long chains of e-mails back and forth with her. Later, I would get curious and start digging into the .pfc (""personal file cabinet"") files of my dad's e-mail. Before I reached that point, however, I discovered AOL's ""Rhy'Din"" chat rooms, which had a whole host of different-themed fantasy settings and topics, mainly geared towards fantasy role-play. I found and joined a Star Trek role-playing group that met once a week; my parents were less than thrilled to find out about that group. Taking the internet away from me became the only real punishment that they had.

&#x200B;

I found a website, then, from the United Kingdom that was dedicated to stories and images about transformation to horses, donkeys, centaurs, and other equines. I had been role-playing in the Rhy'Din chat rooms (unbeknownst to my parents) as a centaur, at the time, and had already written one or two sex (horribly bad, I'm sure) sex scenes (not as a centaur). I was probably about 13 or 14 at the time. I remember in fairly vivid detail coming in from mowing the lawn, and seeing that website on the computer monitor with both of my parents staring at it. The talk my father and I had after was very short. He asked me why I was on it, and my response was ""It had what I was looking for (I was too embarassed to go into detail and say 'breasts').""

&#x200B;

I was about that same age when I wrote my first BASIC program on a 486-DX33, a choose-your-own-adventure transformation-and-sex story using basic GOTOs and if/then input statements, that allowed me to write and play out my fantasies of becoming different superheroes (I was watching a lot of  'Superfriends' reruns at the time), and pseudo-animals (""furries,"" for those of you aware). I still have copies, somewhere.

&#x200B;

I was also about 12 or 13 when I first discovered the ""Federation II"" Multi-User Dungeon beta, which was heavily advertised on AOL, and was billed as a text-based multiplayer adventure game for adults. Prior to that, most of my experience with text-based games had come from the InfoCom games (Moonmist, a Victorian-era murder-mystery had been my first). I had been using the name ""Paveway22"" on AOL up until this point (A moniker which was the combination of the 'Paveway III' bomb, featured heavily on the Sega Genesis game ""F-117 Nightstalker,"" and the .22 caliber bullet). It was revolutionary to me, in that it had the option to get a sex change (along with other options). I incorrectly assumed that it would also change the pronouns in the description I wrote, and started looking or textsex with strangers.

&#x200B;

In school, I was still made fun of and laughed at for being 'the smart fat kid with glasses.' It didn't help matters when I joined band, and chose to play the flute. I lied and told people it was because it was easy to carry and fit in my backpack; the real reason was because it allowed me to be just a tiny bit more feminine, just a little bit closer to being with 'the other girls.'

&#x200B;

By the time I got to High School, I hated myself and hated my body more. I had begged God to take away my sinful nature on more than one occasion, to make the desires and urges stop. Every time I masturbated, I felt guilt, shame, and remorse after (something that continues to this day). I had written sexually suggestive transformation stories about everyone I'd found attractive, and continued to do so. I had learned how to pick the lock to the computer. I spent hours browsing transformation and sex story repositories on the internet, behind my parents' back, and I spent my lunch hours in the library on different MUDs, some adult, some not, but the adult ones were where what I was looking for. I would trawl through AOL profiles, looking for people to instant message about centaur-themed role-play, and buried myself in books to escape from the people around me that either bullied me, made fun of me, or just ignored me. High School was better, because I was more invisible there.

&#x200B;

I was 16 or 17 when I found Tapestries MUCK (The largest social variant of MUDs, heavy on furry and transformation themes). It was everything that I could want; I wrote sexually suggestive material with strangers, and developed a strong affinity towards BDSM. I was able to play female characters, to 'become' who I wanted, though at the time, I was still intensely guilt-ridden and ashamed to create those characters. On the non-adult MUDs, I was even able to find partners to write adult role-play with. I have been on and off of these different places for the last two decades of my life.

&#x200B;

I found a home on Shangrila MUX the summer after I turned 18. No limits, no-holds-barred, play-anything-you-want. I wasn't alone. I was able to explore all the different fetishes and thoughts that had been accumulating in my head. I'm sure that I was fairly annoying at that time, but I found roleplay partners that enjoyed my company, enjoyed writing weird and odd kink. I created a female character to try and explore that side of myself, and ended up alone and ignored. I joined the Army and went to Basic Training the year after that, and I can't recall the names of the other roleplayers that I met. I remember the name of the domme that I'd met, first, though. Chris, short for Christine, and she sent me a christmas e-card.

&#x200B;

I've been on and off of Shangrila MUX since then, several times. I have written so many sex scenes, so many fetish scenes, so many orgasm scenes that they come second nature to me. I've been writing sexual novelties for the last two decades. In 2014, I came out as transgender. My mom ""didn't believe me."" My family has been supportive, but I know they ""want their son"" back. I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be ""trans."" I don't want to have to explain myself to everyone I come across. I don't want to be ""male."" I'm not willing to be openly and visibly trans, to endure the same ridicule, humiliation and suffering that I did back in middle and high school just to ""be me,"" while having to rely on the comfort of internet strangers because I'm not a viable candidate for a female partner. I'm not willing to put myself at risk of being murdered because someone thinks I'm a monster, or a freak, or a threat to their masculinity or a threat to their children. I don't care what you think about trans people, or furries, or BDSM enthusiasts, or people with weird fetishes.

The Right to be Free	"When I realized that I was trans and saw that it was an attainable future to become the woman I felt I was on the inside, I didn't hesitate in begining that journey. I had already messed up alot of my life trying to ignore who I was and act like I could get by as male. By the time I was ready to come out, I was 33, tattooed all over, had a history or substance abuse, a record, and no living parents/grandparents. The choice was easy: What have I got to lose? I burned my manclothes, and immediately started presenting female full-time before I even made any appointments for HRT. I plunged right in. The one person I have that can be considered family was my fiance, and she was THANKFULLY, onboard.

I wish that we could all just make the plunge so completely and quickly. But that is unrealistic. I realize that by not having living family, I didn't have to worry about them. I was Free to be myself, no strings attatched. The story I hear more often or not has to do with young adults who's familys force them into guilt trips, wont let them live with them and take HRT while they're in college, and many other things that are unreasonable. Sure, some cities in America and other countries havea shelters for youth, or special trangendered programs for those of us booted from home and job after outing ourselves. However, most towns and many cities don't have these programs. Our brothers and sisters out themselves, hoping against all hope for support, only to be taunted, ridiculed, and ostracized by the ones who were supposed to love them unconditionally. These loved ones force them into a corner where the subconscious mind develops unhleathy habits, defense mechanisms, and fears - a terrible foundation for a young adult. Eventually they may be able to get out of that situation, but many times so much damage has been done, and they are thrust into an unforgiving world as a transgendered human with no true family, and the poor foundation that the family destroyed while trying to make it into something it was not. These young people should not feel as if they are imprisoned within their dysphoria. They shouldn't feel afraid to explore who they are. They should be able and allowed to feel FREEDOM.

This can be an unforgiving world. I ran from my family, and from myself for many years from the age of 15 into my adulthood. I know just how unforgiving it can be. It's a shame that it took me being completely alone with no family to be comfortable with myself."		9mubud	trans	9	0.85	2018-10-09 23:41:54
"Opinion on ""sissy"" fetish and subreddits' effect on mental health"	"This post talks about sexuality and some issues that are difficult to talk about.

Hello, I am a trans woman and I think it would be accurate to say that there are many trans women who began their journey through sexuality, and found the ""sissy"" kink as a way to explore this (including me). I have no idea how many of us this affects, I feel like it could be anywhere from like 3% of trans women to 25% of us. First, I'd like to say that I think that it's ok to use your sexuality to explore gender, and I don't have any problem with the trans women who started out as a ""sissy"". There isn't one set way to discover your gender or to go about this transition. However, the ""sissy"" fetish was a traumatic experience for me. It has made everything more confusing, spurred denial, made me feel that being a woman was connected with being ""useless"", and as I begin to feel more valid as a woman, the term ""sissy"" has become a trigger for trauma caused by the fetish. (it feels like a transphobic slur to me) 

The porn in this fetish is problematic, and I don't think it's acceptable to be showing it to young trans women. This pornography hypersexualizes the trans body. The connection between degradation, humiliation, and crossdressing in the fetish is insulting to the validity of trans women's gender identity. Why should it be humiliating to dress as a woman? In addition to this, the attempts at hypnosis and brainwashing are concerning, especially when they prompt drug use. 

I originally wanted to go into a lot more detail but I feel that would be pretty inappropriate and I don't want to subject anyone to that. Anyways, if you have seen this type of porn before, you know about all the other things in such videos.

Yes, it's wrong to kink shame people, and I think people should express their sexuality however they want. However, I think this kink is doing too much harm.  I don't think it's okay that cis men are essentially putting on the face of a trans woman just to humiliate, degrade, or mock. It feeds into negative stereotypes about trans women. I have less of a problem with regular crossdressing and drag.

My question for those who see this: Have you viewed sissy porn, hypnosis/brainwashing, or been involved in the fetish before? Do you feel like it has had a negative effect on your mental health? Does anyone think it was a positive part of their life?"	"Porn in general has a negative effect on people, mostly youth. It's an incredibly unrealistic example of sex in almost every case and causes a lot of harm by creating those kinds of societal expectations. Honestly, no young people should be viewing porn until after they understand real relationships, and the idea of sex, bodily autonomy, and consent. No one should see porn and feel like they have to be that way (or their partner has to be that way) because they have no other frame of reference. Sexual education is severely lacking in a lot of places which cause a whole slew of major problems beyond this, but it's certainly included. 

An adult with more life experience armed with knowledge and compassion can make their own choices after that as long as they're being safe sane and consensual.
I explored this myself in a similar way. I have very little privacy at home, watching actual porn is too risky. Luckily (kinda) this meant that I was forced to explore it in other ways, some of which were more open to interpretation on my end, with erotica captioned images being a major one. I toyed with being a femboy, and with being a sissy, or a trap or whatever, and they all felt wrong, but by then about a year had passed and I had already associated my being trans with sex. I eventually moved on to transformation kinks and once I began to feel more confident in who I am now, I stopped fetish stuff like that all together.

I completely see your point. It's really damaging, and it made me think that my thoughts and desires that I didn't understand were my developing sexuality and that being trans was a fetish, or at least part of it for me. It's what kept me in the closet for so long, and I'd hat for other trans girls to have to go through the same process of doubt and guilt due to not feeling like a ""real trans person"" because I didn't understand.

I don't condone anyone who has participated, or participates in any of these, although they are problematic in and of themselves, often to do with consent and the way women are viewed, but there should be more, healthier ways to learn who you are.
I agree about porn in general. It is designed to be sold as a fantasy. I've been in porn. I'm also a sex educator at every opportunity. 

To be honest, the sissy fetish helped empower me to start towards accepting myself as trans. 

I wish porn could come with some education somehow. The producers loved hiring me because I'd bring nuance and quiz them about what I call ""how gay am I today"". In reality, gay just isn't the right word. The nuances of different parts of female worship spectrum have more degrees than the Kelvin scale. 

The OP appropriately blends disparate feelings and emotions ... Highlights tiny differences of an experience that have vastly different impacts upon people.
I like your inside point of view. Educational porn sounds like a wonderful resource for people. I'd love to learn more about different kinks and how to explore them safely with proper consent. But reading about them isn't always super informative, and I definitely have to read a lot. Plus, some people are practical learners, and words don't stick well. Honestly I'm kind of loving the idea of educational porn now."	no1ufr	trans	11	0.92	2021-05-30 02:41:53
Moving to a transphobic household	"Hi all, I (23 yo MtF) recently moved to London for my studies; I was hoping to find a trans-friendly environment and to explore my gender identity while here, but I've not been as lucky as I hoped to be.  
The thing is, my flatmates are not very accepting of trans people. I happened to meet one of them in the hallway while wearing mascara and nail polish, and while initially he was friendly, his expression changed drastically upon taking a close look at me and he ended our conversation immediately. The other two simply avoided eye contact entirely and glared down at my polished nails when they saw me, yet right now I feel a mix of fear and embarrassment when thinking about cross-dressing, and had to hide all of my make-up material in a drawer in my room to prevent them from accidentally seeing it. In other words, I'm uncomfortable to be myself in this environment. I also especially wanted to start voice training while here, but with the scarce sound insulation we have I no longer feel confident enough to do it. It's a shame because my family has actually been very supportive when I came out to them, but I can't go back home until I finish my study, so I'm stuck here for at least six months before I can move somewhere else.  
Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Could you give me any tip? Also, is there any trans-friendly space in London where I can go without worrying about external judgement?"	"[https://londonlgbtqcentre.org/](https://londonlgbtqcentre.org/)  I found this one maybe you could start looking for a new roommate/place to live here? Sorry to hear that ur current one is shit. Best of luck on ur journey, friend :)
Sorry that I can't help.  But I just have to comment about how ridiculous it is that you got that reaction from just mascara and nail polish.  Those aren't that weird for even a cishet guy to wear these days.  I live in Utah, the home of the LDS church, and wearing those things around my Mormon friends that I'm not out to never caused anything like that.  I could understand places like the deep South of the U.S. or the middle east where any expression is seen as gay and being gay is seen as sinning.  But London?  It sounds like your flatmates need to get out more.  If they react that way to nail polish they'd probably call a priest if you told them your gender.  I'm really sorry you're in that situation.
I know, it does feel like shit. The 'suddenly unfriendly' flatmate is an Italian from the South who's been a factory worker most of his life, though, so I understand that his context was not the most friendly to queer people. Still, I just didn't expect to meet close-minded people in Camden out of all places.

Really disliking my stepmum rn	"Im spending a couple of weeks with her and my dad in TERF Island and yeah she's just a massive TERF. I'm out to her as transfem but haven't asked her to call me by my preferred names or pronouns. She's always been difficult but it's even worse this time, probably because of her HRT for menopause (sidenote: there are literally oestrogen pills in this house someone hold me back pls).

She has made no effort to change anything about how she treats me and still frequently refers to me as a boy, or even worse, a bloke. That term specifically gas always bothered me. It makes me feel pretty dysphoric but i know correcting her will just add conflict. She found out my name when I left my email open on her laptop (rookie move, logged off Youtube but not Chrome) but hasn't said anything. I casually mentioned that it's a shame I'll have to drop my email cause it's basically my full deadname, and I swear I caught her shaking her head and sighing.

The funny thing is my dad reckons she's afraid this will get in the way of me moving out and getting a job back home when this is literally the only motivation I have to do both those things. As I told Dad, she's just gonna have to get used to it. This isn't going away."		vnqqdr	trans	10	0.92	2022-06-29 21:26:02
I cannot make the one impotant phone call I need to and I feel fucking stupid	"This would be the first step for me in getting hormones and I can't fucking do it. Somehow calling someone and telling them I'm trans and whatnot just seems so impossible even though they deal with trans people on the regular, and it is literally their job. And I'm just so scared I cannot do it. I want noone else to be present nearby while I try to get an apointment with the therapist, because I feel so much shame from saying ""I'm trans"" out loud. I came out to my mom some time ago and while she has been pretty accepting for the most part, recently she started misgendering me and I'm too embarassed to even correct her. I look into the mirror and I cannot say that I'm a woman without feeling shameful or crying. I feel ridiculous for even having this problem"	"So sorry you're feeling down about this. I hope you can be gentle and forgiving of yourself. You've never done this before and it's all hella stressful. I say take the time you need and take some of that pressure off.
I’m sorry❤️Could you email them instead? Sending you love
do you necessarily need to even say the words ""i'm trans""? i'm sure they would still understand why you would be calling. also, i understand how hard it can be to say it out loud, i'm still building up the courage to say the word ""transgender"" when talking with my therapist. sending love ❤❤❤
I have had a huge block over saying I’m trans / NB to people. Still can’t commit tbh. But I have found that the more people (who are supportive) that I’ve told, the easier it is to do it. The first time it was to my wife and it was really hard, but since then it has been a bit easier. You could try talking to anyone else if you trust them. You could also try writing a script and reading off it.

Sending u hugs ❤️
I started figuring myself out in April and barely made any progress since and that also really bothers me that im taking so long, but I cannot get myself to do things faster. Sorry for the incoherent rambling in both the original post and this one. And thank you so much for the reply ❤
I still might have to call them even if I email them first, I'm not exactly sure. Even though just the act of reaching out is making me feel not good, an email first would probably make the proceeding phone call a lot easier, if I have to do that.


❤❤❤
I'm gonna have to talk about it no matter what. But posting this and reading the replies helped a bit.

Thank you so much
❤❤❤
It's a hella lot to figure out. One thing I've learned the hard way in life is to avoid making big decisions when I'm in a significant life change. It's okay to wait for the time it takes for our brains to get back to normal and into a calmer decision making place.

Progress I think can be a misleading goal. Consider what makes you feel authentic and happy.

Just ideas. Feel free to pick or discard these as you see fit.
Yeah and maybe if you do have to end up calling, once you’ve already written it in an email you probably wouldn’t have to say it again over the phone! Good luck😽❤️❤️"	q92gq8	trans	10	1.0	2021-10-16 01:54:03
"Shame on the LGB ""Community"""			qr8z73	trans	10	0.92	2021-11-11 00:58:17
I’m a closeted woman and I’ll probably never come out	"  Growing up I adored playing with my sister’s Barbie’s, Polly Pocket, anything cute and brightly colored and fashionable. I was never a fan of aggressively masculine sports or cars like my dad and brother wanted me to be. I still did and learned about those things, because I just wanted my family to be happy. 

   When puberty hit I had an aching in my breasts that I would constantly feel. It’s as if I could feel I was developing breasts that weren’t really there. When I saw an attractive man I got a sensation in my nether-region that wasn’t my male genitals. It’s as if I had a vagina that I could feel that wasn’t really there. 
   Whenever I expressed myself in a girly, or what could even be perceived as feminine way, I would be punished severely. My father was a very strict and anti-LGBTQ+ man. And every-time he caught me drawing something like a cute dress or playing with a girl targeted toy he would throw it away/tear it up/punish me.
  To combat any femininity in my physical appearance, my parents would buzz-cut my hair and clip my nails every month. I would hate the feeling of stubble on my scalp, I felt like I was ugly. 
   In my freshman year of highschool I saved up my money from my job and purchased a wig as an excuse of it being for a Halloween costume. It was a long blonde silky straight wig that rested almost at my elbows. When I put it on in the mirror i felt empowered. I felt like I looked more beautiful than I ever had in my whole life. 
 Eventually my parents saw the wig, they bought my excuse for having it but I knew it was best to not have any suspicion my way. I gave the wig I had saved so much for away to my school’s theatre department. It broke my heart.
   No one in my family knows and I’ve never told anyone. It’s been years since then, but whenever I look in the mirror, all I can see is a woman fighting to get out. Struggling to keep herself alive.

   I’ll never let that woman out of me. I’m tall, broad-boned, muscular, and considered a very attractive man wherever I go. It feels too late to transition and be who I really am, and I feel like if I came out and did it now I’d be a laughingstock and bring shame to my family.
   I can feel the woman inside of me, Veronica. She wants to wear bras, she wants to stroll down the street in a sundress, she wants to buy makeup shame-free, she wants to get married, start a family, she wants to be happy. But I don’t think I could ever let myself."	"God your story hits hard.  You’ve had bad dysphoria your entire life and your parents treated you like shit because of it.  As far as I’m concerned that was emotionally abusive.  That treatment obviously doesn’t stop dysphoria.

I hope you give Veronica a chance to be free.  You’re keeping her shackled deep inside.  Freeing the girl inside is so difficult.  We build so many walls, so many defenses to both hide her from the world and protect her from it.

It’s okay to transition later in life.  I am doing it in my early 40’s.  It is difficult no matter when we do it.  Before I transitioned I said that I would be the same person before and after.  While it’s true that obviously I’m the same human, my personality has been unshackled enough that I feel like I’m a different person than I used to be in some ways.  I’m glad that he didn’t end up killing himself.  Im scared of how my transition will go but I’m so happy he gave me the chance to do it.

I feel happy.  I have breasts.  I like my body for the first time ever.  There are obviously difficulties but feeling comfortable in your own skin is something everyone should have the chance to experience.  When I started liking my body and I realized that this is how cis people get to be for just existing, I was shocked.  Sure they may not like aspects of themselves.  Their nose or their eye shape or their weight or WHATEVER but they are comfortable just existing.  Just existing prior to HRT made me want to jump in front of a train, off a bridge or take way too much tylonel.  

Please reconsider your decision to keep Veronica chained in a prison behind walls.  She wants a chance to live and exist and experience life.  She’s you and you deserve to be your best self.❤️
It's never too late to transition, and honestly, a family that punishes you for expressing your gender instead of supporting you doesn't deserve your caring about whether or not they are shamed by you. (Tip: There's nothing shameful about having a family member come out as trans, and any belief they have to the contrary is their problem, not yours).
It might sound cliche, but it's never too late. I started when I was 27 after years of feeling the same way you do, that I could never let her out. But I did, and it was the best decision I've ever made. What's stopping you?
It's never too late"	tpwon1	trans	10	1.0	2022-03-28 00:05:54
(19 Nonbinary AMAB) So, I've been feeling some things recently and I want to know if I'm trans or just curious/horny	"•General discomfort when referred to as a man

•Wish I had boobs on a semi-regular basis

•Bisexual, wish I was female because it would be easier/more understood to be a girl who likes girls than a guy who likes guys

•Desire to wear skirts

•Wish I didn't have hair on my belly so I could show it off (crop tops, etc)

I decided to go NB recently and have experienced some euphoria since, but I've never experimented with female clothing/pronouns for fear of shame from others, and thus don't know how I would feel if I did so. Thus, I don't know if these things I'm feeling can be attributed to mere curiosity (e.g. skirts) or horniness (e.g. boobs). 

I figured I should get some outside input, which is why I made this post. I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have."	"This sounds like you are trans, the best way to know would be to experiment and explore what you find comfortable. 

Plenty of trans people feel dysphoric about their genitals and there is nothing wrong with wanting the opposite set and there is also nothing wrong with not having a problem with them. Even if there are feelings of it being sexual it doesn't exclude you from being trans. 

The best advice I would have is to find people you can talk to about this as support is always helpful. Don't give yourself the goal of transitioning but find the identity that suits you in all aspects of life and a few years down the line when you are sure about making changes then you can transition in the ways that help you live how you want.

This is what I've seen from my experiences but I only realised that I was trans about 2 months ago so it might not be as applicable to you as all situations may be different.
If it would make you happier to be trans than you are trans, the entry criteria are just making the choice and accepting it.
Hi, first of all, only you can answer that question. To be able to do that, I encourage you to experiment. You have a desire to wear skirts? Wear skirts. You wish you didn’t have hair on your belly? Shave it... worst case scenario it will come back :D find close friends to call you with your preferred names and pronouns as an experiment. Boobs? Wear fake boobs and try to really ask yourself how you feel. It seems that before labelling yourself as trans or not, you need to try different things. All those things can be done in the privacy of your home, in a safe space.
If you need help to gather your thoughts, go see a gender therapist. They will guide you in finding yourself.
In the end, you are young, you have all the time in the world.

Happy self discovery!
Do you ever feel like a girl trapped in a male body?
Not really, but 1. I don't quite know what that means and 2. I hear that's not a requirement/certainty
You might just be a non binary who likes to dress as a woman. Not totally sure."	kcb5ks	trans	12	1.0	2020-12-13 14:06:12
Questioning no longer being stealth (MtF)	"I transitioned over a decade ago and, for the most part, nobody in my life really knows my past or my ""big secret"". But over the past few years I've especially found this difficult as I have feel so much anxiety and stress like I have so much weight on my shoulders trying to keep this all a secret. I find I still get triggered by things that may happen or may be said, but am ultimately forced to entirely internalize these issues and feelings without an outlet. There's also an element of shame/embarrassment that I have simply for the fact of being ""trans"" vs ""a real woman""...

&#x200B;

Obviously things have changed significantly over the past decade+ and especially the past 5 years. Now I know people actually know what transgender means, acceptance has skyrocketed, etc. etc.

&#x200B;

And so, a huge part of me wants to unload this huge burden that I carry around, trying to keep everything a secret... and while I'm not sure I'm suddenly going to become an overnight activist or be shouting it from the rooftops, the idea of not carrying around this huge weight on my shoulders sounds like such a nice relief.

&#x200B;

Back when I transitioned, passing privilege and going stealth, etc. etc. were often seen as the ultimate goal. But I also sort of thought I'd ""finish my transition"" and be able to move on with my life, but the reality I have long since realized is that I will in fact always be trans, and it will always be a (big) part of who I am, even if it doesn't or I don't let it define me.

&#x200B;

The huge, huge, huge dilemma I feel like I face is that once you decide to no longer live stealth, it's not really something you can feasibly undo. Moving away and ""starting over"" in a worst case scenario isnt even something I'd consider this point in my life.

&#x200B;

So... yeah, a bit of a blabber but I am ultimately struggling with the idea of continuing to live stealth, and continuing to carry the burden of secrecy/deal with the issues it carries... vs being more open about who I am and my lived experience... being moreso my authentic self.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts from you all?"	"Hi I transitioned 20 years ago. I spent about a decade being stealth at work because I was afraid I'd lose my job. Like you it took a huge social and emotional toll on me. I had a fiance and friends that I could be open with but we lived in a rural area so my 'outness' was only at my home and only when there were people I trusted. Eventually we moved to the city and I still wasn't out at a new job, I figured the city was safer to be out but it still took me time to work up courage to come out at my current employer. I actually ended up running the corporate lgbt employee resource program and I found it very rewarding and made a lot of good friends by being able to be out and be confident in myself as an out transgender person. When I wasn't out I felt completely marginalized and alone at work and it was starting to give me panic attacks because I was afraid of losing my career or being marginalized for the foreseeable future. I've started to feel like ""going stealth"" is just a gilded cage we construct for ourselves to justify our own self imposed marginalization.  I work for a big company so I have found some little pockets of transphobia but for the most part my team loves me and supports me and has allowed me to grow in ways I never thought I could. I've even had folks stand up to bullies on my behalf without asking me because I was too afraid to push back. I have shared essays about my life experience publicly on our corporate message boards so I'm definitely out to folks beyond my team. It's going to be a YMMV situation depending on your circumstances. So don't out yourself unless you're strong enough to deal with loss or bullying. At the same time it is a liberating, now I feel like a mammabear to the transgender community at work and I really don't want to go back to living stealth. My career has actually started to flourish and my job satisfaction is higher than ever I've even been fast tracked for promotions. If  you'd like to DM is be happy to discuss my circumstances with you.
I agree and am in a similar situation. Except, I have a fiancé who would rather I was not out. He really doesn't like my past, and we really can't talk about it. It is a lot to carry around, and when i see other people who are out I feel jealous and betrayal. Can't see it changing for me for a while, but I wish i knew how to be a little bit out.
Only force yourself to be stealth if it makes you happy.

Remember, if you choose to ""come out the other way,"" you will help destroy the myth that people can ""always tell"" if someone is transgender by looking at or talking to them.
I feel ya!

I lived a shell version of myself my whole life. I missed out on a lot! Fear and shame were two very big motivators to keep it all to my self. 

My egg cracked and I do really wish others to see me as I am! I know for a very long time (perhaps till I die) others wont see me as a cis woman but always at best as a transwoman and at worst some kind of freak:( But to be honest in my mind that's starting to get a less and less of a concern for me. Thanks to this loving community and all its support I finally had the guts to go onwards in my life:)

I feel so much now better now:)

we can chat some more if you like just DM me\^\^
if you think it'd help you, you should do it! i would start by maybe telling a close friend or a few close friends. i find having one or two friends that know lifts the weight enough for me to feel comfortable living stealth in the rest of my life. if that goes well, maybe you'll feel more comfortable coming out at work, etc., or maybe you'll feel content in those people knowing and decide instead not to. just my thoughts.
I really don't know how you do it. I don't think I could ever hide myself away again after coming out. I definitely couldn't spend my life with someone who forced me to do so. Obviously my whole existence isn't about being trans, but it certainly is a part of my life that's helped shape who I am as a person and I live that openly.
I'm sorry to hear that!

I have a gf that when we started dating I kept no secrets from and even for her its still a really weird concept. Even though she 100% accepts me for who I am she expressed to me that she feels no attraction to women at all. I'll have to respect that and there might be a chance she and I will eventually become good friends instead of partners...
Yeah I feel the same way after about a decade living stealth. It really exhausting being so guarded all the time.
When I changed, it was very fashionable to go stealth, so I did. I completely dropped out of the community for years (from 2007 to 2020), it was only covid and my kidney failure that woke me up and brought me back.

And, i love my partner and he loves me. It is part of our deal. It isn't really a problem for me. I don't think he even realises much about our community, or what pride is.
I think it is super hard for our partners to understand, i can imagine that those words would have hurt alot. Mine definitely thinks his position is normal, and that all of us really want to hide. He was astounded when one of us publicly spoke at his word, he asked me why she would do that.
I don't know if I could do it. I feel like it would bring on some serious issues with both trust and perpetual lingering doubts about sincerity. It seems like there's a ton of internalized transphobia on his part to work through if he refuses to even acknowledge and discuss something so significant.

I understand there's some differences in our situations since I came out after nearly a decade an a half with my wife and we're of a different generation and culture than you. She's right by my side every step of the way and will completely tear someone apart to keep me safe. 

I'm not aggressive or borderline militant about being trans like some people are, but I never hide it much either. Being trans is part of my life, and I'm very much willing to talking about it with well-intentioned people, but it isn't the basis of my character. I want to help remove the stigma by living my absolute best - and incredibly average - life openly.
It might be something lost in translation, but don’t quite understand the second part of your reply, could you elaborate?
It is weird with him, he isn't transphobic, he talks to my only trans friend. But never about my past. And, he loves me. Although, if he had known before he did, I expect he would have dumped me, but that is kinda normal for straight guys og my generation! (I am not that old!) 

Anyway, good luck with your wife, you are really lucky to have her! I used to hang out in clubs where almost everyone was divorced over this.
What, the part about the lady at his work? He assumed that we were all like me, living in stealth, never speaking about our past. It hadn't occurred to him that some. Of us are out, after transistion.

God fucking damnit, I hate gender envy	"Me: I'm happy
Brain: Oh look, it's someone you wish to look like. It's a shame you never will
Me: *Fucking annoyed *

It's my first time feeling gender envy, is the annoyance normal?"	"its totally normal to feel anger/annoyance/etc any number of emotions about stuff like this. the only point at which it becomes bad is if you start taking it out on either yourself or the person you envy (this includes stuff like commenting “i’ll never pass like you” etc- even intended as a compliment, it puts the other person in a really uncomfortable situation). please try not to beat yourself up for having these feelings. it does really suck to have them but they are normal feelings. easier said than done, but it’s good to acknowledge those feelings and let yourself feel them without guilt or hate or anything. by making this post, you are acknowledging the feeling and that’s good! sometimes even just writing it out and writing about it takes away some of its power. sitting with negative emotions is very uncomfortable but it’s better than forcing them down- this is a hard lesson to learn and it’s taken me a long time to start working on it. you’re not gonna get it right away but you will get it and it’ll become more bearable.

also, you can’t look like every person you want to look like, but that doesn’t mean you don’t look cool as fuck. that’s another thing that’s taken me a long time to understand. just because you’re not your own type doesn’t mean you’re not beautiful and i hope that there are some things you really vibe with about yourself. also, nothing wrong with adopting people’s style and mannerisms! we are all a mix of people we’ve known, and if you like something you can make it part of you. hell, i stole my exes whole gender presentation. that’s life baby!!! you got this!!

First day on T, transphobic parents, need advice	"Hi, I apologise in advance as this post may be long but I’m in serious need of some advice. 

I’m a 22 year old transmasc living in the UK. I first came out at 14 to my friends, starting using he/him, new name, couldn’t present masc as my parents would not allow me. They eventually found out I was trans by looking through my phone and the first day they confronted me they pretended to accept me, so I would tell them everything I felt, then once they got the information out of me they did a full 180 and told me I’d ruined their lives, almost ruined their marriage, and they’d rather me be pregnant with triplets at 14 than “saying this”. All I’d said was how much I wanted to be a boy and how distressed I felt at being a girl. I tried to fight them on it but they took away my phone, internet, didn’t let me see certain friends, took all my male / masculine belongings I’d been hiding under my bed and kept them in their bedroom until they “figured out what to do with them” and then binned them. They took me to therapy, the therapists were supportive of my identity so they pulled me out of it and punished me further. I fought it with them but eventually had to give in, go back in the closet, and try and repress how I felt.

Gender dysphoria kept popping up over the years but I kept pushing it down. It reared its head in every relationship I was in, I felt so dysphoric being seen as a woman. I kept ignoring it and pushing it down because I knew I couldn’t go through how my parents treated me again. I moved out and went to university and was convinced I couldn’t transition and would just have to “cope” with being a girl. I got my BSc this summer and moved into a new place with my best friend. I got a full time job paying a decent wage and realised that now I am completely independent, maybe I can transition. 

I started my masters degree in September and since then my dysphoria has been getting worse and worse. I came out as NB first to test the waters with friends. They were all super accepting and supportive. I was shocked that people were supportive. I went to see a doctor about testosterone. I was shocked at how kind and respectful he was towards me. I thought maybe I really can transition. I had friends at university transition and I was so jealous of them but felt in my heart I couldn’t do that for whatever reason. 

Today I started T and it was the biggest relief. I felt so happy and relieved and free when the dr approved me for testosterone. But now my head is swamped with worry because of my family. I am financially independent and I live in my own rented property with my friend, but I live in the same city as my family, and with time they will notice and I have no idea how to even discuss it with them given how it went the first time. Also every year around the holidays my mum brings up my original transition and tells me how it really wasn’t the right decision and how she saved me from it. I have an amazing strong solid group of long term friends who are supportive and I have some very close friends I would trust with my life and know everything about my parents. I went to trauma therapy for two years during my BSc because of how they had treated me both in terms of transness and in general. I don’t know how to deal with this as I just feel very scared haha. Has anyone been in a similar situation or have similar parents and can offer some advice on how to deal with the eventual fallout of having to tell them / how to even tell them ? Do I even tell them? 

Also, any advice on how to rid my mind of their toxic shame ?"	"You are amazing and brave just for being you and accepting your truth.

I'm going to head off any of the ""cut off contact"" responses by saying this: turn that negativity and your pride into a weapon. Show your parents that this is you, and they can sucks eggs if they won't accept it.

Own this life, don't let your parents control it for you.
You don’t have to tell them anything. You’re your own independent person, and they have no power over you. If they notice your transition, good for them, they can either accept you or get out of the way. Set boundaries of basic respect and be very clear about them. If they break those boundaries, feel free to distance yourself as much as possible. Who needs a shitty transphobic biological family when it sounds like you have an accepting, loving, chosen family in your friend group?

I wish you all the best, and remember the only person who dictates who you are is YOU. You are not their hate or their shame or their ignorance, you are your own whole person, who has every right to exist the way they want and do what they want to do.
Okay but what exactly is wrong with telling someone to cut off contact with abusive people? Obviously not as a first resort, but if they refuse to come around I don’t see how NC is unreasonable.
It's almost universally the most common response reddit gives whenever someone mentions having difficulty in any kind of relationship.

It should be the last response a lot of the time, and people don't tend to give conflict resolution advice.

It just a pet peeve of mine to see it so often

Trans representation in media is so important - HBO’s Euphoria helped me accept myself as trans	"In the past I was a little ashamed to admit that a TV show played a key role in me finally taking the plunge to transition. I used to feel like it trivialized my rationale for transitioning, as if I was chasing a fad or making a spurious decision. But after lots of self-reflection I’m realizing that the reason Euphoria had such a major impact on me was because of how little exposure I’ve had to trans people in popular culture. 

I began to experience major gender dysphoria at the onset of puberty, which led me to consider transitioning from MTF. For 12 years I resisted taking the plunge because I had a warped viewpoint of what it meant to be trans. In my mind, transitioning meant that I had to become some sort of bimbo with fake boobs. I thought it would change me into something so fundamentally different from myself that I wouldn’t even be a normal person anymore.

For so long my perceptions were based on a limited and warped understanding of what it meant to be trans. My exposure to trans people was almost exclusively though porn. I couldn’t name five celebrities that were trans, and I had never seen any movie or TV show with a major trans character. I also didn’t know a single trans person IRL, not even an acquaintance. It’s clear to me now how devastatingly damaging that was to me. How could I embrace being trans if I had no clue what that even meant?

There were a confluence of factors that finally pushed me to start transitioning, but I can’t discount the impact that watching one season of Euphoria had on me. Never in my life have I related to a fictional character like I have to Jules, a trans girl played by trans actress Hunter Schafer. It finally opened my eyes to the potential of what I could become - that I could be a real person, that I could keep my own aesthetic and personality, that I could integrate into society. These are concepts that I might have ultimately learned on my own, but with Euphoria it hit me hard and it was exactly what I needed. I just wish there had been more content with trans representation when I first started to experience gender dysphoria.

Anyway, I just wanted to put this out there because the second season is premiering tonight and these thoughts have been on my mind lately. This week marks one year since I’ve started HRT, and I don’t think I’ve ever been happier with myself. My only regret is not starting sooner, and I often feel shame that it took me so long to transition. I thought I’d share my experience because I’m curious if anyone else struggled with a similar predicament."		s03khl	trans	9	1.0	2022-01-09 22:34:39
Am I just kidding myself?	"I am AFAB. I really feel as if I'm transgender (FtM). My problem is that my experience doesn't seem to fit the classic formula and I'm afraid I'm just kidding myself. 

When I was little I always wanted to watch Pokemon and superheroes and action movies. I wanted to play with hot wheels and play videogames. I preferred bugs and reptiles to horses and cats. 

But, I also watched Barbie and Bratz. I used to dress up and play princesses with my cousin, though I never dressed up as a princess outside of those occasions. I remember preferring the masculine things more, but it's not like I didn't enjoy the feminine things as well.

I didn't have a problem with puberty. In fact, I didn't care about my body image at all or what puberty entailed. It just didn't really register as anything special. I also had a period where I constantly wore makeup and girly clothes and would hardly be seen without them. In fact I still find makeup fun to do to this day.

But, my friends and I used to be super into roleplaying when we were younger and we'd have huge texting conversations dedicated to a roleplay. I can't ever remember playing a girl in those scenarios. I always play a boy when I can, whether it's the male version of myself or a character. Even now when I play D&D I have much more fun when playing as a male. 

I stopped wearing girly stuff and started wearing baggy sweatshirts and pants to try and hide my body shape. I shaved off most of my hair and cut it down. I stopped wearing makeup for looks and have taken to only doing it for fun now or if I need to get dolled up for interviews and things. 

I've created this image of myself in my mind and it's a male now. I don't feel comfortable seeing myself as a girl and I dissociate with my body to keep from feeling dysphoric. That or avoid the mirror. I don't feel dysphoria often, but when I do it's so intense that I break down crying and choose not to go out in public, since I'm already feeling dysphoric and don't want to be misgendered as well.

When I think of my body I imagine having a man's body. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable to think of my genitals as female. In fact I can't remember the last time I used the proper feminine terms for my body, instead choosing to use male descriptors and finding them much more suitable. I used to be able to read ""x reader"" fics and enjoy them, but having the character that is supposed to be me referred to as female feels so wrong now that I can't read them anymore or I have to find the male versions, which are much harder to come by. 

In gym class or any class when they would sort boys and girls, I always hesitated and felt gravitated towards the boys side. I wanted to be on the boys side. I always felt like I was being shamed and forced into a role over something as simple as splitting up the class between boys and girls. When asked on forms what my gender is or what pronouns I prefer, I don't know what to say. I know that I want to say male, but for fear of being discriminated against, I write female.

I want to transition and would in a heartbeat, but I'm terrified that no matter how much surgery or treatment I get, I will never pass. I'm 5' even and my body is incredibly curvy. My face is far too soft to be masculine and my voice is a whole other story. If I could have been born a boy, I'm sure I would be much happier with myself and my body, but thinking of going through a full transition only to not pass terrifies me to the point that I put the thought away and convince myself I'm fine being female.

Similarly, I'm not good at asserting myself, so I'd have a rough time enforcing my pronouns and correcting people if need be. I hate to be a nag or feel like I've said something too many times and have gotten annoying with it. (Not saying that this is how I perceive other trans people when they correct me on pronouns, but it's how I feel I'm being percieved.) I don't mind female pronouns, but it always feels so much better when people refer to me with male pronouns or mistake me for a boy. I like it when I hear a kid ask their mom if I'm a boy or a girl, because it means I'm close to passing. I love when I work customer service and the customer calls me ""young man"" or something of the sort. I have even been going by a male name for 4 years now.

The problem is...I want a male body. But, I want to still wear girly things and makeup. I want to look like a boy, sound like a boy, and have a male body, but I also want to be able to wear makeup and a wig from time to time. I try to tell myself that that stuff doesn't mean I'm not trans, since I can wear makeup and dresses now, but I hate the body underneath. I want to look girly on rare occasions, but I don't want to be a girl.

Can I really say I'm transgender if my ideal image of myself is a male body who occasionally wears women's clothes and makeup? 

I mean my main style is graphic tees and baggy pants, but I'd miss being able to do makeup if I transitioned and I don't feel like that should be something I have to give up, but I also feel like...I'm just kidding myself."	"Listen all of that stuff that you've layed on the table there has no weight over your gender identity it only ever matters how you feel, not how you act. If you feel like you're a boy just be a boy whether he be super masculine or enjoys more feminine things such as make up or wearing womens clothes it doesn't matter and anyone who tell you it does is an ass hole.
Just be you in whatever form that takes, don't overthink it. 
I support you
Just be YOU. Who ever that is 💕 you can be male and still enjoy feminine things.  Who ever says otherwise is wrong. Feminine guys are just as valid as masculine ones. Just do what ever will make you happy. 
I feel like I just read about myself. Interesting and good to know I'm not the only one experiencing this. If it helps, when I was younger I would say ""I'm a feminine boy, not a masculine girl."" Now, I just call myself a ""soft boy"" and from what I've learned there's nothing wrong with that. The world could always use more soft boys. 
Good luck on your journey of self discovery x)
You sound just like me, aside from the makeup but I used to do it all the time. There are times when I'm anxious that I'm just lying to myself, but I came out at my current job and used a male marker, and I'm honestly so happy. But there are times when I think about starting HRT and I'm anxious: What if I'm wrong?!? and then there are times when I think about start HRT and I would take it from someone right now and do it and be so excited.

&#x200B;

I think that's just part of it, for me at least. There are things I regret in life. Now I'm terrified of regretting other things, but I feel like I just need to jump in, because thinking of myself as male makes me so happy, I recently started seriously working out just because I want to be under the max weight for top surgery.

&#x200B;

As for wearing feminine coded things sometimes: Do you! There are plenty of cis men who do stuff like that. People might think its 'weird' but I think you should be you, and I'm rooting for you! You 100% can say you're trans, I'm sure most people here would agree that even if someone's a transman they don't have to strictly adhere to what society considers masculine. Be you!
It sounds like your a trans guy.  And remember plenty of cis guys cross dress because they enjoy feeling girly and cute and dolled up sometimes too.
From what you've said, i feel like you are trans. As for makeup and clothes, wear and do whatever you want. Always be yourself
I needed to hear this, thank you. You're absolutely right, I'm just terrified that if I come out as trans and wear makeup, people will tell me I'm not actually trans. It feels nice to have someone tell me that I can still be a boy regardless.
Soft boy! I love it! That is adorable! Thank you so much, and good luck in your own!
Thank you. It means a lot to have someone help validate these feelings I'm having. So thank you so much!"	ba1crb	trans	9	1.0	2019-04-06 05:56:57
My first bra	Today I received my first bra and breast forms. I haven't started any medical transition yet, so I still look like a masculine 50 year old. But putting them on with a loose top, I wanted to cry happy tears. Part of me thinks I'm being silly. I was almost shaking slipping them on, and couldn't hold back the biggest smile. After a lifetime of shame and guilt over what I felt. I could see my true self starting to emerge from the mirror. She's beautiful. I can't wait to meet her fully realized. Merry Yuletide/Christmas to everyone.	"Congrats!
Thank you 😊"	rnxr0g	trans	8	0.84	2021-12-24 23:46:14
She and Her	"**He** walked through life, *she* was outside.

Found out young, **One** did not belong.

Light snuffed out, must abide.

A tunnel endless, made of pain and shame.

**He** walked, maybe *she* was gone?

Looking for redemption, finding none.

&#x200B;

**He** walked through life, *she* still outside.

New starts, bad endings, broken hearts

Tried to be free, but ran to hide.

A sea to drown in, no message in the bottle.

**He** walked, maybe *she* was gone?

Looking for meaning, never done.

&#x200B;

**He** walked through life, *she* now in his mind.

A tiny light, breaking through the wall of spite.

**He** met Another, She was sweet and kind.

Crawling out of the cave, evolution goes slowly.

***They*** walked together, no longer alone.

Not quite there yet, but *she* feels at home.

&#x200B;

Parallel worlds, **body** and *mind*.

Slowly merging, becoming one of a kind.

No harmony there, **One** has to get out.

Trying to express, but can't find the route.

Afraid of *her*, of losing the Other.

A love wanted and needed, but only when given.

Tentatively measuring, finding *her* courage.

*She* has to come out, *she* wants Her acceptance

The Other, the love, redemption, heart racing.

Now running wild, *her* evolution is changing.

&#x200B;

**She** can be, no longer *he*, now set free."	"I absolutely love this. It brings so much feeling of fear of hiding ,longing to be free to be who you are inside and finding some to accept you for who you are. Don't stop writing this is beautiful

How to cope with Misgendering?	"Hey all! 

I got misgendered for the first time in over a year today (FTM, I've been on T for almost 2 years and have had top surgery 6 months ago) I was at work, wearing my mask and this customer turned to me and called me a Lady, and I was so in shock. 

I didn't say anything-- I feel more regret/shame than anything, why couldn't I have corrected them? Why didn't I? 

As well as, do I really not pass? What am I doing wrong? 

I guess I just wanted to ask-- how do you cope when you get misgendered? How do you shake it off? 

I keep telling myself I'm a guy and I know that and that's all that matters but it's been a tough night my friends."	"I tell myself that it also happens to cis people and that it isn't just because I am trans. It still really sucks but that helps me.
That’s really tough, I would cry for a week after getting misgendered, luckily it hasn’t happened in a while but who knows.

I hope you get gendered correctly ❤️
Try to consider it was without malice? You did nothing wrong ... And obviously you're doing great if it's been a year. 

I've been contemplating misgendering myself but have had it in public only once and I accepted their subsequent awkward as an almost apology.

We must go on through life assuming the best in others.
Honestly, at this point, my mind filters out instances of people calling me ""he"" and replaces it with ""she"". Same with my deadname to my current name.

But when someone calls me a man, sir, or boy, then I hear it. 

I just mentally think ""they must be blind or confused."" And correct them briefly. If they keep going, then I know they are just jerks and aren't worth my effort.

You probably had an androgynous look at an angle and they resorted to guessing, without actually looking. I wouldn't dwell too much on it.
Im pre everything and I get misgendered all the fucking time and idk how I deal with it, I just get sad or frustrated....or both
Best comment. Was going to say this. 2 years on T, if someone misgenders you, then they would have misgendered a cis male. It does happen to cis people sometimes. Still sucks though.
Oh that's super helpful!! Thank you 💫
Yeah that makes sense with the androgynous angle! I do work in a cook/bake shop and everyone else who works there is a woman, so I guess them making a guess with that context makes sense. Thanks for the comment! Found it helpful
Yeah, I know it dosent help everyone but it has helped me.
Glad to be of help!😁"	k9kvpt	trans	10	0.86	2020-12-09 04:24:22
Need some advice about my sexual orientation	"I'm not sure what to think about my sexuality anymore. Ever since I was a 10 year old, I've dressed up in women's clothing and enjoyed it. But i usually did it for purely sexual reasons; not necessarily to be a woman, but I got off on the fact that I looked hot in girls clothes. I loved the way I looked as a girl sexually and wanted others to see me as a sex object, but I would rarely go in public. As a teenager, I dated girls and enjoyed having sex with them for the most part. I love the female body and really enjoyed having female sex partners, which is confusing because I really want to be the girl when I'm having sex, but I still would pursue females because I wasn't sexually attracted to men physically, just mentally in my fantasies. I would always fantasize about a man having sex with me as a woman, or a woman having sex with me as a woman. 

&#x200B;

I guess what I'm getting at is, my trans feelings are tied up in my sexuality and not necessarily in my wanting to live my life as a woman. I'm worried that I'm only having these feelings because I want to experience sex as woman, not because I want to live a life as a woman. Is that the same thing or am I just sexualizing the whole thing and not viewing it as a holistic change. I wouldn't want to come out to my family as trans if what I'm really experiencing is just sexual fantasies that I could potentially satiate with a willing partner rather than live as a female.

&#x200B;

To summarize, I live life as a man and have sex with a woman most of the time, but I fantasize sexually about being a girl and having sex as a girl. I have gone through crossdressing periods where I have gone out as a woman and really enjoyed it, but purely from a sexual point of view. I liked thinking that other people were viewing me as a sex object and a woman. I go through phases in my life where I really embracing the crossdressing and buy beautiful clothes, and then I feel shame and throw them all away. I've done this for 25 years on and off and i'm now in a crossdressing phase and I want to just embrace it fully, but I'm worried that maybe I'm only doing it to get off, not to actually be a woman for real. All day I dream about having breasts and a pretty face, but is that just so I can feel sexy or do I really want to be a woman? Also, I have a wife who knows about my crossdressing but is totally opposed to any of it including even roleplaying in the bedroom. She is not supportive at all and actively discourages any of my crossdressing sexual urges in bed so I have to hide everything from her which makes me feel more shame and guilt. 

&#x200B;

I'd just like to know what my sexuality really is. Should I continue to hide my crossdressing and keep it hidden from my family or should I embrace my feminine side that tells me its ok to wear a dress to work?"	"I am a 30 year old woman. Born a woman, love living my life as a woman, but have been very turned on, sexually, by the idea of having a penis and having sex as a man for years. I've actually embraced this with my partner (33 year old man, cis 3.5 years together) and often will play that role, openly, with him. We both enjoy it, but I always feel some shame and confusion afterward. Now that we've done it a few times (I could go into explicit detail, but I don't know that that would be helpful) I really only ever imagine myself with a penis while engaging in most sex acts. I don't always tell him, but I think he might be able to tell... He tells me that he's into it, but I doubt him sometimes. I can't explain exactly why since he's never said he isn't into it and seems to get really turned on when I say certain things that turn me on (suck it, etc) I started this comment to tell you that you CAN find partners that are totally into you and what gets you off, but I find myself being really honest too, and just not truly knowing who I am at the same time. I've considered the possiblity of being a man inside. Am I trans? I have thought, many times that somehow, I'm a trans woman without my penis that I truly, truly want. I say this because I am very feminine. I wear makeup every day and love dressing nice. I love my curves and my hair and my face. I don't want to dress or look like a man. I only want the sex part. 

If nothing else, know you're not alone, and we may just be the strangest, most minority group of queers there is. But there is the two of us, and I'm sure more. 
sexuality is who you go to bed with, gender is who you go to bed as?
Ive never been straight, not once. However I was female for ages and hated every second and refused to be remotely feminine, thinking I was male, finally said screw it im trans. Im now living as a male and am pretty feminine. Sexuality is a very very very fluid thing we are trying to make fit into a ridged box. The key thing ive learned is happiness, screw the rest of it, just be happy. "	akk27w	trans	11	1.0	2019-01-28 04:55:19
Really depressed	"I feel like I am a broken inefficient person. I tried really hard for about a year to grow a social media presence. Put out tons of paid and free content just to try to get myself out there. I have seen all these cis and trans internet personalities and sexworkers grow these huge platforms, get surgeries and media coverage. I had my ex cheat on me with 5 guys, lost 2 jobs, was threatened with guns at the pizza place I worked, ended up homeless and jobless. Im barely surviving and I feel like just giving up. I'm way to radicalized to the left to ever work a normal job again and I just don't seem to have the ability to click with people online and I must be a billion layers of blacklisted and softblocked. It is sad to me that we live in such a vanity based and body shaming society still to the point that trans people like me who are ugly or stupid I guess, according to shitty cishet normative standards anyways and this toxicity leaked into the lgbt.. 

its painful to be a person who feels invisible as I know I actually am. All my effort feels like a waste and I'm probably logging out of this handle for good. Probably gonna disappear from social media alltogether. I feel some really bad feelings and am having really dark thoughts. I hope I can get through this but the temptation to drink is strong and I know it's all downhill from there."	"Sorry to hear about your story. Everything will be alright, those things that happening to your life will be replace by happiness, just believe in yourself, you can get back on your feet again, just take your time to heal, never give up, you can do it 💖
I'm sorry to hear that. I might not be able to comfort you much through the boundarys of a Reddit post, but i still have a few kind words for you to say \^\^  
From the limited knowledge you granted me about your history and your effords, i think that taking time off social media might not be such a bad idea. You seem very frustrated with yourself as well as the response you received through your social media presence. This is not a healthy situation. You don't see the success you aspire and blame yourself. You struggle to find a mindset you can feel comfortable with and - again - you blame yourself. If your circumstances lead you to loose confidence in yourself, grow frustrated and even desperate, it is time to limit the influence of the things that lead you to this point. Confidence is something you can only build up yourself. If you rely on other people to make you feel good, this feeling goes away, when these people leave. You need to find your own fire.  
As a trans person, you should be able to rememer the time, when you started exploring your identity to find out, what truely made you happy. Start exploring again \^\^ Reflect on what you need personally (not somethin materialistic) and how you can archieve it. Of course this is the point, where i tell you, that alkohol abuse will prevent you from this. Drinking is not the solution here. Thinking is. As always. \^\^  
You say, that ""it's all downhill from here"" but it is important, that you understand, that it is your choice to either work against that, or make it a self fulfilling prophecy.

With that said, i wish you all the best and the strengh you need to lift yourself up again.

Shame sucks, Be Proud!	"Hi all,
Just a (hopefully) brief rant.  
I spent 30+ years of my life hiding myself from everyone around me for fear they would find out my shame. 
Shame that I was not ""normal"", Shame that I enjoyed feminine things, shame that I wasn't a man inside.
Every day I buried myself a little deeper so that I could hide better.  I was so deep in the closet that I withheld my trans-ness from myself and by extension, my wife.  Hiding became my default and it tarnished my life and every relationship I've ever had.
My biggest regret about coming out is that I didn't do it decades ago.  
Shame keeps me hidden in my home.
Shame kept me from being myself.
Shame was taught to me by the world I grew up in.
I am so Proud to be a Trans-woman and I am so proud of everyone who has the strength to come out and be themselves!  Trans-femme, Trans-masc, Enbies and everyone living as themselves, you deserve to be proud of yourself.
So live your life without shame and Be Proud!"	Good for you HON!	nx2dbv	trans	8	0.84	2021-06-11 00:02:58
Ah crap. I knew all along :(	"I didn't start exploring my gender until my late 20s, and didn't fully accept who I was and start trasitioning until my mid 30s (and two years later I'm nowhere near finished).

I've always kinda gone that yeah, I realised things quite late in life, looking back I could see bits and pieces through my younger days that pointed to me being trans but never made any connections, and felt sad that I didn't realise these things when I was way younger, or had the courage to follow through on them immediately when I did start exploring them.

Then last night I was going through things in my head (imaginary arguments with your parents where you harshly lay out all the shit that you don't say in order to keep the peace. I'm sure I'm not the only one who does that) that made me think about things from when I was a kid and..

Shit.
I *did* know.
I've always known, right from primary school age.
Some of my earliest memories are trying ways to explore my gender when my parents weren't home (like trying on mum's things), learning better how to hide what I was doing so there were no signs when they got back.

I never had the words or framework to understand or express things properly, but even as a little kid I knew two things.

1) I was drawn to things that I was told were 'girls things', and girls were who I wanted to spend time with and socialise with and felt most comfortable around, and I neve felt comfortable or belonging around boys, even the very few who were my friends, and just assumed that was normal.

2) That what I was thinking was digusting, shameful, horrible things that if my parents (or anyone else) found out about they'd be disappointed and angry, and I could never tell them

I was never 'late to the party' with my gender identity, I've known it for longer than I've understood the word gender, I just crushed it into a tiny ball of pain and shame, so tight that I didn't really know where it came from, that I've carried around for my entire goddamn life because I knew my 'we love you no matter what and you can tell us anything' parents would hate me if I'd admitted it to them.

I have no clue where I'm going with any of this I'm just...
AAAAAAAAAARGH!!
*^%$$#$"	"Yeah. I’ve had a similar story, not really exploring gender until late 20s / 30s. I realized last night I’ve wanted to wear a bathing suit since I was a child.

It sucks but at least I have the assurance that this has always been a thing"	oxgqaj	trans	7	0.79	2021-08-04 00:22:08
Think I’m getting over my internalized transphobia	"My family is your sterotypical Latino catholic family, and because of that I was taught from a young age to feel shame. It’s something I’ve always struggled with, and the fact I was made to feel like I didn’t belong in gay spaces by certain transphobic gay men in the past really didn’t help. 

But I started dating a guy, and this whole time he’s treated me like his boyfriend, and it’s just really nice. He’s one of the only people who constantly calls me my preferred name, and will correct people. We’ve had discussions about the steps I’m going to take in the future to transition, and has only ever asked questions out of curiosity, not hate. 

Even though at first I felt very envious of him, and his lack of curves, he’s made me oddly more comfortable with my own by pointing out that cis men can also have curves (shocking revelation ik). Every time I don’t feel masc enough, he’s comforted me and told me I am."		wi33q2	trans	10	0.92	2022-08-07 01:01:06
It may be hard to believe but it actually does get better.	"This is a long and a bit rambling post. I'm not the best writer but I feel this is something I should share. Whether it helps anyone or not, I don't know. But I feel like I should at least try. For reference I am 31 MtF.

&#x200B;

I see a lot of guys and gals on here and other subs that are struggling with depression and acceptance. I see a lot of self hate, fear, and doubt as well. I've also seen a lot of post similar to this one telling you that ""things get better"" and to ""not give up hope"", and I, like many of you, never really bought into it. I never really believed that I could find the happiness and peace that others have told me about.

But... Today is different. At least for me anyways. 

&#x200B;

I have struggled with my gender identity for a very long time. I can remember cross dressing when I was 7 or 8 in my sisters cloths, always hiding it for fear of scorn or punishment from my parents. I remember in my early teens, denying my feelings as simply a fetish or phase but never truly believing it. I remember being in my 20's, living on my own. Finally able to explore my own emotions and desires. I started to experience the joy of living as my true self even if only in private.

 I like many of you, am from a very conservative part of the world. The bible rules the opinions and beliefs of most people around me, and they follow it without question or thought. Most of them never realize how that kind of blind devotion can lead to heartache for families or the community as a whole. 

A couple years ago my co-workers and I were driving back from lunch. One of us glimpsed something in the woods. We couldn't immediately identify it so out of curiosity we stopped to investigate. We walked down the hill to a small creek that ran perpendicular to the roadway. About 100 yards from the highway we found a young woman. She had hung herself in this secluded spot, from an old sycamore tree growing out of the bank of the creek. We brought her down and laid her at the base of the tree. We alerted the police and waited for them to arrive. Each of us gave our account of what we'd seen and how we'd found her and then we were allowed to leave. I later learned from a friend who worked with the local pd that she had been transgender and when she'd came out to her family they rebuked her. She then lost the last of her hope and took her own life.

 I can still see her face in my mind. I could tell she had been crying.  I wish I could have known. That I could have reached out and shown her that we don't have to be alone. Even when family lets us down. I know the fear she felt, and the sadness. I've felt her despair and nearly ended myself the same as she had. Even though we never met in life we were kindred spirits. Everyday I regret that I couldn't help her. We lived so near each other, and under such similar circumstances, but I was to late. Even though she's gone now, and even though I never even knew her name, she still made an impact on my life. I saw myself in her, and I keep her in my memories. I never knew her, but I love her.  

I started HRT the next year. I still felt the depression and the fear for the first few months. Only now with the estrogen driving it, I was no longer numb to the sadness. I could feel all my emotions fully for the first time and it nearly swept me away. Around 2 months in I had an argument with my father, I can't even remember what it was about but I left. I drove back to my own home and fumed the whole way, I was so angry and sad and tired all at once. I arrived home but I couldn't settle down. I was crying and screaming and shaking for hours. At some point I had gotten a gun out. I was ready to end it all but before I could I thought about her, and I couldn't continue. I didn't want to give up like she did. I realized that even though I hurt, I'd rather live. I drove back to my parents house, still a mess, still crying and screaming but, in search of help this time. I spilled my guts to them, I begged them for help and forgiveness. I told them how I'd been struggling and how I was at the end of my rope. Lucky for me they were understanding. They love me no matter who I choose to be.

I've since moved back in with them for the time being. They helped me find a psychologist and get the medical help I needed. More than anything my mom has just been there for me. We've since bonded in a way we never had when I was growing up.

It's now been 8 months since I started HRT. I just finished coming out to the last of my extended family. Every aunt, uncle and cousin know about the real me now. I've told them my story and they've listened. They don't know the whole story that I've written here, just the more pg bits. I never would have dreamt it a few years ago, but every one of them has been not only supportive but genuinely happy for me. I've heard every version of "" you have to do what makes you happy"" there is, from them. I know none of them truly understand what it means to be trans or how that experience shapes you but they're all willing to listen and learn. But I also remember that the support I've gotten from most of my family and friends is not something that everyone gets. I remember that I am very lucky to have people that care for me enough to put aside their own bias and beliefs to care for me no matter who I am.

Now a days I'm pretty well out of my depression. I can honestly say that I can't remember the last time I felt this happy and normal. For the first time in my life I can look into a mirror and not hate what I see. I haven't socially transitioned yet but the HRT is slowly doing it's work. My skin is softer now, my facial and body hair grow slower, my face has changed a little, my features are a little softer. I have breasts now and even if they are small they're there and I love them. More and more everyday I'm coming to love who I am and who I'm going to be.

I had never really understood pride until these last couple of months. I had only known shame for the longest time, but, as I've become more comfortable in my own skin and learned to love myself. I at last know what it means to be proud of who I am. It takes a lot of courage to transition, it's a scary thing to do in a world that seems hell bent on trying to put us down at every moment . But we can learn to accept ourselves and be proud of who we are. Our families and friends can learn to accept us and even be proud of us. But even if they can't. We can be proud of each other. We can make our own families with the people we choose. I for one, love every last one of you. I may have been to late to reach one of us, but that doesn't mean I will stop reaching out. If anyone ever needs to talk, whether it's about transition, family, friends, or anything else there is a community right here ready to listen. My dm's are always open and I would love nothing more than to help in anyway I can."	I want to comment something more meaningful, but you said it all so well!

I was outed to my ex-university classmates in Russia and it was disastrous.	"So, yeah, I was outed by a guy in my latest university, that I am trans. I was going by feminine pronouns in my university chat and was anonymous by the way, so nobody could spot me. Now everybody knows my deadname, and I feel enormous pain and shame.  


I have deleted the act of outing, as it gives me enormous pain. But you won't understand anything from this message anyways. I was saying goodbye to my university classmates this time, as I am leaving the university, and a guy just outed that I am trans.  


Devastation and pain. Glad that I was supported by a lot of people from my university <3

A short story about my life and my own gender perception.	"First of all, I want to ask pardon about my english. I’m not a native english speaker, neither a fluenty writer, so you are going to read a grammar hell. Sorry.

I was born in a rural town in Spain in 1982. I realised I perceive myself more-as-a-girl than as-a-boy when I was about 12 years, so I was in this rural place with some rural people who hit animals because they are bored, receiving a small dose of violence just for playing roleplaying games and getting high degrees in the school, so I didn’t talk to anyone about my… well, gender thing. Not a single person.

In 1995 I went to secondary education school in other town. Less rural, more “sleeping-city”. Full of skin heads, protected by the local police (direct family sometimes). My internal gender perception was more evident for me, but I NEVER thought about expresing it. I did live with shame, indeed. Anyway I fought to be a though guy. Martial arts, lifting weight, aerobics… those things are a important part of my life even today.

My father threw away of home my older sister, then threw me away, and then he was going to throw my mother too. I said “stop”, and protected her. My father divorced, and I returned to live with my mother, as she was terrified living alone. I had to assume the “man-of-the-house” role, and I hated it every day I did. But, well, my mother had some good years, and I had time to explore my artistic nature. While I did hide my gender identity in my interior, I wrote some novel about strong womans, strong with their swords or magical powers, the great womans that I would never be.

Anyway I was not strong enough to face the harsh spanish public, and neither to face the cancer, decadence and death of my mother. In 2019 my loving mother, the one I did care for years, died at my hands.

As my artistic nature was heavily touched (still it is), I began working at a management position at a multinational company. I don’t like that work at all, and was facing bad times with my relationship, and also my sister, a terf activist, began trying threw me out of the home of the mother she didn’t care. So I was at my workplace, waiting to my swordfighing classes time… thinking about my suicide like so-many-times in the last 20 years… and randomly thought “I want to hear odallus OST”. And I searched in youtube… and found a metal version. Well, I love Odallus and love metal, let’s see what this random-youtube-musician has done.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbEVSnIKccQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbEVSnIKccQ)

So I saw Katy Scary. That afternoon I looked lot of her videos. Then I went to swordfighting class, and then in home I looked more videos. She was cool, she was pretty, she had all the bravery I didn’t. I could be like her when I was her age (well, perhaps not so nice), and left the opportunity pass ahead of me.

In 2022 I was 40 years old. I did face my father when my mother needed. I did fight skin heads with my hands, faced the spanish harsh public when I did published books, and helped my mother to die when everything fails to her. I fight every week with a medieval sword against people who are younger and better than me. But I know I would never be as brave as Katy Scary, and you all, the people I see and respect at r/trans.

I will never be as brave, but, you know, a girl can always get some fun.

I did ask for help with trans people in my country, bought some new clothes, the clothes I always wanted to wear, and learned to make up. I’m, above all, a fighter, and I will not renounce to my place at weapons academy, even if somedays I want to cry when I hear some transphobic comments. I can’t neither renounce at my work at the multinational, as their dirty money has helped me in this way. My male expression is a part of myself, and some days, when I’m full shaved and look a little androgynous… well, I don’t hate me.

But nowadays I’m integrating my female expression on many aspects of my regular life, and its good. Well, still I hate my work, my sister is a transphobic terf who tries to get my out of my mother’s house, my mother is dead, my artistic nature is out, and I have little true relationships. But each day I get better with my sword, and I’m going to play all local warhammer tournamets as Valeria.

I just wanted to bring my (perhaps not so short?) story to r/trans.

Hi, everyone."	"Your story is amazing and you are such a strong woman! I can relate to some of your story. Reach out anytime I like to listen to my sisters. ❤️
Thanks, it's great to hear encouraging words from such an example as you are.

Always living with fear	"I've been staring at my computer for hours and wanting to post about my journey to coming out as trans. But I feel terrified and can't type. Same with commenting on other posts. I lock up and erase what I type. I hate myself for it. I'm afraid of people like some are afraid of spiders or heights. As a child wanting to play a girl in games or acting feminine brought scorn and guilt from family. Ridicule and harassment from other kids. Now in my 50's I still struggle with the guilt and shame heaped on me. I just came out recently to my wife and doctor. I have an appointment to speak with a doctor whose an expert in transgender care. She herself being transgender. I'm finally thinking of myself in terms of the woman I'm becoming. 

I want to share this and maybe help others with my story. But the fear of ridicule or being banned for (staring here I don't even know how to put what I want to say) .... for being me, I guess. I've erased this several times and rewrote it. I feel a bunch of negative things about myself. Even posting in Discord chat I feel fear of being mocked or worse being ignored. I don't want to sound pathetic, but I have no friends. No one I feel I can talk with. I believe if I reach out, I'll be bothering people. I'll be asked to go away. I'm over half a centry for crying out loud. Why can't I escape my childhood fears?"	"I'll be 40 at the end of this year, my trans journey officially started last September. We were raised in a very different time from many of those who post on here. The casual mocking, hatred, vilification, and dismissal of trans people has permeated society at a fundamental level and has only started to see improvement in these past 10 years or so.

It's near impossible to avoid internalizing this stigma. I remember that first month or two of realizing I am trans and the intense self hatred. It took time to process, it took affirming steps along the path, getting on HRT helped immensely. You start to love and accept yourself for who you are and you start to realize that the opinions of those decades of transphobes you've internalized don't fucking matter.


There's light at the end of the tunnel, and this road to self love isn't as long as you might fear.

Come join us on the r/trans discord server if you want to chat or vent. I'm Alexis on there.
Thank you. I've been finding people here are very supportive. I really appreciate your comment. I'm making small steps to get past my old fears. Seems silly how long it took me to jot down a few lines. The only reason I finally opened up and came out to my wife and doctor is a shift I've seen in the world around me. Yes the hate is still present, but people are ignoring it more. I came out to a couple coworkers and got positive feed back. They said outright ""Fuck em. Who cares what other people think. Do what makes you happy."" Still hard to feel safe internally. I can't wait to get to were I'm on HRT. 

I'll certainly give Discord another go. I'll try not to be so timid. I'm HottieKelly.
We have a bit of a process to get on the server. It might take a day or so to get approved, but hopefully you find a home there.

This is subjective, so my truth isnt necessarily yours, but dysphoria isn't worth living with. The overall improvement in happiness has been immeasurable, and I'm still boymoding. Albeit in like one of the most femme ways imaginable.

There's a reason we transition.
I'm actually on Discord already. I've just been too timid to post anything. 

I agree about dysphoria not being worth living with. I just recently bought breast forms and a pocket bra to hold them in place. As well as some comfortable women's underwear. I almost cried seeing myself looking mildly female. I know it's a long journey but I look forward to it. 

Again thank you. Hope your days are filled with love and light."	t1re7q	trans	8	0.9	2022-02-26 07:39:19
Family's weirded out by my new personality	"Hey all,

To retroact years of suppression I am now acting fully as myself, which is extremely ""feminine"" in a traditional sense wrapped in E-girl thigh high striped socks, yes I'm that basic. Anyway I know these members of my family really do love and support me, but they seem a bit weirded out by my personality. How I talk and my voice is radically different from boy-me. Now I'm kinda like an edgy Cat Valentine from Victorious. I know its just them getting used to it, but it really makes me feel shameful and excluded. I know its not their intention so I'm not holding it against them, but do things ever begin to feel normal again? Where I'm just me? DAE relate?"	"thigh highs are the way
I mean, a lot of us go through a phase of extreme femininity when starting to present how we want, and that can be a bit much. Eventually when we get confident in our femininity, it all mellows out a bit. I don't know if that's what is happening here. Either way, they'll get used to it with time, don't take it personally.
**ALTAR:**   
**AL-TAR - (noun) the table in a Christian church at which the bread and wine are consecrated in communion services.**  


**“Alters”  is short for ALTERNATE. These are the person's alternate personalities, when referring to separate personalities in terms of Dissociative Identity Disorder.**   


So, OP, Are you saying your family is freaking out because you made an ALTAR or because you discovered a new Alter?   


I'm just trying to understand. Also, altars are awesome. You can put bones and shiny crystals on them.
Totally this. 
I kept my femme side tamped down for like 30 years, and when she was finally let out it’s was like the gender equivalent of a dog with zoomies. Just so much femme everywhere. 

It’s been about a year and she’s gotten her exercise and settled into a much more balanced mode for my gender fluid self. She’s also started to be integrated much more fully into my personality. So much so that today I actually started thinking I might be more demigirl than gender fluid or maybe in addition to. I dunno. Gender is just weird. 

Also. I think it is an adjustment for family members. So long as they’re not being shitty about it. Something to keep in mind I guess."	xruet8	trans	8	1.0	2022-09-30 06:41:14
I’m starting to get it now	"
So yesterday I posted and commented on a hair transplant advice sub.  And was subjected to a bombardment of posts by men who had seen I am in fact a TrAnS woman and decided I must want to know all their toxic views and paranoia instead of get advice about hair transplants.

In the end I gave up and deleted.  I felt pretty weak for doing that.  I generally block and ignore but every notification I was getting would be another paranoid rant, from another stranger often talking amongst themselves and inviting each other’s phobic views like a gross little circle jerk on my post.  It was like I’d been caught running around and smacking people unawares with a magical gay stick and was being told off for it.   
But I just wanted to know if a hair transplant place was safe to use because their prices seemed too good. 

I still don’t know 🤷🏻‍♀️


This really got me thinking.
I’m a lefty snowflake through and through, I don’t tolerate racists, sexists, homophones, transphobes etc and haven’t since I was a kid.  
I was offended when I’d hear men = bad.  It was a case of echo chambers.   
In my naivety I knew this happens, but just felt perfectly normal to go onto a normal sub as myself. 
Now I’ve been bitten I’ll be being much more cautious and stealthy.  It’s such a shame.  People in our community need the strong ones to weather and bare the brunt of this kind of shit and calmly engage with and educate those out in the big wide world.

Maybe one day I’ll be strong enough to be an out and proud trans woman and advocate.   But for now I just want to disappear."		mc0l62	trans	7	0.9	2021-03-24 08:14:43

A Clocked Work Transwoman	"In the midst of my pre 29th birthday mania, I found myself headed towards CVS on behalf of my boyfriend who was having major low back pain. I was getting out of my soccer mom car when I saw a group of preteen to teenage boys heading into the CVS. I was completely unaware of what would happen next. 

As I walked towards the back end of the store I notice that same group of boys. It was then when I realized they were unaccompanied by an adult. This began to worry me. Because unaccompanied boys are ""traviesos"" or in english, trouble makers.  I also noticed at that point that all of their attention was on me. They spotted me but what would happen next? 

As transwomen we must always be hyper aware of our  surroundings. Or at least to a point. I need to personally work on chilling out from time to time. But safety is really so important. I can always tell when people are clocking me because I'm always aware of my surroundings. Sometimes I wish I wasn't so aware so that what I didn't know wouldn't hurt me. For some reason I was not too worried about this group of boys because they seemed young enough to not act so foolishly if they were to see someone they believe is trans. Too bad this was not the case. One of the boys was daring enough to blurt something out. 

As I was searching for what my boyfriend needed. The boys found their way to my vicinity. It was then when a couple of them decided to run through the aisle. One of them innocently joking about the pull-up diapers he was holding. But the rest of them not laughing. I overheard them carrying on their escapades in an aisle behind me. This is when the clock struck trans doom. One of them was about to say something that would sting so much and lead me on a spiral of depression. 

From my somewhat foggy short term memory of just yesterday I can remember one of them saying something just remotely offensive before the next boy followed suit with a very loud and clear clock. It also was the most gross and crude clock I have ever heard said about me. Okay here's it goes. This is what he said: ""is it just me or did she have a boner"" I instantly started to shake. Not only was he clocking me but pervertedly lying all for a laugh from his friends. Suprisingly I heard no laughter. I wanted so bad to say something back like a teacher or a neighbor would. But I stayed quiet and I am glad I did. 

Thanks to a post on reddit. I realized that staying oblivious and quiet is the best thing you can do. It makes them doubt themselves.

The boys passed by my aisle shortly after, heads down in what seemed like shame. One picked his head up and looked me straight in the eyes as if to say sorry. 

I think about this cisgender men who are man enough to admit their attraction towards transwomen. I am thankful for my boyfriend and think back to all the times he has shared his stories of having a thing for transwomen at such a very young age. I realize guys and even adult men still act the way they would have on the playground. And still what happened yesterday made me feel ugly, hurt and depressed. 

I used my 10 extra bucks at checkout to buy snacks that I hoped would bandaid my pain. Of course it won't. It will just make my digestion problems even worse. Anyway that was my experience and I'm calling it ""A Clocked Worked Transwomen"".


Ruby Flores"	"At the very least they knew they messed up... that was out of line, I would have looked them all to make it loud, clear, and embarrassingly known to them that is unacceptable especially in a public place!

Crazy how one sentence can tell me everything about your character and views	"I work retail and this lady speed walks up to me and says in the most annoyed and entitled voice I've ever heard ""Why aren't you playing Christmas music, I mean this doesn't put me in the mood for holiday shopping, like honestly this sounds kind of demonic!"" The song playing was ""What kind of Man"" by Florence and the Machine 🙃, like wow didnt know in 2022 we still thought rock was the work of the devil but okay? I know Karen's exist and so do inculcating Christians, but like God damn I've never seen someone scream both out to the world so quickly and without shame of who hears you.

I of course asked her how this sounded demonic, trying to hide any laughing in my voice over how absurd this situation was, to which she avoided by mumbling ""eh, I don't wanna get into that."" Like I don't understand what these people expect to happen.... I'm going to go in the back and switch it to jingle bell rock? I'm going to report to my regional manager that we gotta take that song off the playlist because it's inviting evil spirits in 🤣?  Idk I'm a pretty confident person, I pass well enough (esp with a mask in public), and im not terribly afraid of transphobes because of where I live, but alas, the whole interaction reminded me people with these views just live amongst me, thinking the world revolves around them and probably silently wishing I was dead... can't wait to see if someone will top her theatrics by the end of the holiday season lmao"	"Sorry I know this story is tangentially related to being trans but in the moment it very much made me starkly aware of my identity and how people silently view me, or at least trans people in general, and its an eerie feeling...
If Florence and the Machine is demonic, I really am a witch through and through. Lmfao. You know mindsets haven't changed much. I can't help but laugh at these people in their face."	ywdsjx	trans	9	0.8	2022-11-15 23:58:12
To those of us alone, or closeted this year, I wish you moments of joy over this holiday season	"It can be super hard to be alone at this time of year, whether physically alone, or emotionally alone inside. Carrying secrets, shame, or loneliness from isolation, can make a ""Merry Christmas"" or ""Happy Hanukkah"" feel hollow.

Whether you're 20+ years into transition, or living with a barely cracked egg, I want to say that I'm proud of you, and you should be too. It's taken a lot of bravery to come to this moment in your life, to stand where you are today.

Speaking as someone who's been at this for a chunk of time, let me say that time ***will*** heal many wounds. The hurts of this year will fade, some grudges will heal back into bridges, new friends and family will fill the spaces of those who can't see their way back to you.

There are many years of excitement, adventure, love and yes heartache ahead. But that's just life. I can not promise you an easy road, nor can I even promise you a well worn path. Some steps in life you'll have to take in the dark. But there's another, and another. Before you realize it, your life will be so different from what it is today.

Today I sit here, sleep deprived, wrapping presents and too much chocolate for my roommate. My family (both accepting and less-so) are no longer in this world. But I think about all of you out there.. your first holiday on your own, your first holiday self-aware, your first struggling holiday 'out', or your 26th, like mine.

Some of you will be blessed with family and friends who understand. Some may not. But trust me when I say to you, they will come one day. There will be people in your life who will like, love, and accept you for who you are... whether you've fully figured that out yet, or not.

So whether you're out and proud, or still in the closet, or being forced into AGAB clothes because Aunt Phyllis doesn't know yet... take a moment in the coming days, to watch the candlelight, listen to the music, look out the window, taste the food, etc. Embrace the moments that you find meaning in this holiday.

Because you've come through a lot to reach this point, and there's more to go. You deserve a moment or two of peace this holiday. Look for yours."		zufvn2	trans	7	0.9	2022-12-24 18:40:59
A love note to my body (What I'm grateful for this year)	"Dear body, I am so sorry for how I’ve treated you. I have been judgmental and critical and disrespectful. I have looked at you with disgust and shamed you for simply existing. I have neglected you and taken you for granted.  

And even though I have been cruel to you… you have never left my side. Throughout it all, you have always been right here… lifting me up, supporting me, and guiding me forward.  

I realize now that it is because of you that I get to run, dance, play and do all the things that bring me joy. It is because of you that I get to write, create art and make love. It is because of you that I get to be me.  

And even though sometimes being me is painful… I recognize that feeling pain at all is in itself a miracle. Depression, dysphoria, heartache, longing… all of this is a miracle. Because this is me, in a body… experiencing the exquisite miracle of life.  

And I realize that now. I realize that you are my gift. With all of your flaws and imperfections. All of your wrinkles and moles and scars. Your wide shoulders, big muscles and masculine features.  

All of this is beautiful. Because all of this is a magnificent tapestry of life.  

A life which is made possible by you, my dear body.  

Thank you, I love you.

Dont know what to do really depressed	"I really need some advice because i have the feeling im getting stuck at where i am.

I've always felt like im different from the others and couldn't find my own spot, i always dreamed about wakeing up as a girl the next day like nothing changed at all. I've always thought it will go away with time and it did for a couple of years, it came back when i hit 16 and i got really depressed, stopped school and everything went to a therapist and talked about her with my problem after that i didn't have the feelings of wanting to be a girl for a while but the last couple of months it came back after i stopped with my anti-depressants it came back stronger so i started to take them again. Im feeling like im holding back but it won't be gone forever and every day passes my chance of being happy passes by. I dont know what to do, i also have a girlfriend for 3 years now and she knows about my thoughts and always told me she would stay by my side no matter what happens but im too afraid to lose her and too afraid to tell her about my problem out of shame. Im almost 19 now and i feel like how longer i wait my chance of passing and being happy flies away. Some days i dont think about it and some days i do every minute so it confuses me if im trans or not or if i am just experiecing problems in my head..

Sorry if its bad english its not my first languege."	You are not the only person to feel this way!  Ask yourself what could you do today to feel more like yourself?

found a strong biass in news	"So i have been looking for a story any story of a cishat man standing up for a transgender friend. Now those are real they happen i know they do.  Because they happen to me and people i know.

If you feed it into google you get transgender people stand for themselves or transphobia if you feed it into duck duck go its abit better but you still dont get what i was looking for. 

This is probably because we are so god damm polarized and its a real shame. I heard one of those stories and it was very wholesome and cool but i cant get anymore because of algorithm biass.

Does Gender Dysphoria ever go away?	"I've felt a strong desire to be a women since I was at least 8. Possibly younger. It gets mixed in my head, I know the feelings became strongest after seeing porn and wanting to be the female instead of the male.   


I of course while acting on the feelings, also suppressed them quite often, feeling shame and fear as a child. Still I find myself every now and then wearing women's clothing and that strong desire, and often regret not trying to pursue it when I was a teenager. 

&#x200B;

I'll be 33 soon, I'm balding, I have a 3 year old beard, I'm covered head to toe in hair. I've grown to appreciate my appearance, and its masculinity but it almost feels like I'm held hostage by it. Fear of the unknown, and complacency in the known.   


Maybe not the best place to ask as many of you obviously have bravely taken that step but not really sure where else to ask for others who have struggled with this and are stuck in this duality.   


It is frustrating, I don't even know what I want, I Just hate this pang I feel. Most recently I've been playing a video game as a female character and the feeling has been exhilarating, looking down and just seeing nail polish on my hand, or wearing a skirt, etc.  


I want to say I probably experience this pang maybe 20% of the year? Most days go pretty smoothly but some days a part of me just screams."

Coming out to parents	"Hey y'all. I'm realizing that I really need to come out to my parents soon (nonbinary/mtf). I'm older, and more or less safe regardless of how my parents receive the information, but I'm deeply worried about disappointing my mom and pissing off my dad. 

There's alot of shame here that I have to learn how to manage first. I'm wondering if folks have any similar experiences and could share them. I'm looking for advice on how to go about this, and how to keep myself from avoiding it forever. 

♡"	"I'm in the same exact situation. Just starting transitioning and yet have to come out to my parents. I've been talking with my therapist about this and she has several ideas. If you have a therapist bring this up to them, if you don't try to find one it will help tremendously, now and in the future and just having a person to talk to who will truly listen to you is immeasurable.
Obviously everybody's experience is different. I have just gone through with this, and I can share. 

I originally wasn't going to come out of my folks. Then I decided to put it off until an indefinite time. But I'm getting married next year and don't want to spend my wedding having to hide who I am. I talked to my own therapist about making a plan, which for me was a long e-mail. Then I found a gender-affirming therapist in the region where they lived and got some local resources I could share with them. I wrote what I needed to say, read it over several times with my therapist, and sent it. The results weren't as catastrophic as I expected. They were shocked, but ultimately accepted this, and even mentioned they noticed signs when I was younger. This has led to a lot of awkward phone conversations with them, and while it has been emotionally taxing (I'm sure we all know how annoying it can be to have to explain your gender over and over), I'm glad it's out and resolving. 

The best advise the gender-affirming therapist gave me was to give them time. She said that up to a year could be needed, as to let them process while you set up your own safeguards and boundaries. If you're not seeing a therapist yet, now's probably a great time to do so. 

I dunno if any of this helps at all--but I have my fingers crossed for you. This is a hard, important step."	dpae4p	trans	10	0.86	2019-10-30 18:09:51
I feel like I am waking up	"TW: me better understanding how dysphoria effects me

So I had a really interesting thing happen to me that I noticed. Yesterday I had some unexpected time to present as myself (long story but my wife and I are working on her seeing me dressed as female). I had 4 hours to myself with no wife or kids. So I took the time to dress up in a cute flower top, gray cardigan, dark skinny jeans and a pair of black flats. I didn't have time to shave and do my makeup because I wanted more time to relax and work. I felt amazing. I felt attractive, this has been helped by the fact I am exercising and eating healthy, but also because I am really coming to terms with the fact I am transgender and making steps to become the woman I always wanted to be.

This attractive feeling felt great until I went to take a picture of myself and the illusion was shattered by the beard that was starting to come in since I hadn't shaved since Sunday morning. I still was riding the high of being me, so I decided to delete the pictures and continued getting dressed as a male to go work out before my wife got home. I said positive throughout the workout, pushing myself harder. Reminding myself that pushing myself will help get rid of my male fat placement before I start hormones. ""The pain is worth it Jessica"" is what I tell myself when I push that much more on my exercise bike. After my shower I slowly began getting upset. By the end of the night I was mentally drained, felt ugly and felt like shit. I woke up around 2am and I thought to myself. I felt ugly because I am a woman who grew a beard and saw herself in the mirror and it hurt.

I honestly feel great about this, and you may be asking why would this make me happy. I view it as liberating. I would have used this experience to shame myself back into burying this deep down like I used to. Now I look at it as one more piece of evidence I will tell my male self to persuade him it is time to let go.  It makes me happy to know that I have to do this for me. It helps me remove some walls I placed to ""protect myself"".  If I didn't get upset I might not be ready to transition.  

I need to take the negative things and reframe them to help myself fully understand why I have to do this. Being Jessica full time isn't an option and it makes happy to know I would get depressed to see myself in a beard while presenting as female, that's because I am a woman. Like Duh, why didn't I see this before. This for me fellow trans people and allies is how dysphoria effects me. Now lets use that anxiety and turn it into change. Time to hop on the exercise bike..."	"That's a great way of looking at things. It reminds me of the first time I tried makeup. It didn't go well, and I ended up crying and feeling stupid. My wife told me that it's something that just about every girl goes through. Now I feel kinda proud to have gone through the experience. Making the best of even the bad stuff is a great way of beating our anxiety. Rock on, Jessica!
Thanks, I 100% agree. I feel really good and journaling has been really helpful"	mhy0xo	trans	9	1.0	2021-04-01 15:42:27
lots of shame in being trans	"does anyone have tips in overcoming trans shame and general embarrassment? it’s really difficult. especially thinking about which family members would make fun of you or worse- 

and with partners- sometimes i feel like cis people have it so easy. i don’t look like a guy. more like a girl with a really masculine body and style. the thing is, if i’m interested in someone, how can i come out to them? how can i ask if they’d date a trans person? sometimes i get a little pessimistic about the subject even though i try not to. probably just a part of the shame- like something internal. but damn, lmao

I’m still young and i know i have all the time in the world- but again, damn"	"Honestly the best way too deal with this is time and finding activities that are gender affirming for you. I had a lot of thoughts like this shortly after realizing I was trans. I basically was extremely afraid to transition for the fear of being an ugly girl, not being able to have anyone romantically attracted to me, and being not accepted or judged by family members. Or worst of all, I’d come out to someone and they’d say something along the lines of “I accept you but this is going to be a big adjust for me.” I think I just overthink things and have issues from other mental disorders, but I felt like I was burdening them with my identity and that coming out made everyone else’s life hard. I dislike burdening people so I just got very depressed about being trans because of that. But over time, and with constantly experiencing dysphoria, I moved past thinking like that because I realized I’d never be happy if I didn’t transition. I accepted that it would be hard for the first year or two but after some work I’d be the woman I want to be and be much happier because of that. This is another suggestion but really do a deep dive into your life and realize the extent that dysphoria has negatively impacted you. You’ll probably realize that you miss out on a lot and find life really dull and drab because you don’t feel like who you want to be. Realizing that will help motivate your transition and put aside feelings of embarrassment. You’ll realize that while things as a trans person aren’t perfect, you’ll always be much happier after transitioning (whatever transitioning means to you ofc). Also, find little things that feel gender affirming and do them. For example, I listen to certain music now because it makes me feel very hyper-feminine. This is something little but it constantly makes me feel like the gender identity I want to be and makes me feel a lot happier about being trans. Little things like that will constantly remind you of how happy being your gender identity can make you and add joy to your life. I realize this is quite long now but I hope it helps✨
I know that having someone say ‘oh but don’t be ashamed!’ Is not useful, but it will get better. At some point you will get to the point you want, if that’s surgery, hormones or anything else. If your friends/potential partners don’t accept you for you, then that’s their loss. You honestly have nothing to be ashamed about, and I’m sorry I don’t have any actual advice.
Another thing that might help is finding trans role models. There's so many trans people absolutely killing it in the arts, the law, and all over right now, and I know personally for me, finding trans people I really respect and admire, both public figures and friends/mentors irl, really helped me accept myself.
thank you so much for your help!! i definitely see myself in your story, especially the parts about fearing you’ll be ugly post transition and the romance stuff. i don’t see a lot about that so i really appreciate your input! i don’t often experience intense physical dysphoria like some trans folks do, but i think i’ve come to realize dysphoria can be about more than that. (maybe?) i’ll definitely keep your advice in mind!
thank you, i appreciate that a lot 😭
oh thanks! that’s smart!
It definitely can be more than physical! I do get physical dysphoria. But I would say that’s only 50% of what causes it. A lot of my dysphoria was social. From a trans femme perspective, afab people (and trans women) have very close knit friendships. Being AMAB I didn’t have friendships like that. Even though I was fiends with mostly girls, because I was still perceived as A man I wasn’t as close as “the girls” are. At first I thought this was just me overthinking my friendships (like oh people don’t like me very much) but after a while I realized I wanted those very close, “girly” friendships that afab people had. And yeah basically that caused me a lot of depression and dysphoria because I didn’t feel like the women I wanted to be. But after coming out to my friends who are girls, they now treat me like a girl so I am just “one of the girls” because I am a girl. It’s honestly helped tremendously with dysphoria. I haven’t even started HRT yet and still present masc in public because I’m ✨scared✨but just having those girly friendships makes me feel so much more like the woman I want to be and helps me have confidence for my physical transition. You’re definitely not alone when it comes to having like psychological dysphoria. Even just being viewed as a girl by my friends now, I’m much less depressed than before.
Np man
that’s good to hear 😭 because i’ve always felt kind of like a poser because my physical dysphoria is not that brutal. i definitely agree with friends helping with the psychological dysphoria! one time my (girl) friends told me they almost asked me if i went in the wrong bathroom when i was going with them and i felt so euphoric honestly 😭😭 even though im afab with long hair and a large chest they still think of me as a guy and it’s really awesome! and i’m glad your friends were supportive when you came out! i definitely think the support helps a TONNN. the physical transition is still a little scary to me though- something about the realness of it all? i’m not sure. i mean i want to get top surgery and stuff but bottom surgery is kinda a bigger deal- and even starting T makes me a little nervous lmaooo😭 what about you?
I feel a lot of what you are saying. I mean mine had a weird religious component from my parents but this is all so familiar
no yeah some stuff with physical transition made makes me nervous too. i think i’m the opposite way though. i know transmasc transition stuff tends to be pretty fast and the changes are really quick and drastic. so that can be super overwhelming at first, even when they will eventually give you gender affirmation. trans fem stuff, mostly, tends to be the opposite. the changes are slower and less drastic at first. i’m going to to start hrt in the next few weeks and i’m extremely excited because i want all the changes associated with it (wider hips, a snatched waste, softer skin, softer hair, a more feminine face, less muscle mass, and maybe even biddies). but it doesn’t affect some things that still give dysphoria so i’m like what if it’s not enough and i need a bunch of surgery (i’m probably going to get a breast augmentation anyway) but stuff like facial feminization surgery and feminine voice surgery seem like a lot but i also want the changes associated with them so i see what you mean and know how you feel. at first even hrt scared me though, even though i really wanted it still, so i feel you. i guess it just took time where i had to realize the beautiful woman i can become with hrt and that’s who i want to be above anything. again friends definitely help though. like how you mentioned with using the restroom. i remember at a party (after i came out to my two besties) we all needed to go pee and waited in line. when it was out turn at first i was gonna just let them go but they were like “girl no come with us” and i finally felt like i got that stereotypical “girls all go to the bathroom together” social experience. so little things like that can help reaffirm your gender when you’re still nervous about accepting your trans identity or moving forward with it. your close friends are probably your highest asset when transitioning in the early stages. like my besties were like “omg lets teach you how to do make up if you want and lets go shopping on shein to help teach you about feminine clothes, and eventually lets go bra shopping.” stuff like that makes me feel like my physical transition is being reflected in how people treat me and how i see myself in the mirror. so it really helps. idk how it works exactly for transmasc people butttt little social support can definitely help, especially when you’re insecure. it also helps too when you want to experiment with presenting how you actually want. like for me at least yeah i’m not on hrt yet so i might not look exactly girly by myself. butttt if i’m wearing a skirt and a crop top with a group of 3 other girls people are much less likely to notice or say anything mean. idk if it works the opposite way but stuff like that can help too until you’re far enough along to consistently pass (assuming you want too, as you certainly don’t have to pass to be trans).
totally agree. it’s like 💀 do i keep my double D chest or do i knock it all off in a day- it’s definitely a very intense change. i can usually say i want top surgery, but when i wear my binder at school it’s sometimes…embarrassing? like- i feel as if i’d be liked more or be more comfortable if i just wore something regular and perhaps that’s sort of a “male gaze” thing? since i’m attracted to only men, maybe i subconsciously fear letting go of stereotypical men’s “wants”? (such as a large chest, feminine, submissive personality) but in reality i am quite masculine and would like to say i have more assertive traits. what’s funny is that when i’m around my friends or people who know i’m trans i feel great in binders. do you feel anything like that? 
i’m honestly kind of a strange case. despite my masculine build, i’m not passing at all. (not exactly my #1 goal) but it somehow makes only gay women be attracted to me- it’s honestly kind of funny imo😭😭 but kinda frustrating too. to be absolutely fair… i live in the south 💀not a lot of gay men to choose from. 
And aww that’s so sweet of them! ik that was probably so nice to hear! it seems like you have some really great friends like the bra thing?? that’ll be so exciting! and yeah- all the surgeries we could get😭😭 can cause serious anxiety. especially the costs and risk of failure- 
it sounds like you’re on a good path tho! (from what i can tell) and i hope it stays that way! i’m planning to start hrt at some point too but idk i guess i just come back to the fear of being outed at school (i mean- people would probably notice my voice changing) but yeahhhhh
and also, how did you (seemingly) overcome the feeling of “what if i’m ugly post transition?”

my bad i kinda rambled in this one 💀💀 but !"	uuqa07	trans	8	0.79	2022-05-21 16:10:41
Wanting to remain hidden	"Hello all,
I have had a hard time making this post or even considering doing this as opening up is very hard for me. I want to reach out and see if there are other people who feel like I do as I don’t currently have a community to talk/relate to. I am ftm trans pronouns he/him and I would like to stay a hidden trans person. Meaning I want to have the people who have known me pretransitioning to be the only people who know and just move on with my new identity as a man without it being known. There’s multiple reasons for this and my anxiety has me feeling so crazy to believe I may offend my own community as I want to maybe mask this part of me for shame? I don’t know but I truly don’t want to. I just have grown up in a household where I would feel less of a “real man” if the entire world knew my truth rather see me as a man and not treat me any different even if finding out I was born female. Are there any other people out here that can relate? If so what do you do to feel better in this world? Do you feel guilty? Do you have constant anxiety like me that the way you talk or act or feel about topics will reveal your truth and the whole world will know you were born different than what you are and then treat you weird? A lot of me hates myself for wanting to hide, but a lot of myself finds comfort in keeping it to myself and allowing myself to flourish in my “new” life as a man. Is it “wrong” to view it that way? I constantly walk down the street or just give my coffee order and it feels like people staring in my eyes just “know”. It has put my social anxiety into even more of an extremity than it already was and I just want help. Thank you"	"What you're describing is a desire to go ""stealth"", where you present as a person of your actual gender without disclosing that you are trans. It's a perfectly valid way to transition, and many people do so for safety and comfort. Nothing to be ashamed of.  

If you suspect it might be due to internalised transphobia, then by all means, do some self reflection. Spend time in trans positive spaces for a bit and then ask yourself if you'd still like to go stealth. If you do, that's fine. If you don't anymore, that's also fine"	sc5idd	trans	7	0.9	2022-01-25 04:52:50
Coming out to my parents??	"hey folks. I want to preface this by saying that I KNOW how cliché it is to come out during pride month. but I’ve always liked the idea of being able to come out during a month in which my identity can be celebrated, and I can be proud to be who I am. 

in the last few years, I’ve explored my gender and sexuality. I’m 22 now, and just this last year I settled on my identity: non-binary transmasc, they/he pronouns. it was easy to come out to my friends and have them tell their parents and other friends just so everyone knew and could respect who I am. I like to cover all the bases because it saves me energy.

but this whole time, I’ve been hiding myself from my parents. I still go around as their daughter, using my given name, and basically putting on a show. but lately, the lines have started to blur. I go by my chosen name almost everywhere. at my new job, everyone addresses me by my chosen name and they know that I’m trans. but I’m so scared to come out to my parents, the thought alone makes me feel sick and like I’m going to cry. 

when I was in 8th grade, I came out to them as pansexual. they weren’t very understanding and made jokes about it, said “isn’t that just bisexual?”, asked if every girl friend that I had was my girlfriend, and got suspicious when I’d spent the night with girls. I felt almost predatory because of them, when that wasn’t who I was at all. eventually, sometime in high school, they thought I was lying about my sexuality. I wasn’t actually bi. so I went with it because I was tired of the shame and the discomfort they made me feel. I never felt accepted for who I was, and the girlfriends I had were kept a secret. 

since then, my parents have done a considerable amount of soul searching and have realized a lot of things they did and said were not okay. I’ve forgiven them and I understand that people can change. but I do not know how my parents feel about the transgender community. I don’t know if they’ll ridicule me or tell me I’m lying. I don’t know if they’ll respect me and call me by my new name, or if they’ll be angry or hurt or confused. I also plan on just telling them that I’m trans, FTM, because they’re old school and don’t know what non-binary means and I don’t feel like explaining it to them. it’ll be enough to have them understand that I’m just not a girl (I haven’t even started transitioning yet, so I’m worried they’ll use it to invalidate me. I don’t think they’ll do anything cruel like that at all, but I’m genuinely just expecting the worst).

I know what everyone’s going to say, if they don’t accept me for who I am then fuck em. but they’re all I have. I can’t come out to my grandma, and besides the 3 of them, I barely have contact with the rest of our family. I lost my mom when I was 9 years old and I would do anything to make sure I have a good relationship with my dad and my step mom. again, they’re all the family I really have. I don’t want to come out to my parents if it means that they won’t look at me the same. I’d rather wear my disguise forever, and pretend to be somebody that I’m not, if it means I can have parents. 

I don’t know how I’m gonna do it, what I’m gonna say, or when I’m even going to do it. I want to do it as soon as I can, but I’m scared to death. part of me wants to send it in a text and just explain that I’m too afraid to say it to their faces. but I know I need to man up and say it in person. I’m gonna bring my boyfriend mostly for support, and if things get uncomfortable then his presence might ease the tension. 

basically all I’m asking is, if you’re out to your parents, how’d you tell them? when did you tell them? how’d they react? any advice is welcome, feel free to say as much as you want or need to. I just want to be able to live one normal life, I’m tired of feeling like I have 2 identities. 


tl;dr: the thought of coming out to my parents has me shitting myself and i don’t know how to approach the situation."	"My advice, if you feel like you are living a double life and this is negatively impacting how you view yourself, you should come out to your parents. It seems like a good sign that they are able to do soul searching and regret criticizing your sexuality in the past. Hopefully they will be able to do the same with you telling them you are trans. It is entirely up to you how much is said, and if you feel like they won't understand the non binary identification then go with whatever makes the interaction more comfortable and true for you, not just your parents.

Having someone supportive with you like your boyfriend is a great idea. If it gets overwhelming or you get reactions you were not hoping for, you can always stop the interaction at any point. If they pressure you as to why you feel the way you do or start reacting negatively then you can leave and explain later. Over text is much easier for this since in person social interaction can sometimes be much more stressful.

I personally had enough evidence that my parent and siblings would not react too negatively to me coming out, which made it easier when I did. The way I went about doing this was not the typical way I guess. I basically gathered everyone in the household into one room one night and just said my name and pronouns. Didn't really stick around to explain myself. I just went and hid at my computer the rest of the night. Explained more the following weeks as I felt comfortable to do so.

If and when you decide to tell your parents, I hope it goes well! You got this!"	nvlhvm	trans	6	0.76	2021-06-09 02:52:11
I read all these posts and stories about trans-affirming parents, or parents who support gender-questioning kids, and I cry. . .because I wonder how my life would have been different if I had parents like that	"Since I was little, I never quite fit in with the boys.  I got called ""sissy"" and ""gay"" and ""queer"" and ""fag"" and every other slur imaginable as a kid (which always confused the heck out of me, because I like girls).  I eventually learned to emulate the ""right"" way to be to reduce the taunting.

At the same time, I preferred to hang out with the girls and wanted to dress like them.  I remember feeling profound envy the first time the boobie fairy visited a classmate and she showed up the first day of school after blossoming during the summer.  I saw her boobs and wished I had those on my chest, I could make out the straps of her training bra, and wished I had one too.  

I had fantasies my whole childhood about my parents ""having"" to raise me as a girl for one reason or another (my favorite was some long-lost rich relative wanting to leave his fortune to my parents daughter, so they have to convince him that I'm their daughter and raise me as such so we could inherit a huge fortune), or of some horrible accident destroying my genitalia (constant castration fantasies, I hate having those ugly bumps between my legs).

. . .but I knew enough to not say any anything about any of it.  I picked up enough to know that most other boys didn't think these things, and that my parents didn't approve.

When I finally worked up the nerve to come out to my mother, when I was 20 years old an in college, it went miserably.  My mother was sure that if I came out to anyone else I'd lose everything.  She was insistent that I'd be kicked out of college (a major state university) because ""no school wants a pervert going to it!!"", that I'd be permanently unemployable and ""you wouldn't even be able to get a job digging ditches or scrubbing toilets!"" that all my friends would leave me, that my roommate would move out and stick me with the whole rent for our apartment, that my father would disown me (okay, that was probably realistic).  Also, she couldn't understand the difference between being trans and being gay.  As I told her I thought I was a girl in a boy's body, her response was ""are you trying to tell me you're gay?"", and it went downhill from there.

She begged me to take it all back, and I did, I never talked to her about it again.  It was clear that for all her babbling when I was growing up about tolerance and acceptance, her vague remarks that were LBGT positive, her ""you can always come to me about anything"" and ""I know you better than you know yourself, you can tell me anything and it's okay"". . .that was definitely not okay to talk to her about and she didn't see it coming.  She wanted me to marry some rich socialite and have a political career, which was totally incompatible with being transgender. . .especially in the 1990's.  Her aspirations for me were unrealistic, but she tried hard to force them on me.

(My mother did apparently try to out me to my dad during their divorce, when I refused to take my mother's side during the divorce and was trying to be neutral.  A few years after the divorce my dad said ""Your mother even tried to claim you were a gay crossdresser!  She made up all kinds of wild lies about you!"")

So, for various reasons I've had to live in the closet for 20+ years.  

. . .and I read stories of now how parents are so different, about how kids come out to their parents as gender questioning and moms taking their AMAB children out to buy their first bra or dress without a fuss. . .and it makes me cry.

I'm so happy for those kids, so happy that they can come out to their parents without fear or shame.

I'm so happy that kids that are questioning their gender can do so openly.

I'm so happy that so many parents accept it when their kids say they think they might be a girl or a boy.

. . .and I'm so sad I never got to experience that.  So sad my mom never got to take me bra shopping, or to go shopping for a nice dress, or have some nice mom-daughter time.  Instead, I had to furtively go shopping on my own in college, and deal with a hateful, spiteful, salesclerk that called me a ""pervert"" and threw me out of the store when they realized I was shopping for myself (a trauma that basically made me too anxious to ever shop for myself again).  I had to learn to order everything online and just make educated guesses about sizes.  I had to learn to hide things from roommates.

Even when I had friends who supposedly accepted me, I realized they were only accepting me as a crossdressing male, never as a girl.  They didn't mind if I was dressed as a girl, but the women of my social circle never accepted me as one of the girls.  I was just happy to have SOME acceptance, and I know the world was different 20+ years ago, but I just wished my college-era friends had seen me as a girl.

I'm happy for what so many kids have these days, and I'm more than a little envious, and sad that I never got that."	"I’m so sorry you had to go through all that 😞
Same they make me so jealous. Everything is so hard because my parents aren't supportive
I understand and feel your pain.  I was a teen in the 80's and heard the same slurs from my father. Didn't know what trans was since there was no internet or way to easily connect to others like myself. I joined the US Air Force in 1990 when being LGBT was against regulations (military illegal). Figured out I was trans in my 30's then spending the next 10+ years in denial and didn't come out to my adult children and my wife until I was 50. Still haven't come out to my parents or siblings.
Yeah, I'm 30 and just started my transition. The gender swap and child filter on faceapp left me crying my eyes out. Just the thought of how I would look as a young girl and how I will never get the chance to be her makes me cry."	zv476e	trans	8	1.0	2022-12-25 19:00:47
FTM: Do you get/have you gotten “you’re so pretty/you have such a great body, don’t ruin it, what you’re doing is a waste/horrible”?	"Do you get/have you gotten “you’re so pretty/you have such a great body, don’t ruin it, what you’re doing is a waste/awful”?

I’m sorry if I’m posting too much. I already posted this morning but talking to people about this is so new and amazing to me. I just came out to myself (well, for the second time. Did it a decade ago and retracted and repressed it with shame) and found this sub a week ago. I posted this also in a community specifically for FTM just FYI if you see it twice lol. Want to hear from as many as possible. 

I have a very feminine, pretty much Barbie body. The breasts and wide hips, small waist, and even the thigh gap that has her still thin while well-endowed. Without even exercising. And it just makes it so much worse. I was talking to my friend who worded it perfectly: “when you have what so many people want, it’s hard to allow yourself to want something else.” I don’t think so, but I’ve been told I have a pretty face too. And most women would be so happy but I don’t want any of it, it means nothing to me but suffocation. It feels wrong, like there’s something wrong with me that I don’t want it. At the same time, I look at my curves and multiple times a day unconsciously always automatically try and push them in so they go away. But it’s extra wrong for me to “ruin” my body and apparently I’m gonna miss all the male attention, even though some of it includes sexual harassment, and I’m going to regret it and can’t take it back when I ruin my face and body and I’m lucky to look like this."	"MtF, not FtM, but I've literally got exactlly this but in reverse. Broad shoulders, lots of muscles, good hight, and enough hair to pass as an ape. I mean, my step dad always goes on about it, even though I'm battling the uk system to start hrt. Even a bunch of people in my old school kept saying the same thing when they found out. Do what you feel comfortable with. They're not experiencing the pain and suffering of gender disphoria, so why should they act like they understand what it's like?

She found my bra and was worried I was cheating on her, so I had to come clean.

She told me I ruined her life.  I feel so much guilt and shame.  Shame for hiding it from her.  Shame because I’ve been repressing the core of me.  I’m so worried I’ll lose my soul mate, and my kids will hate me.

I wasn’t ready to come out, but now that someone knows there’s a tsunami of emotions and things I’m having to admit to myself.

Holy shit this sucks."	"First: you are REALLY VALID!! There are people who care about you and you bring something great to this world, in one way or another. I don't have to know you personally to know that's true.

I'm really sorry that her reaction was so toxic but I think it's a good explanation of why you feel shame about it. If you were hiding it from her it's because you probably already knew it wouldn't go well. Don't let her feelings damage yours though. You didn't harm her in any way. If she hurts it's because she hurt herself. You are trying to be the truest form of you and there's no shame in that. Being happy is allowed and encouraged so make HER explain what's not ok. On top of that, she's the only one who could ruin her life with this new information. It's not harmful to her unless she weaponizes it. She needs to get her shit together and you both need to see therapists. But in the mean time she needs to apologize to you. You've been exploring a part of you that doesn't harm anyone and makes you feel complete, and only behind closed doors. This is not the end of the world for any of you. Now is the time to discuss and really try to understand each other. It can be done but it's going to take work.

Also, kids are surprisingly adaptable. If you're a good 'dad', you'll be a good 'mom', if you decide that's where your journey takes you. Older kids MIGHT be tougher or take longer but little ones are easy. They mostly don't have any fucks to give about what clothes you wear or how you look. And when they get older they'll be better people as a result of it. More caring and accepting, better advocates, just better people all around. All good things. Can't promise it'll be easy or smooth but the sun will still rise, you'll still have children that need your love and support, and you'll still be valid. A real person with real feelings that can't be refuted. Don't let the hurt get in the way of meditated decision making.
Thank you.  I’m a mess.  I’m trying to take things minute by minute, hour by hour.   Complicating things, I’m in a career where “psychological help” / “counseling” is still very stigmatized and is a career ender.  

Things have calmed down slightly, and I am grateful that she says still loves me.  Unfortunately, it’s very clear that if I pursue anything, it’s over.  I’ve always been scared of expressing this side of me for fear of rejection.   I really feel I’ve fucked up by not expressing these things earlier, but honestly I don’t think I was ready to confront this at all, even though I’ve known for nearly all my life…well, as far back as I have memories.

I have no fucking clue what to do next or where I can ask for help."	pd1rtp	trans	10	0.91	2021-08-28 02:47:03
Does anyone else feel as if it's hard to be honest about their true gender identity, even while being accepted?	"Basically I started identifying as a trans man when I was 13/14 and because of negative influences around me (the only trans friends I had were very adamant that I  needed to have surgery and to, for lack of a better words, hate my body in order to 'qualify' as a trans man), I went back to presenting as cis while still being masc-leaning at heart. Since then I've come full circle and revolved around the  nonbinary, trans man, demigirl, and agender labels with masc-leaning agender being something I've closely identified with over the past couple of years.

However, even with trans people who accept and are close to me now, I still feel the inherent urge to either lash out to defend my 'transness' or stifle that part of me because I am not easily recognisable as a trans person in the aspect that I do pass as cis both because I have transphobic family and because I'm comfortable with the way I look. It makes it very hard for me to befriend binary trans people, let alone trust them with my gender identity, because of my past experiences being gaslighted and shamed for my own.

I am a relatively private person and I don't like admitting my internal struggles to people but this is something that's been an issue for me for roughly the past three or four years and I honestly just feel awful for it. Is this a common occurrence? Has anyone else here experienced something similar?  I really just needed to get this off my chest."		qofzde	trans	8	1.0	2021-11-07 03:16:34
Trans partner's discomfiting request - advice/insight?	"I hope this is the right place to ask for this advice - im sorry it's so long, I hope at least some folks can read it and let me know what they think and if there are perspectives im missing here.

I'm a cis woman, in a relationship for the past year with my transfemme genderqueer partner. They came out as trans not long before we got together (we had already been friends for a few years), and has since been presenting very femme.

 A few months ago they decided to start hormones - but given the rubbish state of gender clinics here they got some estrogen from an older trans lady friend of ours (who is a general badass and kind of guide for younger trans folks in our scene) and more was to be procured online, along with anti-androgens, as a more steady supply and a higher dose. After just over 2 months on hormones (which they were feeling great about!) they ran out and customs issues have delayed more... It's now been almost a month since they've taken estrogen, and they're feeling shit about it. I know they'd been excited for the weather getting better and feeling more like dressing cute and stuff as their body changed, and they feel like that isn't going to happen, that they're backsliding and it'll soon be as if they never started at all. Coupled with their existing depression, and issues with their parents being unaccepting, this has had a bad effect on their mental health.

It was a rare sunny day today, and I woke and got up to find our housemates all in the mood to sit in our garden drinking tea. Knowing my partners insomnia and depression means sometimes they'll sleep through a fun buzz and feel shit about it later, I popped in to them in our room to see if they wanted to join us - bad call - I hadn't realised that they've actually gotten so low that they didn't want to be woken or awake (or alive really,tbh :( ) at all and have since been sitting in bed feeling like crap. I felt terrible about having woken them - and about how low they are generally.

As I said, it's warm, so I've been in shorts and a bikini top hanging about and doing things around the house, and have been also in and out to hang with them and see how they are doing.

I was making some food in the kitchen when I got a Facebook message from them - asking if I could wear something other than my bikini around them today as it was making them feel jealous and shit about their body. I said ok, and am now wearing a tshirt.

....but I am feeling *really* uneasy about the whole thing. I'm not going to raise it with my partner now - they're feeling so horrid and I don't want to add to that - people also don't tend to be their best most receptive selves when super duper low, so I don't think it would be productive from an ""us vs the problem"" standpoint anyway. I'm also not sure if this even is the problem I feel it might be - I'm hoping for some clarity here.

I wanted to field some thoughts from trans folks, particularly transfemme folks, about the whole thing, and gather my thoughts. The thought that me being around my partner dressed in very little makes them feel horrible about their own (beautiful!) body breaks my heart - and the idea of them having to sit there feeling that way if they want my company when they're down is an awful one.... But like I said, it feels weird, and wrong. I'm well aware that it isn't *at alllll* coming from the same place as the impetus on women to cover because of the lustful gaze of men - but feeling like I should be covering my body because of anybody else's reaction to it, whatever it may be and wherever it may come from, is a profoundly discomfiting one.

I'm trying really hard to be understanding. I'm totally open to the possibility that there's an element to this that I'm currently not seeing because I'm cis and my relationship to my gender and body is so different from theirs in this world, or because of my own emotional reaction to the idea of changing what I wear to suit somebody else(which I've only ever before encountered in the other form, the 'don't be slutty' 'cover your shame' form, so have a knee jerk defence reaction to)

I have no clear ideas here, and no good answers. And it sucks. What do you all think?"	"[deleted]
It's hot. Wear what you want. They'll have to deal.

I guess mine is harsher advice, but I've been on the hormone waitlist since last July and might not get started for another month. I understand fully how shit it is. But no way in hell would I ask someone else to dress differently to make me feel better. There have got to be other ways to help them feel better beyond how you're presenting. Sometimes I just don't get other trans people, I would never consider that request on my partner.
Hey folks, thanks so much for commenting.

I thought about all of your posts, and had a chat with my partner the next day.

During our conversation they said it was much more about seeing me in the cutesy summery clothes they felt they couldn't wear than seeing my body, breasts etc.... they were pretty disappointed that it was something that was a big enough deal for me to have a conversation with them about it - they said that previously when they felt this way they could just hide away, but we share a room, and should they just have told me to stay away, etc etc. I talked about how I'd received their message, looked down at myself and felt 'aware' of my breasts and body in that uncomfortable way I've tried to spend ages sloughing off. I don't think they really rated that as an important feeling to be honest, since they basically said it 'must be nice for me to not be constantly aware of my body'....when it wasn't like I was comparing how I was feeling to the feelings they have... and when I honestly don't think that me just being around them dressing how I want evoking that feeling in them is the same thing as them then making a request of me that evokes that feeling in me.

We didn't fight or anything - but I don't think either of us came away from it feeling particularly differently than we did before we spoke..... I still want to be understanding of their feelings, but want them to understand how weird it felt for me to be asked to change what I was wearing in that way. They basically left it in a place where they 'just won't ask me again', but I don't think we really reached an accord of any description... I made it clear that it wasn't that I was saying 'never ask again' - but I wanted them to understand that it isn't a nothing request to ask me to change what I'm wearing around them.... I don't think they really agreed to be honest, and expressed disappointment that they could ask this one small thing once in the context of a year long relationship where they've never asked anything even remotely like this of me before, and that I'd feel such a need to talk to them about it - when I approached them asking if we could speak about the other day that wasn't at allll what they were expecting me to want to talk about like.

I guess sometimes this is just how a relationship issue ends up getting resolved... sometimes an accord isn't reached, and neither person is particularly satisfied with the outcome, but you both move on anyway since the alternative is duking it out endlessly until one person or the other agrees. Maybe this outcome is just going to have to be good enough.

Thanks again to everybody who commented. I'm really glad I could process out these thoughts and feelings first - its a fraught subject and bringing it up with my partner when I was having the feelings about it would probably have ended in disaster.
Transman chiming in here, but eff all that noise.  Your partner doesn't get to police your body or how you dress it.
I think you're just going to have to get over it. Your partner isn't a man, and they aren't asking you to do this because of you or how they feel about your body. They are asking you to do this because of how *they* feel about *their* body. Every trans person relates to their bodies differently, and right now it sounds like your partner hates theirs. Idk what they were like before, but right now with the cessation of the physical and (crucially!) emotional changes that being on HRT causes, their relationship with with their body is at an all time low. 

I understand why you are uncomfortable. But what you need to understand is that your discomfort has to be weighed against the torment your partner is going through right now. 
If wearing a shirt around them while they're going through a dysphoric episode is all you have to do to make them feel less awful, then you should really have no issues doing so.  
Being off hormones is hard. Tell them they are pretty and encourage them to put on a bikini and lay out so they can have cute tan lines for you.
Woah that analogy was *really* effective, and your whole comment has really given me pause.

They and I often talk about reasonable and unreasonable expectations and requests...not specifically about gender stuff even, just generally - we're anarchists and we try to have a committed relationship while trying to decouple that from the entitlements and power dynamics often accepted in normative relationships - and often land in the space where we figure that there are some things that might be uncool or unhealthy or whatever in a situation where they were a pattern or the accepted way of being, but that as imperfect queers with past shit relationships navigating a brutally fucked up world we're probably going to have to push up against one another's discomfort sometimes and have to be able to allow some space for that too.

I'm hoping the hormones situation gets sorted out soon - there are some options on the horizon and I'm sure we can figure it out. Our older trans lady friend has invited them over to hang out (she's basically like Trans Mom Superstar lol - and one of my closest friends too) and I'm fairly certain once she sees the weight of how they're feeling she will find *some* way to get them a stop-gap supply... Fingers crossed!!

Thanks so much for commenting x
Its a good thing you tried to talk about it at least. Trans guy here. I get where your partner is coming from. There have been time I have been jealous of cis guys beards/body and wanted to *be* them so badly. As well as seeing the cloths and just wishing I could pull it off. The baby analogy in the top comment is perfect. Obviously there are going to be those types of emotions there but there is certainly a level of tolerance ideally. Its not your fault you have the body / style you do. Really a lot of this is us comparing ourselves to cispeople and having to get over our own internalized criticisms.

However it would have been be ridiculous to ask my [now ex] partner to shave their face just becasue i wish i had their beard. I get your feelings too and they are more than valid. I remember when I wasn't out yet I was forced into a push up bra against my will because it would be ""more attractive"" by a cis guy. People do act like they have a right to your body when your conventionally viewed as female. Either by telling you to show off or to cover up becasue men can't keep it in their pants otherwise *eye roll*. Eventually your partner may get a hold of their dysphoria but if this gets worse and they start making these requests frequently rather than dealing with the root of the issue directly then you may need to consider yourself first. 
I understand. The weighting of their experiences is something I agree with - which is why I didn't talk about these feelings with them - we both have really different experiences of gender based oppression (and I've never experienced depression), and I try to be cognisant of the fact that there are huge parts of what they go through I'll never ever ""get"".

I wasn't mentioning covering for men because I think it has anything to do with that, or that my partner is a man - quite the opposite, as I said. I just haven't ever experienced a request to cover that was not that - and I wanted it to be clear that I'm aware that my emotional reaction to them asking me that could be seriously coloured by a lifetime of that thing..... And it seems from your response that this might indeed be the case.

Thanks so much for responding. I really appreciate it."	4lldda	trans	7	0.83	2016-05-29 17:39:47
horrible shame about being trans	I am trans, and 17. i think i’ve always had somewhat of an inferiority complex, which i realized because of my boyfriend pointing it out. but i feel such guilt and shame about being trans, i feel bad for coming out and changing so much since then. my boyfriend and friends reassure me and tell me they love me no matter what, but it feels too good to be true. i don’t know how to overcome this	"You have to learn to love and truly see yourself. But you will have moments of doubt. Stay strong and be authentic.
It's hard to ignore the tsunami of TERFs in and out of politics currently. But you shouldn't be ashamed of being Trans. I have to remind myself that there's people who love me for being me and fuck everyone else. The more you continue to transition the closer to being your true self you become. But I'm not going to lie the amount of people on Trans social media having a crap time, and looking at the shit in the news can really do a number on your head.

I'm trying to kick this addiction to looking at the crap that's around and try and focus on my own life safe in the knowledge that the people that know me, love me and that's what matters.

If you ever need to DM me for advice or to vent I'm happy to talk and answer questions."	utnhcv	trans	7	0.89	2022-05-20 06:59:04
How am i going with my transexuality	"(Don't care if i write something wrong, i'm not a native English speaker)

I'm MtF 15y, and started to question my identity when I was 14, however, thoughts related to transexuality started between mid-12 to 13. Since I finally decided who i am, i told my mom and sister, my sister completely understood my situation, but my mom was confused about all that stuff. And, well, about my dad, it was a shame for me... he wasn't happy about my decision and told me that he would never support me, and after this I didn't get any contact of him. I felt I lost my dad (he stills pay the alimony, but don't even visit me), and in my heart i feel like that i am a pure mistake... he always told me that he was waiting for me, the first man in his family, but when i changed the storyline, all of my relationship with him got in vain.  


On my house, well, i get bothered because my mom and sister refers to me as he/him, i don't get upset on them but i feel i'm not being comprehended, but i understand it, they lived with me all the time so they got used to that.  


On my school, at least, everyone supports me, and refers to me as she/her, obviously have people that don't know about who i am, but i don't even care, it's not their fault.  


Despite what i said, i changed my name! (not on my documents, but still have changed) And now i can buy clothes  that, on my perspective, are feminine, and that's awesome, i look very great on them. I'm happy with all my changes, i feel good with myself after all my depression situation (i still have it, but now i kinda can control my feelings), i have anxiety when i get misunderstood, but it is temporary.  


Well, that's it. Thank you for the attention, and see y'all later. ;)"	"It sounds like you are doing well to me!

It's unfortunate about your father, maybe time will change, and he will support it eventually.

About your mother/sister using he/him, just try to remind them every once in a while that you prefer she/her pronouns. Don't be aggressive about it, but little reminders over time should help them understand your preference.

I'm glad you are finding yourself, congrats! 💖


* Off topic, ""transition"" is the word used for this process. So a more accurate way to write the title would be ""How am I doing with my transition"".

I know you said you don't care if you write it wrong, but it's ok. Your English is understandable.
Yeah, i'm not aggressive, i just try to give signals of that; oh, i see, sometimes i don't acknowledge the wrong terms, i'm not in these things of terms, so i only know some things; no, i mean that you (the readers) could not bother if i write something wrong, but thank you
Oh! I understand now."	uskux1	trans	8	0.83	2022-05-18 19:35:15
I transitioned a decade ago and I still feel like a fraud	"I'm a trans woman in my mid-30s who came out about ten years ago. For the last five or six years, I've felt awful about being trans. Some of this is just the political atmosphere, I guess, but also the early pride and defiance I felt when I first came out totally evaporating. I think you have to have a certain amount of bravado and inner strength to push back against society enough to transition, but for me at least, that's all but gone at this point.

I despise my appearance even though people tell me I'm attractive — all I can see is a misshapen man. I constantly feel as though I'm either getting one over on people (lying to them) or forcing them to play along with my delusion. I compare myself to other people all the time and inevitably find myself wanting.

I've been on meds, in different kinds of therapy, tried psychedelics — nothing's stuck. At times I've wondered if transitioning at all was a mistake and maybe I should have just been diagnosed with BDD or something. At this point, I don't know what to do. I have a loving partner, family support, a decent job, and a stable living situation and I still hate my guts for being trans. I've stepped back a lot from trans community or even discussing that aspect of myself online or in other parts of my life, because it's made things a lot easier for me — but I wonder if it's also reinforced my shame around this aspect of my identity.

Any advice on dealing with these kinds of feelings, especially from people who have been out for longer amounts of time, would be appreciated."	"I hear you. I wish I had something wise to say. I long ago considered that maybe I was delusional, chose to not reject it out of hand, seriously look at the possibility. The conclusion I came to was that maybe I am, but if it is a delusion, it's one that I find more peace going along with than fighting.

I'm sorry to hear you feel ashamed. Sounds like you haven't gotten to the point where you truly accept yourself, warts and all. You don't have to be perfect. Too many people rough themselves up by comparing themselves to idealized standards. It's a setup to feel miserable, and you are not being fair to yourself."	yivnqd	trans	7	0.89	2022-11-01 01:58:24
His name is Alex	"Does anyone know what happened to Alex? 

Remember that video that went viral back in 2020 about that boy named Alex and he made cosplay tik toks?

There was that one video where his mom went crazy and was publicly shaming him for being trans and calling him by his deadname and misusing his pronouns. There were tons of people talking about it and there was a petition and his mom got fired from her job. 

But no one ever found out what happened after.
He apparently went back with his mom and she deleted all of his social medias including tik tok and Instagram.

Remember. Remember.	"Remember why you're here.

There was a time you couldn't imagine being here, wasn't there? Where you threw your arms up and held yourself in, and you cried. ""I'm not Trans-"" Or maybe you said, ""I'm broken.""

But you're here. It wasn't a fetish. It wasn't a fracture in your psyche or a malignant shadow of some mental illness. You faced those demons. You stood against the torrent of fear and emerged clean the other side. You're strong for that. You are stronger than you realize. And now you're here, in this unthinkable place, as your unspoken self.

But those years leave marks- you spent so much of your life believing a lie. And everyone was in on it. And now that the truth is out, you feel like you can't trust it, don't you? That you can't trust yourself? But you must. You must have faith. Because you're here. And the days ahead will be all the brighter for it.

Remember why you're here. Remember the nights you prayed or the days you dreamt. The feelings in your stomach that they told you meant something wrong. The wishes in your heart that you thought were shameful. The pain that you carried, even when your shoulders felt free of weight.

You are here. You've come so far. So know that we all doubt. We all are afraid. But that doesn't make you a coward. It doesn't mean you're wrong. It means you're you, and you're fighting against all those broken promises that were made to a person that didn't exist. Remember that confidence isn't about unyielding faith. It's about weathering the doubts and the fears, it's not about forgetting them.

You are here. And when you stop, and the sky feels like it's falling, and the earth shakes beneath your feet, and those voices in your head scream so loudly that you should doubt and defile the name you have given yourself, remember. Remember that you're here. You are here. And remember this knowing that we are here for you."		pqfhbl	trans	8	1.0	2021-09-18 04:08:50
I’m still sooo confused	"I’m 56 years old and remember feelings of confusion even at 8 years old. Iooking in the mirror I thought I’d see a Toyota but I was facing a truck and I said to myself “how do you drive this thing” As puberty hit I did not welcome it and the more hairy I got the more dysphoria I felt although back then I didn’t have a word for it.  I was occasionally sent to school wearing my moms pantyhose as long underwear and that filled me with a mixture of shame guilt and euphoria. Back then the euphoria made me feel I was a weirdo and I had something wrong with me. I used alcohol to escape a lot of those feelings . over the years I have been cross dressing and purging until finally I met a woman who was accepting of my questionable clothing especially when I began using it in my art photography . I kept all my clothes without the constant guilt. But for the last few years alcohol has been an issue again with constant relapses and my Councelor has me thinking it may be due to the anxiety of dysphoria and she also suggested something I can’t stop thinking about . I told her that back before my son was born I used to. Crossdress for art photography and when I was finally done with the last of my makeup I looked into the mirror and I said to myself”there you are”  I was in tears when I saw myself and again last week at my session and she suggested I might be trans or at least I should take a look at it. there has been some talk of doctor referral and possible hrt although if I were to physically change to much it would be the end of my marriage I’m sure.I’ve been married 25 years and I’m not interested in losing my life partner 
So let me end by saying I’m not sure what to do and I’m sooooo confused! I guess at the very least I am happier knowing than not knowing what’s been going on inside me all along"	"Go to therapy. Talk it out. I’m in the same boat. I added manly/dangerous job to the mix in attempts to thwart these feelings. Also keep in mind that the trans experience is a spectrum from simply identifying feelings to full medical/surgical/social transition. You don’t have to do it all to be valid. Feel free to pm me.
Assuming the woman you met that was ok with you wearing ""women's clothes"" in for art is now your life partner, talk to her about clothes.
A very recognizable story! (Except for the purges; nobody comes between me and my dresses:P)

Just want to vent	"I hate dealing with gender dysphagia and repressing it my entire life.

I've gone to therapy to talk about it but at this point idk what I want anymore.

If I could flip a magic switch I would but that's not real, and overcoming the hurdles of my own masculine body and voice are impossible.  I've tried a lot to set myself up to transition but I get entirely discouraged with my results.

My own fear and internalized shame of having these feelings keeps me from experiencing life in any meaningful way and I really wish I didn't have these issues to deal with.

Pre-coming out anxiety	"Hi all! Frequent lurker, never have posted. 
So I'm an 18 year old trans girl and doing online college at my parent's house because of COVID. My dysphoria has been worsening to the point where its too bad ignore and I would like to come out to my parents so I can begin my transition!

Thankfully, I come from a very progressive family- ignorant and trans issues like most people but very accepting.

I promised myself that this weekend I would come out to them- and I even told all my friends I would in order to shame me into going through with it. Right now I am rapidly fluctuating from feeling like ""hell yeah! You got this, lady!"" to overwhelming anxiety. 

Coming out to my parents just seems like such a life altering event, its scary to think about even though I want to so bad. I am sure enough in my identity to know that this is what I need to do but I still don't like the idea of family treating me differently- even though I also kind of want them to. And the awkwardness that will come afterwards? Ugh I dread it!

How can I deal with this? I so very much want to go through with my plan because I know a huge weight would be lifted off my shoulders and more than likely it will go well. But how do I work through that anxiety and doubt? And that fundamental trans awkwardness?!

Thank you very much,

i'm a trans guy & afab, but my experience probably doesn't fit the typical transgender experience. i've always been into 'girly' things with no shame about it, and i distinctly remember younger me liking it when others perceived me as 'feminine' and cute. somehow over time though that changed a little bit and i realised feminine gendered terms like she/her, being called a girl/woman etc just didn't fit my own identity. after a lot of soul searching and a couple years later, i started to identify as transmasc.

even so though, i honestly barely ever experienced that much dysphoria or discomfort. in my eyes, i'm just a dude with very feminine interests and i thought to myself that if i transition and society thinks of me as a man, i wouldn't be able to indulge in my interests anymore, so why bother. i don't really hate my body and even sometimes like my chest, i'm very comfortable wearing skirts and dresses, and while i don't like being referred to with feminine terms, it's not a big issue that impacts my daily life either (am not out to anyone due to transphobic parents & country). so that's the way things were, and everything was going pretty smoothly for me... until now.

i'll be entering university this year, and for some reason after attending an event to get to know everyone and make friends, i felt so much goddamn gender envy towards all the guys i met?? it's not like i don't ever get gender envy but this time it hit me particularly hard for some reason, and i even considered coming out when i found out how accepting of lgbtq people the students at my university are. ever since all this happened, i've been noticing and thinking about my appearance more, but not in a good way - i can't help but feel so ugly and while i initially enjoyed dressing feminine, now i feel like i would look ugly no matter whether i'm presenting masculine or feminine if that makes sense. i had a talk with my boyfriend and a couple of friends about it, and when they said they would support me in my transition and they think i'd genuinely look handsome if i started HRT, i legitimately teared up and almost cried? and i don't cry that easily over mere words?? now dysphoria is hitting me so so hard out of nowhere, but i have no idea why or if i'm even valid and this is just some phase since before this, i never cared too much about these things ;-;

the whole experience has made me realise though that although i told myself i could live closeted and not mind so much, deep down i really do want to be perceived as a guy by society. and i guess that scares me so much - my country really isn't super transgender friendly and my parents absolutely hate the community, so there's a lot for me to work out. i guess i'm just feeling so lost and also doubting myself... never felt like i was a valid trans guy and now i feel like i'm faking or something for some reason. if you read all this, thank you truly for listening to my silly rant and i hope you have a great day 💛"	"My fellow King, I believe in you. We all have our struggles and I believe that you can reach the end of it being your awesome self. 

It will be hard and I wish I could make it easier for you but oh the rewards will be so sweet. If you feel that you must take actions for your own self by all means take them (I'm referencing the choice of HRT). 

I may not relate with Dysmorphia but your attire does not condemn you at all. If you are a man that wants to rock a dress go ahead. No one can stop you. 

If anything know you are valid. You are a person and you are wonderous."	vk48km	trans	7	0.7	2022-06-25 01:59:54
Feel like maybe I've been in denial about being trans my whole life	" In recent months during lockdown, I've been forced to confront the fact  that I might be trans. I'm at the point now where I'm agonising over  whether or not to start hormone therapy because it's feeling really hard  to push this stuff down anymore: I'm increasingly unmotivated in my job  and feel a lack of direction and an inability to concentrate. In some  ways I'm suspecting it comes back to not having a strong male identity.  


My story in brief:  


**Dressing up**:  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to dress up as a girl. When I was  a kid I had a dressing up box and I remember being quizzed by my  grandmother (who I lived with) because I was always dressing up a  costume as a woman. This evolved in my early teens into sneaking into my  mum's room when she was at work and trying on her underwear. I used to  keep a little box of girl's/women's clothes that I would wear whenever I  was home alone. I sometimes used to wear girl's underwear under my  school clothes. There was nothing sexual at all about it at this point.  It was just this urge which was like nothing else.  


**Looking feminine**:  As a kid I always looked extremely feminine. I remember a girl on the  school bus looking at me when I was about 14 and saying ""you're just  like a girl"". In my teens older men would often hit on me. I've always  been relatively dainty and have extremely feminine facial features. If I  shave and grow my hair a bit I can still easily pass as a woman (I'm 28  now) with barely any make-up. (P.S. Not saying that those who don't  look like me are any less trans etc. I don't believe that at all. But I  find it interesting how I look so feminine to begin with.  


**Relationships**:  In my teens and early twenties I had crushes on girls. In my twenties I  made an effort to go to the gym and started to have more success with  women (the combination of being pretty and also being a bit manly too  did wonders). However my relationships (3 relatively serious ones all  with women) all failed. I went on a promiscuous spree for about a year  and a half (I slept with around 30 women in total) but the whole thing  was quite unsatisfying (except to my ego which I was trying to pump up  with this image of a sexually successful male. I'd often have to take  viagra to get hard during intercourse. I don't really feel like I was  doing it for the sex, more for the ego boost that went with the sex.  


**Sexuality**:  Ever since I was about 17 I have been watching transsexual pornography.  But never from the perspective of the man, always from the perspective  of the trans actress. That's always who I've fantasized about being. At  times this has turned into a bit of a porn addiction. Some people might  say that what I really have is a fetish, but I was always wanting to  dress up as a girl even before I found porn. When I masturbate or think  about sex it's almost always with me as a woman and a man having  penetrative anal sex with me. I've been with 3 men but the sex was never  that good. I think because I wasn't that attracted strongly to the men,  I just wanted to try it. There is a certain type of man I am attracted  to though, and I think if I tried it with someone like that I would  enjoy it a lot more. I often use a dildo on myself and love the feeling.  I never even experienced pre-cum until I started to use that on myself.  I am still attracted to women but I am more sexually turned on by the  idea of submitting to a very manly man. I want him to penetrate me, but I  do not want to penetrate him. I haven't yet because I was brought up in  the countryside to feel shame around being gay, bi or trans etc.  However the urge is so strong and I feel like maybe I use porn to  suppress it.  


I hope all that makes sense. I think I may be  trans but I don't know. At the moment I'm letting my hair grow out (easy  anyway during lockdown), trimming my eyebrows and losing weight so that  my body looks more feminine. People around me are starting to notice  something is up. I'm so confused right now :/"	I’m 29 and I only just came out as Trans recently. I identify with a *lot* of these feelings. I’m FTM, and so I’ve always felt very drawn to all things masculine. Including on a sexual level (I’m a gay trans guy). So it was this strange feeling of wanting to be with someone, and also wanting to be them. So I think you should really consider exploring these feelings and try socially transitioning among people you trust, and see how you like it. If it doesn’t feel right, that’s okay! You can always stop. Do what feels good and feels right.	lwstyq	trans	7	0.9	2021-03-03 12:33:31
Hey guys I need to get this off my chest.	"Ive always dreamed of being a girl. When i was little I was always hoping that someday i'd wake up as a girl. Sometimes i couldnt sleel thinking about it.

When i was beginning puberty I sometimes would go to my sisters closet when i would be home alone, and then I Just put on bra's en dresses and acted as if I were a girl.

Now that I have my own income and stuff I finaly thought fuck it. I ordered make up and some nice clothes and a wig. When i tried them out I finaly felt good about myself.

But I dont know what I am. Whole my life ive been sort of akward about lgbtq People altough I feel like I am myself. Part of it was Just imprinted in my head out of my own shame I think. And the other part is that my first real love suddenly called herself gay and asexual en then in a week left me and really shatered my hearth. But I am beginning to open up to the lgbtq family and to myself.

But there is Just so much shit because I wanna be a woman, but I dont like men. And I dont really wanna open up to People I know because I am really insecure about this. Im also in a really loving relationship with my girlfriend and I'd never want to leave her. Because is the most important thing in my life. But shes straight and isnt really comfortble with lgbtq People. Just like most of my friends and family. :(

I.. I Just dont know what I am, I desperatly want to be a woman. But like in secret. And I only like women so... What? I dont understand myself and its really pulling me down lately.

Thanks for reading my dears.
I really needed to get this of my chest.

Cheers, <3

I just had a cathartic crying session	Earlier I got out of the shower, grabbed my towel and looked at myself in the mirror.  Messy hair parted to the side, stubble on my face (took a couple days off from shaving after my sixth laser session) and wearing nothing.  And I saw a women.  A beautiful women.  I saw myself. Then I remembered looking in the mirror less then two years ago, short hair, trying to feel “sexy” in a dress and feeling devastated.  Feeling horrified at my maleness. Feeling so ugly.  Thinking about that made me cry.  Because I wasn’t able to help Emma at the time.  Remembering all the self loathing, shame and self hate.  But I made it.  I finally am comfortable with who I am.  I’m beautiful and finally have self love.  I’m moving on from that.  I made it.  I’m here and thriving .  It’s going to be ok.  🙂		byt3ys	trans	8	0.91	2019-06-10 03:48:54
I finally said it	"I know this might be a bit of a self-indulgent post, and I hope this is the right board for it because I just have to share.

I couldn’t sleep last night. For once it wasn’t terror, it wasn’t regret, and it wasn’t a deep psychological crisis. It was excitement. It was that same feeling I used to get as a kid on Christmas Eve; that feeling of not knowing exactly what the morning’s going to bring but still being kept awake by my heart pounding with excitement about everything it could bring with it.

I’m 33. AMAB. And for more than 20 years I’ve been constantly battling my gender identity. 20 years of waiting to grow out of these feelings, 20 years of convincing myself that this isn’t real but also simultaneously telling myself it’s too late to do anything about but constantly thinking ‘well maybe one day’, and 20 years of being terrified somebody will find out my ‘secret’.

Yesterday I finally told my partner of 8 years about the nonstop dysphoria I’ve been feeling since I was 12 years old.

I told her about how hard I’ve tried to ignore it, how forcefully I’ve been convincing myself that its just an interest, that I’m just trying to be a good ally by watching hours and hours of informative and pro-trans content on YouTube, staying up all night reading about the euphoria of transitioning and the struggles people face while doing so, I told myself that using apps like FaceApp and Reface to spend hours imagine myself as a woman on a sometimes daily basis was just a fun little curiosity, along with other little “meaningless” quirks like dreaming over and over that I’m transitioning or have transitioned, being genuinely and wholeheartedly inspired by every person brave enough to have made that step that I never felt I could, being constantly jealous of women for how they look, choosing a female avatar in every single game and platform I could and lying to myself that it’s just for the sake of variety and not because that’s how I feel the most comfortable projecting myself, and stocking up on egg memes like I was ready to make the world’s biggest omelet.

After years of convincing myself it’s all just a fantasy, or a fetish, or a phase that I’ll one day grow out of, years of presenting as strongly as a male as I comfortably could despite loathing masculine styles and clothes, growing a beard to help suppress my dysphoria and hide a face that never quite felt like my own. I finally decided that this is never going to go away. That if I don’t confront this, if I don’t seek professional guidance and support, if I don’t tell my loved ones just how big a part of my life this is and always has been, that I’ll end up spending the rest of my life feeling exactly how I have for the last 20 years. Wishing that I’d had to courage to embrace my feelings rather than be burdened by the pressure and paralysing shame that I’ve been told I should feel for not wanting to conform to exactly what’s expected of me.

I finally told my GF, and she was so unimaginably supportive that I’ve barely been able to hold back the tears of happiness and relief over the last 24hrs. For the first time in my life these feelings feel valid, they feel real, and they feel like they’re finally going to be a part of my life and that I’ll have that support there for me for when it gets tough. We’ve both agreed that I’m going to reach out to a professional counsellor this week, and together take this process one step at a time in whatever direction it takes us.

I was so indescribably scared, so scared that everything I held dear was going to come crashing down. I knew deep down that she’d be supportive, but somehow it was still such an amazing shock to have her hold me in her arms while I told her, for her to ask earnest and encouraging questions on all these things that I feel have defined me for so long that I’ve never had the courage to say out loud, and for her to be so eager to help and support me. I’m still scared about what the future’s going to bring, but it feels like that good scared; like the feeling you get before going on a rollercoaster, a scared that’s entwined with a massive thread of excitement that’s going to help to keep me push forward.

For the first time in my life, the hope has overturned the shame, and I can’t wait to start my journey wherever it leads.

If you’ve read all to the end of this little egg’s ramble then with all sincerity, thank you."	"Still cis tho

How do you stop internalized transphobia? I feel like mines just getting worse, mixed with the shame and uncomfortableness from dysphoria.	I rarely even call myself a trans man online anymore, just a man, as I somewhat feel uncomfortable by the word trans. As I am trans and of course not a transphobe, I want to stop it but I have no idea how.	"Probably not a great opinion, but you are a man. I’ve had this idea that using the term trans was a great way for straight people to separate you from them. An exclusionary word. Not to say you shouldn’t be proud of what you’ve been through. Saying trans is a testament to your strength and courage. Saying trans reaffirms you are part of a bigger community. You are a man and you are also part of the trans community and they need you to be strong with them. As a gay man, I see you as a man. Sorry for my words. I’m not an expert. You be you and be proud, because you should be. Wishing you happiness

Honestly I can't say there's an easy way or a hard way there's just a way you see yourself! I have felt the same feelings for quite some time and I have wondered in my own way how to escape these feelings! All I can say is the only way that worked for me was that I was able to start presenting as myself and working towards being me in dressing and acting and voice and all aspects! Once I accepted all that, I just started loosening up own internalized transphobia!
The way I stopped internalized transphobia was by dealing with the childhood trauma at its root, rather than just pretending it did not matter. That's useless if you didn't get emotionally or physically abused over your identity, but if you did face such abuse over any prolonged period of time, you might want to look into trauma therapy.
Take every thought captive. When you start thinking negative replace it with a positive. I promise you that it not only gets easier to do the more you do it but it becomes automatic. This is CBT bby
thank you, it’s a great opinion and it put some of my thoughts into words
It’s discomfort with the word and the fact that I am. I absolutely do not think this of anyone else, but I myself feel ashamed and therefore do not want to come out. Hard to explain."	12blkq8	trans	6	0.72	2023-04-04 14:55:38
Coming to terms with sexuality during transition	"Hi, y'all! No, I'm not from the southern U.S., I'm just practicing using more gender neutral language for groups of people, and I think ""y'all"" is just really nice. Also, currently a little loopy thanks to pain meds, so apologies for rambling.

Anywho, down to the point: I'm a trans woman, 34 years old, 7 months on HRT, 9 months out of the closet. I've known I was trans for about 12 months now, so I guess I'm still a baby. Maybe an adolescent trans? Is that a term? I dunno.

For most of my life, I considered myself to be ""mostly straight"". I never really looked too hard at my sexuality, possibly due to internalized homophobia/shame. My first sexual experiences were with a male friend starting at the age of about 14, but all of my serious relationships and attraction (envy? Still working that out) have been with or directed at women. Once I got a few months into my transition, however, I started to take a good hard look at my sexuality, and realized that I'm most likely pansexual.

This doesn't bother me at all, I've never judged others for their sexuality despite being ashamed of my experiences with the aforementioned friend, but lately I've started actually LOOKING at guys and some of them are kinda cute. This is very weird and new to me, to say the least. Not unpleasant, just... weird.

My wife, who is 33 and nonbinary gender fluid (there's a story there, believe me), is supportive of this and we have spent quite a bit of time discussing which celebrities and friends (across the spectrum of gender expression) we find attractive. It's a lot of fun, and super validating!

Through all this, I've found a few tough spots in my own exploration of sexuality. Namely, trying to figure out what physical traits, if any, I find attractive in people of varying gender expressions.

Masc presenting people who are tall, not overly muscular (either thin but toned or ""dad bod"") with a bit of scruff and dark hair are definitely my type. Liam O'Brien is a handsome man. Also, Frank at my local Starbucks.  My best friend from highschool fits this, and it's been strange realizing I was probably attracted to him.

Androgynous presenting people are harder to pin down, but the lighter end of goth and the punk or skater aesthetics definitely do it for me. Ruby Rose is... Mmmmm.

Femme presenting people are where most of my trouble lies. I'm really struggling to separate attraction from envy, as I've always had a ""type""- shorter, curvy and long dark hair- I also know without doubt that I wish I WAS that type. My wife (when presenting fem) fits this, my last serious girlfriend as well. My ex wife much less so. Funny, that.

I guess my question here would be what have all your experiences been with exploring sexuality? Have any of y'all struggled to sort out attraction from envy? I'd be especially interested to hear from any trans masc or non-binary folks, as that group seems somewhat underrepresented on Reddit.

I think that's it, thanks for reading, and y'all are truly beautiful. Everyone is, in their own way.

Love you! *Hugs*"	"I just kinda figured out I was pan, I like people who are smart in the common sense way, kind, and understanding of my past trauma and how that manifests in adult relationships. I don't really have specific physical qualities I look for because a person could be the most beautiful/handsome person in the world, but also the hugest asshole. While the person who is more average looking has a heart of gold.
I have to agree that personality is definitely the most important aspect of attraction for me, without a doubt. That's one of the things that has made it difficult for me to decide which celebrities I find attractive, since for many I have no idea what they're like as a person.

A sense of humor is big for me, and sensitivity is extremely attractive. Other preferences vary for me depending on the person's gender expression, for example I like a gentler, more sensitive masc person, but I like femme people who are more assertive and outspoken. Androgynous folks can be anything, I don't really have specific preferences there.

At the end of the day, someone smart funny and understanding is going to be a potential hottie, regardless of expression. The rest is just details."	qdhljx	trans	8	1.0	2021-10-22 14:01:59
My stepbrother has a wedding in 7 months, wants me to be there, I (19MTF) will be 11m on HRT by then (4m currently) and I'm horrified I won't pass.	"So as the title says, my oldest stepbrother is having a wedding in 7 months and I have no idea what to do. He wants me to be there, but I'm afraid that I won't pass by then and will refuse and feel awful about it.

My whole family knows I'm trans and everyone is accepting, including my stepbrother's fiance's family. However I really don't want to show myself if I don't pass. 

Currently I'm isolating from everyone, except for my parents who I live with, my younger sibling, as well as my coworkers. I haven't seen anyone else I know in 4 months. I'll show myself once I get gendered correctly in public, but until that happens nobody will see me. Not even the majority of my family has seen me. 

So at this point I really don't know what to do. I guess all I can really do is wait, but once that time comes and I don't pass what am I supposed to do. My mom told me it's completely okay if I'd want to wear a dress, put makeup on or anything, and that everyone already knows that I'm trans since the news spread like a wildfire and everyone's okay with it. But I still very much worry that I'll be judged, mocked, shamed, whatever it may be if I don't pass. Like I'd stick out like an elephant in the room.

I'm starting injections next week and progesterone in a month so hopefully that can speed things up enough."	"[deleted]
I think you should go, I know the anxiety of not passing in front of a lot of people but those people are supportive and accepting so at least that, you're not alone :) maybe talk with your brother about it? I say wear what you want and I'm sure you pass. 11 months on E is a big change, give yourself some time! I'm sure it'll be okay
If you're 11m on hrt by the time the wedding comes around then a lot may change between now and then and you may choose to attend in all your feminine splendour!
I appreciate you genuinely caring, and I have been seeing a therapist. Although she's generally nice, she hasn't really been too helpful with the whole situation. A good informative thing she did tell me however is that based on what I told her I seem to be in a very depressive state.

But I've kind of given up and even skipped my last appointment and haven't rescheduled. So I really just don't want to bother. It's weird, it's like I don't want health and would rather suffer.

>There is no guarantee anyone will ever pass and even those who think they won’t pass frequently do. 

Well I'm hoping I do, but in the case I don't pass at some point (I made myself a deadline of like 2 years). I'll put myself 6 feet under. I made it very clear to my friends so they can prepare themselves for the worst if I don't ever pass. I know it's selfish, but isn't it selfish to keep me alive if I'm going to live in misery? One of the main goals with transition is to visually transition, so I'm hoping it doesn't go bad. Last thing I'd try is ffs, and hope it would fix me.

I'd also never wear a suit lol. Absolutely not, that would be peak dysphoria.
I still generally do fear anyone seeing me, I don't know what I'll look like by then, and who knows, genetics might be completely against me. Maybe I'll be fine and look passing by then and this is all for nothing but I really doubt it. And people could be fake, and say they support me just to mock me behind my back.

I should talk to my brother about it, but I haven't seen him in a while either, so I probably won't unless he reaches out to me. I generally just don't reach out to anyone.
I really hope so. I wish I was able to get ffs beforehand but I don't think anyone takes patients until about 1 year of HRT.

>Maybe I'll be fine and look passing by then and this is all for nothing but I really doubt it. And people could be fake, and say they support me just to mock me behind my back.

That's your anxiety and dysphoria talking. Please don't let that get to you, you look stunning and I'm sure they don't mock you or anything :)
It's not exactly that I don't like her, she's a good person and does listen to me, and I do trust her. But I don't like her too much as a therapist, she'll listen and sorta help out, but oftentimes it does nothing for me. She is a therapist that works at my college so it was free for me, but they have a limit for how often you can visit before it becomes ""long term therapy"" after that it was case management for 30 minutes. She would also often refer me to group therapy and I really just don't want to do that because people scare me. Though I should have told her that no matter how many times it's mentioned I'll never go.

I know I should look for another therapist but I honestly just don't want to. I know it could help and all, but I don't think I even want help. I don't want antidepressants, I already shove enough pills down my throat as is and I'd rather find the source of my issue than rely on medication.

 I had relatively low estradiol levels and that could be a cause of some of this. So the injections should boost it way up, maybe hopefully fixing it. But it also could be from seeing all the anti trans stuff that's causing me fear, the fact that I hate the way I look and dwell on it daily, and possibly even because I'm isolating myself from everyone. Though I still play games with my friend often since I have perfected my voice and am comfortable with that.
Pfff, I wish I looked stunning lol. I'm hideous and nowhere near female looking. I'd definitely look like a man in the dress and I'll never ever show myself that way.
[deleted]
I suppose, but I don't know if I want antidepressants, I know they can help, but I don't know how I'd have it prescribed and I genuinely just don't have the motivation to seek another therapist, and I definitely do not want to get in a group therapy session of like minded people. I don't need more suicidal people around me. Plus I'd just bring everyone else down.

I really just don't want to do anything, I don't want to exist, I don't want people to care about me, I just want to disappear and maybe in another life, live as the person I'm meant to be."	11hqp7v	trans	8	0.9	2023-03-04 05:30:26
i feel like no one understands the deep seeded fear and shame of transitioning	hi :) i’m a 17yo trans man. i’ve only just been able to admit that i am in fact a trans *man* and not nonbinary/transmasc due to the uproar of “fuck men” mentality online lately, and i’m getting closer to starting testosterone and truly exploring my genuinely masculine side, and im realizing how fucking scary it is. i’m pretty strictly t4t and dating a wonderful person right now who plans also to go on testosterone at some point and knows full well all of the changes that come with it, but as i was thinking about my outfit for pride this weekend i thought about possibly bringing out my “mustache” (peach fuzz) a bit with makeup and i realized im scared as shit. i feel like an idiot for wanting this, like its stupid and frivolous and im terrified once i go on t my partner will realize my body is disgusting and they’ll just be lying straight to my face when they say they’re proud of me or support me in my transition. disclaimer, rationally i know this is not true and it has no true reflection on my partner as a person or what their reaction would be, it’s jsut my rsd and anxiety kicking my ass again. anyways. i just wanted to know if other people felt like me.	Chill man, just be you. trust. They'll still love you. I was worried bout this, but im fine. It'll be good.	vha32n	trans	8	1.0	2022-06-21 10:22:21
I was messing around with Bing's new AI text generator to see if I could make the capitalist robot spew communist propaganda, in the process of testing limits I asked it to write a slam poem about a man who has a period. So this is for all my trans homies	"I bleed every month and I'm not ashamed
I'm a man with a period and I don't need to be blamed
For something that's natural and part of my body
Something that doesn't make me less of a man or more of a nobody

I bleed every month and I'm not alone
There are other men like me who have hormones of their own
Who experience cramps and mood swings and pain
Who need pads and tampons and sometimes stain

I bleed every month and I'm not weak
I'm a man with a period and I don't need to be meek
To hide my reality or pretend it's not there
To suffer in silence or act like I don't care

I bleed every month and I'm not wrong
I'm a man with a period and I don't need to belong
To a binary system that excludes and oppresses
That denies and invalidates and judges and stresses

I bleed every month and I'm not sorry
I'm a man with a period and I don't need to worry
About what others think or say or do
About how they perceive me or treat me or view me

I bleed every month and I'm proud
I'm a man with a period and I don't need to be loud
To make myself heard or seen or known
To claim my space or identity or own

I bleed every month and I'm here
I'm a man with a period and I don't need to fear
The stigma or the shame or the hate or the violence
The ignorance or the silence or the myths or the bias

I love supporting trans folk	"It would be an awful shame if some amazing trans folk use this post to share their creative projects

I would be forced into supporting all these amazing people. Oh what a shame that would be. I definitely don’t want to be flooded with everyone’s YouTube/twitch channels, Spotify profiles, podcasts and artwork. How could I ever manage ;)"	"Got me in a mood to start posting my writing online 😩
Hiii I am a music artist almost done with a song for my album. I hoping to have it done by New Years
damn it would be so sad if i forced you to go follow my newgrounds for shitty music. what a shame. frenchhornguy.newgrounds.com. wow what an awful day this must be. (don’t judge the name with “guy” in it, it’s a rly old name that i wanna keep even tho i’m not a guy no more)"	r1jqcx	trans	7	0.9	2021-11-25 00:46:58
What if I only wanted to transition because my body was feminine to begin with (and other things I've been panicking about. please help)	"I realise this title might come across as obnoxious or braggy but I've really been struggling recently and I could really use some reassurance. My mum has been trying to convince me to stop hrt for months and her latest suggestion is that the only reason I'm transitioning is because I always had a feminine body and now I'm scared she might be right. I'm 6 months into hrt and a few weeks ago I hit a rough patch. Before this I had been relatively stable and sure of my transition but I recently I started getting really bad anxiety and I started getting really scared about my transition. I keep crying at work and feeling constantly conflicted about my transition. It's no coincidence that this coincides with my mum's hostility towards my transition getting worse and worse but still, it's making me question everything and I can't stop thinking about it. She keeps making me read these articles by detransitioners and it's really getting to me.

As a child I was always the small skinny one. People would always tease me for how thin my wrists are and carry me over their shoulders as a joke because I was so light. I always took a weird kind of vindictive pride in this, like ""jokes on you I actually like being small and cute."" Maybe it was a defence mechanism or maybe it was dysphoria, who knows. When I started getting tall later in puberty I felt sad for a reason I can't really explain, I thought it was because I didn't feel as special because I wasn't the shortest anymore but I feel like it might have been something else. I tried to maintain my ""petite"" figure by avoiding sports classes because I was worried they would make me grow muscles. Jumping forward to a couple years ago when I started questioning, the fact that I had a body that was already feminine helped me feel somewhat less scared about my transition than I might have otherwise. It sort of felt like transitioning would suit my body better than being a man, almost like it would be convenient if I was trans. 

Doubt has always been a problem for me because I didn't really have any really obvious signs before I started questioning and I didn't really know I wanted to be a woman until a trans friend suggested the idea which is how it all started. I had the occasional fantasy of waking up as a woman or of being pregnant but it only happened sometimes and I never crossdressed or anything apart from one small thing which I don't count.

Most of the time I truly feel like I love the changes but sometimes I worry that it's not life-changing enough. It's almost like it's going too well. I look in the mirror and I see a woman, I look good, but I just feel... normal. Feeling attractive is a totally new feeling for me and it feels really good but what if I'm just trying to create self worth by being sexually desirable because I can't create any self worth internally. It doesn't help that my memory of life pretransition is getting hazier and hazier. It's only been a year since I came out but I don't feel like I can even remember who that person was or how he felt about himself. I was really miserable and completely disconnected from my emotions and sense of self but was it really worse than it is now, I don't remember how I felt, if anything. Somewhere during puberty my life hit a standstill and I stopped really being a person anymore. I expected my transition to sort of start my life back up again finally but it hasn't really done that. I guess that was a bit of a stupid expectation. It feels like I've woken up from a coma into an empty dysfunctional life and now I have to build a whole new personality with passions and relationships from the ground up and I don't know if I can do it. I wish there was some way to know if I would have been happy now had I not transitioned apart from detransitioning. I don't want to detransition, it scares me almost as much as my transition does. My emotional state is so fragile right now. One hour I can be so happy with my body and being a woman and the next I'm crying and the shame feels like it's crushing me. I can't stand how my parents look at me every day. It feels like hrt has slowly brought back my emotions and now after a few months all my repressed anxieties have suddenly been magnified tenfold and I can't cope. Have I just been so dead inside for so long that I don't know what it feels like to have real emotions. It's just so intense and stressful, are the mood swings from hrt supposed to be like this. Please tell me this is normal. 

Can anyone relate to my childhood experiences, or my trouble remembering things pretransition, or has anyone also had emotional problems at the start of hrt and has gotten better, or just any words of comfort. Please. I wish I had someone to talk to about this apart from Reddit and my therapist I don't even get to see that often, I just feel so alone."	"I think your mom is fueling your impostor syndrom - and she's really not doing you a service here. I know quite a few small cute cis guys that never ever wondered about their gender FWIW.

Also what you describe of your childhood and relation to your past self and how you feel reconnected to your emotion etc seems pretty dysphoric to me. wrt/ detransitionners, it's been observed that a huge majority of them do it for familial / social pressure reasons, and most often re-start their transition later when they can do it more safely. I can't comment on hrt mood swings since I've not started transitionning yet, but it seems to be part of the package indeed - and I can understand how this can feel scary if you were so totally deconnected from your emotions before...  

Not to say who / what you are - only you can tell - but really it feels like your mom is trying to gaslight you.
Your mums gaslighting you. 
Each time she brings it up just say ""why don't you want me to be happy? And leave it at that.
It may make her reconsider,  it might just make her feel bad and leave you alone.
I wish I could say what I really want. I'm so bad at self reporting my own feelings. I always question things so much in my anxiety that I don't even know what I want or who I am. I wish someone could just tell me.
Your right :( I always just feel so demoralised that I can't respond back when she says anything, I just want to lie down and give up. I really don't know how to address the gaslighting inside myself, i'm really starting to feel like I'm crazy. It feels like I can only sit here while she worms herself into my brain and I can't escape. I don't know what to feel anymore.
Every time one of those intrusive thoughts comes up, write it down, and think of a counter thought. Then use your counter for it when needed. It's a CBT thing, and it really helps
Thank you this is good advice. I need to learn to not spiral into my doubts and really try to fight back!
Hey no worries. Glad I could help put you at ease"	w4aohn	trans	7	0.88	2022-07-21 07:48:33
Saw a post about dissociation and it brought back some things.	"Hi all! I'm 34 MTF pan, I've been on HRT for a little over a year. I'm married to a wonderful NB gender fluid ace person who I'm lucky to call my wife. We've been together since before either of us knew any of these things about ourselves, so our bond is very strong. This info will be relevant, wanted to get it out of the way now.

As the title says, I saw a post a short while ago discussing anecdotal and clinical accounts of the symptoms of dissociation and their perceived prevalence among trans women, particularly those who transitioned late. Since I'm in a bad head space, I decided to do a silly thing and test out the ""lacking large swathes of childhood age memories"" and ""other past shit is hard to remember too, yo"" symptoms for myself. Those may have been paraphrased a bit, see aforementioned bad head space.

One panic attack later, I figured I'd scream what I dug up into the void in the hopes of maybe accepting it. I dunno, read if you want to. Also, NSFW a bit, TW for internalized homophobia, and dissociation and dysphoria.

Basically, I presented as a hetero male until I transitioned, so approximately 33 years. Given that I always thought I was straight, it's odd that my first intimate relationship was with my best friend, a guy. We were both way too young for what we were doing, but things happened anyways. I know he initiated it, but I was a willing participant. That lasted for quite a while, but it was never anything other than FWB, and we never spoke about it directly. He was tall and lean, and a huge nerd, like me.

Next best friend was from middle school into adulthood. He was also tall and lean, and a huge nerd. I spent a lot of time with him, lots of sleepovers, but it was always normal friend stuff. One time though, we were sleeping over in a tent on an island ( New England, no palm trees) and I started trying to subtly entice him. He had never expressed interest and was straight, and I had never considered trying anything with him. Nothing happened, and he never noticed (I hope) but I remembered. I was sickened by it for years, and just added it to that first experience in the pile o' shame.

Around the same time, I started hanging out with a friend from kindergarten, tall and lean. Huge nerd. Very close. Tried to entice him too, but poorly (thankfully) and nothing came of it. There's a pattern forming. Let's throw that one in the bin, too.

Fast forward to now! New(ish) coworker, cool guy! Great sense of humor, huge nerd, super smart and did I mention funny? Also, tall and lean. My heads been very scattered lately, but I've had some very unchristian (lol) thoughts about him.

I have a type. I guess I've established that. However, I propose that those first three close friendship, one that was intimate and two that I clumsily tried to make intimate, were my attempts at having a boyfriend. That first one has really screwed me up for years, but reframed that way... I think I can handle that.

At that time, I didn't really know who I was, and I thought I wasn't supposed to think that way about guys. That would make me gay, which was considered bad at the time. By stupid people. And children. So I've been ashamed this whole time, but not only should I not have been ashamed of homosexuality, I was actually trying to have straight relationships.

So, to summarize, social pressures in the 90s and 00s forced me into gay relationships, when all I wanted was straight ones. Also, I have a track record of trying to sleep with close guy friends that are tall, lean and nerdy. Dark hair is nice, too.

Goodnight void, thanks for listening!"		u9zj44	trans	6	0.88	2022-04-23 06:57:24
So... I came out to my wife.	"Hello all, thanks for passing by.  
This is the 3rd or 4th time that I try to post here.. because I am confused and afraid to be honest.

Well, I am 28 yo and I am a biological male and a like 3 weeks ago I came out to my wife as Trans (I think). I have mentioned to her that I always wanted to be a woman when we were dating like 4-5 years ago and that being with her complimented my lack of femininity.... you see I was not that lucky with the girls at all. And it was true... she made me feel awesome during that time to be honest. But now that we are married I feel like I need more.

I started crossdressing long time ago, I have memories of my old boy using my sister cloths secretly in the bathroom and when I grew up I started my own collection of lingerie (that I could use under my ""normal"" everyday clothing) and dresses. Which I destroyed more than two times because I felt ashamed. Those shame periods where when I started dating a couple of girls and when I started to date my actual wife. (She knows that I had that collection..).

Now that I told her how I feel... she is really supportive. And I love that.

But.. is my inner self that does not want to accept it. I feel like I will disappoint everyone, and besides that... we want to have a family of our own. We went through a rough year because of fertility issues and now... as far as I know HRT can make things even more difficult. 

I feel that I should just be the big boy that everybody is proud of. I don't want to disappoint my family nor my wife's. Also I am afraid of loosing my wife... because even if she supports me now, who know what could happen in the future (Fun fact... my wife is Bi (I know that since we were dating) and said already that I will be the best of both worlds, but... for how long that will be true).

I... just don't know what to do. I wish that this feeling is me with a crossdressing fetish.

Thanks for reading, any comment will be appreciated."	"Your kids can have 2 moms! Go ahead and start living as a girl and you will be way happier.
This is very common story. It gets better. There will be tough times too. The good times out weigh the bad. The good times slowly take over more and more. Now that you know it will eat you up if you dont do something.
Having your sperm stored is a thing and is common enough for trans women who might want to have kids eventually. So don't worry about that part, this should come up when you talk to an endocrinologist.

The bit about thinking you'll let people down etc. Sounds like imposter syndrome to me, pretty much everyone has it for various things, if your wife supports you, dont worry about it.
Maybe just try to take it day by day. If you feel comfortably dressing in front of your wife, and she's cool with it, just start there. I don't think one can figure out how it all can come together with so many factors. Luckily life unfolds moment by moment."	ijftsj	trans	6	0.81	2020-08-30 16:47:13
