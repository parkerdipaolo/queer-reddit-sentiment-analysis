i am being forced to detransition and i’m so scared	"for context, i’m a teenager and i’ve been out as trans (ftm) for 9 months. my parents are perhaps the least supportive parents i’ve ever met, but the situation at home was just about manageable until now. to give an example, they have contacted my school 6(?) times now to tell them not to respect my new name etc. and of course the school has ignored this as is their legal duty in the uk. they’ve taken away everything they can from me, including my phone which i haven’t seen since february and my money, but i’ve been coping until now.

recently, they told me they were taking me out of my school and sending me to an all girls catholic boarding school (where they assured me no one will accept my identity). they said they could not live with me anymore (i’m not a bad kid, i get straight 9s/As, have never gotten detention or even told off at school, and have never touched drugs alcohol or anything like that; my only downfall is that i’m trans). my school is like my safe space as it’s the only place where i’m safe to be me so i cannot bear to leave it - it’s like leaving home for me. so i asked them if there’s anything i could do to stay at my school and they said i’d have to detransition completely. i agreed.

so they wrote up a contract and made me sign it. i tried to attach a picture of it here but reddit doesn't let you do pictures and text so ill just summarise it:

i have to: 
- ""be known as"" my deadname with she/her pronouns (so telling my teachers and friends to call me by my deadname);
- ""dress as a girl, walk as a girl and generally present myself as a girl in all situations"";
- wear girls' uniform at school and wear a dress to prom;
- have a 2 month period of no social media access;
- ""avoid exposure to all LGBTQI+ materials in books and other media""
- ""discontinue all forms of breast compression"";

in return, i can:
- remain a student at my school
- be treated equally to my brother
- ""have use of a mobile telephone and sim card""
- sleep in my bedroom

(looking at it now, i dont actually get anything in return, i just get to keep the things i should have anyway)

so i signed it (because if i didn't i would lose everything i have) but now i'm really scared of how bad it will mess me up in the head. 

i'm scared i'll forget who i am (if that makes sense) and i'm scared i'll start (tw) self harming again as i did before i came out. i learnt to love myself when i was open about my gender and i am so scared i'll lose that. i don't know what on earth to do, i dont know how im going to go into school in girls' uniform in two days and how im meant to tell my teachers and friends to deadname me. 

i'm also just so so sick of them saying they're doing this because they want me to be happy and they care about me. it's borderline gaslighting i swear.

so i just have no idea what to do, either way i'll have to live as a girl and the thought of that makes me sick to my stomach. anyone have any advice?

TLDR: my parents are forcing me to detransition or else they will take away everything from me and move me to an all girls' catholic boarding school and i have no idea what to do."	"That ""contract"" won't mean anything, even if you're forced to sign it.
This is severe abuse. You do not deserve this. You should not have to accept it. Stay safe dude.
I'm so sorry you're going through this. I recommend talking with the school counselor about this, as it is a form of abuse. No kid should have to sign anything to be given equal treatment to their sibling and access to resources like money.
police  or social services ASAP    this is domestic abuse
What the actual fuck this totally is abuse and is not okay. As people above have said contact social services asap. If that feels scary maybe there is someone at your school who you feel able to approach about this?
Clearly your parents are more concerned with themselves rather than your happiness. Remember this when they need to go into a home.
I do not know your age, but consider if emancipation and moving out is an option you can consider. If you have friends whose parents might take you in, reach out. Your mental health is more important than following a straight path in life.

CONTRACTS SIGNED BY A MINOR ARE NOT LEGALLY BINDING. you do not have to do anything your parents ask of you in this regard, and if you feel you are unsafe around them, reach out to the law or a nonprofit near you
This is abuse. Other comments have given you good advice. Be strong, brother. This too shall pass. We are rooting for you.
Get social services involved and fuck your parents, they are awful humans
This is illegal and child abuse
That's not borderline gaslighting, they are forcing you to gaslight yourself. That is absolutely abuse
I don't have anything to add that others here haven't I'm just wishing you well because your situation sounds absolutely horrible!
You’re being abused call the police.
Your parents' contract they compelled you to sign under threat of duress has ZERO legal authority and only has authority in their heads. They can point to it all they want and say you agreed... It makes no difference.

You can always come back out. But I for one don't think you should have to detransition (it wouldn't really be detransition, you are trans) to be supported by your own family. They are being cruel. They are not being decent it caring parents.

If you stop reading about LGBTQAI+ people we will not stop existing, you will not stop being trans. They can't change your truth. They can only force you not to live it under threat.

It shows that their position has no merit that they have to exercise force to get you to comply to it. This will NOT change who you are. This will only delay the inevitable and they cannot stop your friends at school from treating you as you are even if your parents try. They can send you to an all girls' school and you would be a boy at a girl's school. Trust me that they might *try* to convince you that your own sense of self is wrong, but you know who you are and that who you are is normal and healthy, not wrong.
They are absolutely evil and Child Protective Services is the best option.
You absolutely need to call the police or social services about this ASAFP
Hey, I’m sorry you are in this situation. 

If it helps at all, this “contract” they forced you to sign would not hold up in any court or by any lawyer. You are a minor, you signed it under duress, and they are only offering not to neglect you if you put yourself in unsafe situations. It is absolutely ridiculous and they are using it as a fear tactic to make you obey. 

In my opinion and read of the situation, this feels like a last ditch effort. The catholic school probably costs some money whereas the school doesn’t, so they want you to stay there. 

My advice in the meantime is to make a plan and survive. It sounds like you have a great support system at your school, so you might want to think about what you are willing to do to save that support system. Keep in mind, the catholic school could be alright, but we can make an informed guess that it probably wouldn’t be as good as your current school. 

If you can gain access to a phone, that would be great. If you can’t, find something that can take pictures, like a disposable camera or a Polaroid. I would set up a cloud account that you can upload things to quickly that has good security on it. Take pictures of the contract, if your parents make you sleep on the floor or outside your room- take pictures, try to get as much documented evidence of the abuse as possible to support your case. Record them if possible when talking about it, the more you have the better. 
Also- if you have access to them, take pictures of all of your important documents, like your birth record, it could help you if you have to escape. 

If you are over 16, look at online banking apps to open your own account or another secure money option like PayPal or Venmo. Then you could do some gig work around school to make money- think tutoring, painting peoples phone cases, etc. make sure your parents have no knowledge or access of this account or this money. 

When you go to get outside help, a counselor or support services in your area, present all of this evidence as emotional abuse. 

Finally, if there is a period where you have to “detransition” to survive, keep in mind you still have options. If you have great friends, you can ask them to bring your clothes to school and you can change in the morning and the afternoon to spend as little time as possible in feminine clothing. You can ask teachers and counselors to call you by your deadname and she/her pronouns only when your parents are present, as well as your friends. Some of my friends in similar situations had a lot of luck making a “nickname” that was something just really weird (think like: two, or forks, absolutely not gendered and just weird) and all the friends would call them that in public situations instead of the deadname. 

Remember, the key here is just to survive until you are an age that you can escape safely. This is not forever and will not be forever. I am so sorry you are in this situation, but you will make it through. Having a plan and knowing when it will end will help you overall. If you have thoughts of harming yourself, please contact someone in your support network to help you, you can even get some radios or come up with a signal to say that you need help. You will make it through, and you will always be trans, even if it isn’t safe to express it for a little bit. 

Sorry for the info dump, I just wanted you to have as much advice and support as you could. Good luck and please reach out if theres anything else I can do. I’m also coming from the US, so I don’t know all of the resources available in the UK, but I can research them if it would help you.
Ik everyone has said this already but this is the part where you get the police involved. Literally just plain abuse
Sleep in your bed? My dude where are they making you sleep now?!

Parents need to learn that its never too late to die alone...

> and how im meant to tell my teachers and friends to deadname me

Tell your teacher exactly that, ""my parents told me you have to deadname me or they'll take away my FUCKING BED.""

... You don't have to swear but just let them know that it's deadnaming and you're being forced to tell them to do it under threat of child abuse. The obvious thing to do there is to not go along with your parents insane demands and report them.
literally contact police this is child abuse
People have already said that but yes - your parents are abusing you and you must reach out for any help you can
Though there's next to nothing i can do, i'll offer what little consolation i can: no matter how much they try to stifle your identity, they cannot change who you are. even if you return to ""acting as a woman"" it won't be the same in the sense that you're still trans, you still know you're trans, and (depending on how you go about telling them to use your deadname) your school and friends will still know. even in such a dark place, try to cling to that knowledge, as it can act as a great source of hope, a sign that things can get better, because your parents can only hold their grip on your life for so long, but your identity will stay with you as long as you choose to keep it, even if it remains out of sight.  
P.S. if you ever need someone to talk to, my dms are always open, as are my ears.
That's not borderline gaslighting, they just do not care about you. Get far far away and if possible try to get your brother away from them too.
Any form of contact signed under duress is null and void
This is abuse, Call the police immediately, IMEDIATLEY
This is so heartbreaking to read. I hope you're situation gets better, it's hard not being able to do anything as a minor.
For a 1st, minors are not legally bound by contracts at least here in the US, and I imagine it's the same there.

2, this is definitely abuse. You deserve better. I'd try to get social services (or what you have there) involved so you can get out of there.
Do you get a copy of the contract? Because I you do then you have been given written proof of their abuse of you.
Straight up abuse, in every way here. If I were you I’d immediately start a conversation with an adult you feel safe with and start it off with “Help my parents are abusing me.” 

If you don’t know it, please find the hand sign for domestic abuse (flat hand, thumb to palm, close hand to fist)
You might be scared to do this, but there is no buts about it, your parents are highly abusive and you need to get out of that situation, especially before they threaten conversion therapy as you mentioned being in the uk.

If that doesn’t work, call social services or the police should you feel safe to do so.
This is definitely child abuse. Contact social services ASAP
While I agree with everyone that this is illegal and you should child services, if they can’t get you help quickly enough, or if that help is insufficient, you should absolutely lie to your parents. Have your male uniform in your case at school and change once you get there, go see your school's direction to use your deadname for official communications and anything your parents might see only. Don’t consider yourself bound to that contract, but try not to let them know you aren’t respecting it
This is some russian gulag shit.  Just try to contact social services and just try to hold strong in the mean time.
Dude, you can always be yourself here, be yourself everywhere you can safely, and get to a place where that can be yourself all the time as soon as you can.

I tried to force myself to be a man for 33 years, my true self remained, time cannot erase you, your biological parents cannot erase their son.
This is illegal and a hate crime. This is out right abuse by the hands of your parents.
Everyone else's advice will be and is far better than mine but if the- um- shit what is it- the onethings everyone is telling you to call doesn't work I guess tell your friends and teachers to just continue to call you by your preferred name but when around your parents go by your dead name?  I don't know I'm not good at advice but it is what I've been doing around my parents and dress moderately guy like? Sorry like I said horrible at giving advice-

Edit: SOCAIL SERVICES AND OR COPS YES THOSE ARE THE WORDS-
i’m sorry :( it’s gonna be okay !! one day you’ll be an adult and you can do whatever you want to <3
 Call social services ASAP, this is literally abuse and I am so sorry you have to go through it.
Take a pic of the contract and use it as evidence when suing them or telling child protective services U dont need to stop being U
This is straight up abuse, I would get somebody involved.
ewww my mom tried to do the same thing. typed up a form requiring me to drop the trans stuff until I move out, keep running track, and some other things. my father threatened to send me to military school (i’m mtf) i’m very sorry you have to deal with this ik it’s hard, and if able please don’t be afraid to seek out help if stuff gets to rough. hey maybe even convince them to let you see a therapist to help you with the trans “problem” just so you can have someone there for you (this is what I did at 15)
I don’t know your mental state but please PLEASE, just know there are people who care about you. If you need to talk to people about being trans or anything here are some resources for that. Just know you are valid and an awesome human <3

This is utterly cruel. I don’t understand how this can be legal.
Contact the police.

That is the only advice you should take here this is cold abuse, get out, get to the police tell them what's occurring and refuse under any circumstances to return to your parents care.
As others are saying please get cps involved and if you have a supportive family member or friend that is willing to take you in get in contact with however you can
Edit: also gather as much evidence you can like the contract or written letters from your school about your parents contact
You’re getting great advice already but as the genderqueer spouse of a trans woman and the stepparent of a trans boy, I just want to give you a big hug and say I’m so sorry. Please keep us posted if you can.
if you’re not 18 you legally cannot be held to that kind of thing.  also please, please contact social services.  other people have said this but that is ABSOLUTELY abuse and is absolutely unacceptable.  you deserve to live in a safe and affirming space and completely denying your identity in order to even be able to sleep in your own room should NEVER be a tradeoff.  i am so sorry this is happening but please, please reach out for help.
along with all the other comments about contacting authorities i would consider getting out of that house if you can. if any of your friends' parents are accepting of who you are and willing to take you in temporarily i would consider staying somewhere else for a bit. you have the best read on the situation though so if you feel it would worsen things or subject you to retaliation from your parents then obviously don't. i'm really sorry you have to go through this BS. if i could fight your parents i would lol
My god that's criminal. Are there any relatives you can get to who will help?  Start planning life far away from them for the moment you can escape or legally get out in your own. Ot may be slow, but it's something to stay focused on.
You are who you are. They cannot stop that and you will not forget it. When youre a teenager, each year feels like forever and it is relative to your life but you have many many years ahead of you. A few years of playing a character can get you through. Once youre able to leave them, you can be yourself with impunity.

When I was a teenager, i realized I could never tell my parents anything nor act on it. I started living a double life, one in my head and a fake one in real life. I never forgot who I was and only felt my gender dysphoria more acutely. I knew eventually I would become who I am. I did affirming hobbies and had affirming friends which were benign enough to keep under the radar. I saw life has one very long play that I had to always act in.

You are who you are on the inside and if you can internalize that, dysphoria can be staved off for a while. An extreme alternative would be seeking out trans support groups and abandoning your family but that path is a hard one.

Another alternative, you may be surprised by the catholic school. Most of the LGBTQA people I knew growing up had begun their schooling in catholic school. You may be able to find a new family amongst the other kids. Most parents have a similar thought of sending their child to a catholic boarding school for being any flavor of LGBTQA.

Stay strong. As they say, don't let the bastards get you down.
This isn’t a contract, it’s blackmail. « You won’t get equal treatment until you live by our terms ». Don’t worry too much about it being valid, no adult will take its « effects »  seriously. 

Parents acceptance shouldn’t be dependent on wether you’re a « good kid » or not. They’re suppose to fucking help you become your top self and be by your side *even if* you had shit grades and  smoked pot.  It’s the fucking job they signed up for when they decided to have children. Someone needs to remind them of that. 

I’m so sorry you have  to go through this. You shouldn’t have to. 

As I’ve not seen it mentioned yet, try to save copieS of the contract pictures on safe places. On cloud or Google drive, or email them to yourself on a secret address. Just in case your parent take away your phone for good or ask for your logins or whatever. If you can, you may do this of other forms of proof of abuse, document it. Even if you’re not sure it is abuse, it might be very helpful later. 

Stay strong, brother. Take care of yourself and your mental health.
My parents will literally kill Mr if they knew I'm mtf
It reminds me of my relationship with my religious parents... They literally forced me to wear female clothing and pierced my ears with as they said ""fEmALe EarRingS"" when I was already 19... I can't believe I let them treat me like that, but in my country (Ukraine) I couldn't even tell the police about it, cuz they would just laugh at me and wouldn't help at all.
I don't know much about the UK but I'm sure it's much better than Ukraine in terms of trans-rights, so I hope you'll find people to protect you (maybe some social workers or lgbt organisations). Stay strong ❤️
This is abuse, and their demands are completely unattainable! They'll just keep forcing you to be something you're not, until it kills you.

Hope you're getting some help with this, you don't deserve any of it, and your identity will always be what *you* want it to be, not whay other people are trying to force you to be. Don't let them break you down, you *will* make it out of this.
This makes my blood boil.
Hey man just checking in, hope you are doing okay 💗
Any contract signed by a minor is not legally binding.
Just call the police.
I will message you when I can to help you come up with a safety plan for the future.
Legally I don't even think that contract you signed is valid.

Conact legal support this is abuse. I would make sure you have copies of that so called contract and any other information that shows them mistreating you for trying to find yourself.

With worries of forgetting who you are, trust me if you're trans it'll resurface even if you have to tuck it away for now. The things you fear missing out on now you can always experience later (finding that out myself currently)

If you need a friend or homie to just vent to let me know, I am in a pretty cool community of lgbtq+ people from many walks of life. Also very minor friendly!
This hurts so much to read. I wish you the best! I’ve seen others recommend stuff better than I could. I hope you find safety! 💛
child abuse
I am soo sorry for what you are going through. This sounds like it has to be a form of abuse.
Report them to the police, that is child abuse! Especially Mentally!
Please contact social services, this is child abuse. They are abusing and discriminating against you especially with the ""be treated equally to my brother""
Nobody can ever tell you who you are. Trust your heart and follow your truth!
I hope you can find a way to escape their grasp and become who you want to be
Call the police, social services, or childline (0800 1111)
Maybe try contacting the traver project? (I don't know where you live exactly) or the police?
Seal out safeguarding at your school or contact social services. Please won’t care, but social services and your safeguarding will. 
-
It’s not bad to be trans, they’re the bad ones for not being able to accept that you are their son/child.
Call 911 or find the online number for social services in your area. Right now. Do not wait or things will get worse. They only thing I would wait for is getting your phone and money back. You may need it. There is no way that is a legal document so what you signed is equivalent to a birthday card.  I wouldn't run away but you may want to go somewhere slightly far away from your house and tell the police your location. If they are willing to go this far than they cannot be trusted.
steal your stuff back and run to child services. you are more important than their opinion. don’t ever live your life the way someone else wants you too
Talk to a school counselor about it and they can probably get something moving towards child abuse charges. This is obscene.
All I can do is say I feel so heavily for you. No one should have to go through that. It does get better though. When you hit 18 they can't tell you jack shit.  Continue to do well in school so you can get a scholarship and go somewhere far away where you can live as your authentic self.

BUT I do have an idea: any time they tell you they love you calmly reply ""no, you love who you want me to be"" and refuse to say I love you back. Yes, it is passive aggressive but it may get them to subconsciously do some self reflecting. Just a thought. Best of luck to you.
Everyone has already given you good advice, and they’re entirely right about the abuse. As for the “forgetting who you were” fear, maybe you can cope while this is happening by writing yourself another secret “contract” where you’re like “I am still *real name* and I will not give in to what my parents are forcing me to be”.
These people should be put in a mental ward that is just harmfully psychotic.
My serious advice 
Get out there. Call social services. Your parents are abusing you.
If you want to live as yourself you will need to go to the court to A get the custody for yourself, or B get the state to take custody for you. You will need help for that.

Your parants obviosly hate you, and they abuse you. They dont love you as they claim, they dont want your best.
Get out. Take custody for yourself or give it to the state.
Tell the social service you are hurting yourself and that it is because of you cant beeing yourself at home. Tell them you're at risk of suicide if this thought ever came to you. Tell them that you cant live with your parents.

And if you cant get out. FUCK THEM! Make their live to hell so much that they want you to go. Always tell them it is their fault. They to gaslight you? Gaslight them back, harder. Just break your so called ""Contract"" 
Because YOU WILL WIN. Time is on your side. You will win, and then you can live as you want. Let them know that you will be gone as soon as you can, forever, and that it is their very own fault. They will never be able to change you. It is your right to hate them. Go let them know that.

My not so serious advice, this is something i would do:
Ouh and if they made their threat true, and send you to the christian school. I think if you destroy some inventory and insult some teachers, they would soon kick you out again. Just tell them you won't stop until they kick you. I'm certain they happily will. If they won't kick you, just continue destroying their stuff and insulting their teachers and especionally the rector. This is a fight, they and your parents will lose.
what kinda of parent makes their kid sign a contract!?!?
Talk to your school about this. 

At this point your parents are forcing you to act and behave in a different way just to be treated the same as another child in their care, which is straight up emotional abuse. They're also denying you life-saving medical care, which is neglect. 

Emotional abuse and neglect are two forms of child abuse that are taken very seriously in many jurisdictions. Some places, if they're somewhat backwards, won't see denying transition care to children as neglect, but they *absolutely will* see what's happening as emotional abuse. 

I wish you the best of luck, man. You don't deserve this. You deserve to be loved and cared for, and to be able to be yourself. I hope you make it through this unscathed, and I hope your parents get to sit and think *real* fuckin' long and *real* fuckin' hard about how terrible they are. 🫂
I hate to just echo what everyone else is saying, but this is child abuse. Get help asap, please. You got this, man
Tell them to go fuck themselves and that their completely unenforcable 'contract' aint worth the paper and ink used to draft it. If they send you to the boarding school, the school could quite possible respect your gender, which at worst means you can freely live as yourself within it (which I know will be difficult given the environment) or ideally they wont even allow you to be admitted into the school because it is an all girls school. If they dont do one of those two things, they are literally breaking the law.
Best advice? Get kicked out of that school. Identify as a satanist to people and learn what people in the satanic temple do and do everything you can to be disruptive and distracting to them as possible. Teach them that you matter to you and their feelings do not matter. Take your identity by force.

The most important advice of all is to never once give any room to them. Never obey, and always resist. 

I was never trans but I resisted absolutely everything they tried to keep me in a religious hold and I not only endured the pain but I retaliated by giving everything they sent to me. And action they try to make on you deserves equal reaction from you.
Stay strong and be safe brother
You can't sign a legally binding contracts under the age of 18?? Tf??
I would advise you to be ready to disappear. You can do official emancipation stuff when you're in a safer place. You literally do not have to be present for this abuse. It shouldn't be your first choice per se, but a valid option when the adults in your life fail you with no other options.
Run away if you can. I had to run or die.
Do they have a video of you signing the contract if not you can argue that they forged your signature for The contract. So get a new signature with your new name not your dead name this only applies if you signed with your deadname
What in the actual fuck. Does emancipation exist in the UK? You need to run. Yesterday.
Unreal... I litterally teared up reading this.... your parents sound awful... you sound like a smart guy tho and trust me as someone who started transitioning at 29 you will never forget who you are. It's so awful you have to go through this especially when it seems you are doing great in life... I personally wouldn't be able to stay, i didn't talk to my dad for 4 years when I was 16 for waaaay less. Just remember that you have ALOT of life to live after school and your parents can't control you forever... I rlly hope things change for you 😢 ❤️ 💙 💜 💖
Reach out to a lawyer and seek emancipation from your parents. You are amazingly tough to have survived as long as you have. And UK law considers you an adult at 18, once you turn 18 you don't need to have these people in your life anymore.
Bro your parents are abusive!

Dude I'm so sorry
this is like the worst form of torture. wtf.
Honestly, OP, this is just abuse. I know it's late there in the UK, but I would tell any friends you deeply trust what's going on at home, and get a bug out plan in place. Your support network is your best bet to get through this, and that may include leaving home to live with someone you trust until you can get help. You may feel ashamed about what is happening, and I get that, but your number one priority needs to be your safety.
Since you're worried about forgetting yourself having to do all that shit. Think of it like you're cosplaying a character or playing a character like in a videogame. Also just try telling your friends/teachers/etc to just deadname you and use the wrong pronouns around your parents. Technically they don't HAVE to know unless someone tells on you. Also could keep binder or tape or a baggy shirt and some gym shorts in a locker or in a purse(I have a purse i carry around it looks small but can still fit a whole outfit plus like normal purse shit) or something so you can put it on when you're away from them then take it off before they see you again. Sounds like a lot of work but it is do able
Hey hope you see this, as you're in the UK if you're anywhere near Liverpool you should check out something called comics youth they offer all kinds of support for trans / LGBTQ+ . Reach out if you need anything your parents aren't end all be all of your life, you'll realize this more as you get older but you shouldn't need to suffer until you're able to stand on your own many people can help :)
Fuck up their lives too.
My thoughts on this...

Assess what you're willing to risk/reward and try to find the best balance of what you can get while being as true to yourself as you can, while not making your life an unbearable hell.

This ""contract"" is under duress. As you said, you gain nothing, just have basics returned to you that should already be yours. So, if you lie or otherwise betray your parents on this, I'd say you're morally in the clear. They have failed you and put you in a terrible predicament. Now it is about survival for you.

Best of luck. I hope they come around, but if not, things can be better even without them in time.
Document everything. And when you’re comfortable/old enough, report them. 

I promise, even if you do get sent away, you’ll never forget who you are (/pos). Being trans isn’t something you forget. From one trans guy to another, you’ve got this. Your community will always be here. <3
Can you file for emancipation?

Not an easy route, but you seem like you're going to go no contact ASAP anyway
Do you know anybody who’d be willing to take you in and possibly go to court and get custody of you? I had a friend do that with their aunt before in a similar situation. Her aunt got full custody and she was able to live how she wanted. It’s a hard and long process and you may loose things to get more in the end. It’s always your choice and it depends on how much more hurt you can take. It’s definitely something you should look into. You can also get emancipated as well!
I just wandered in off the front page of reddit, but I feel very moved by your story. 

I think you're very brave, as well as a hard worker, smart, and able to strategize to meet future goals. I think you'll do just fine in life if you rely on those skills. You also know how to ask for support and you express yourself well, likewise very handy skills. 

You won't forget who you are. There will be other people around you who don't forget who you are. You can ask them.

It gets better. You'll be able to choose who you are close to. You'll be free to float, and flounder around in the world like we all do, but without the restrictions.
Contracts are not legally binding if you're a minor.
I deleted my other advice cause i read better advices. 
Cause people are saying it's proof it's abusive which I already knew but I didn't know the law in the UK would consider forcing a teen to detransition an abuse. 
So call for help. 

If needed flee from your home. 

I'm really sorry and sad you have to struggle with this, my dear brother. 

*crossing fingers*
How old are you? It sounds like you can't leave them now, which is bad. I am from the Czech Republic, our country is not supportive to trans ppl at all, so parents here are always the one in power and you can't do anything about it. A lot of trans I know are secret until they hit legal age (here it's 18) so they move out, away from their parents and live as they want to.

If this is not an option and your school is supportive, try something like: in the morning put on a school girl uniform (a little show for your parents) and as soon as you get into school, change it.
I'm also sure you can talk about this with your principal so they might be able to still adress you as he/him with your new name in school And if your parents come around they would switch into the old ones.
I see two solutions here:
- First one is to check with child protective services with the help of your school. And try to get out of your family.
-Second option would be to wait until your 16-18 to move out so you can transition. I think both are pretty hard… 😥😥
Contact whatever child protective service you can using resources at school and gtfo, anywhere is better than there.
There is a lot of good advice here. I'm so sorry you're going through this. The other adults in your life can act on this. Hang in there man. 

I just want to also comment on how ridiculous these demands are.  The way you walk, really? I'm a cis woman and when I was a kid I refused to wear girl's clothes. Somehow they aren't putting together that if they have to force you to change everything about yourself with a contract *maybe this is who you are*!
No minor under 18 can be a signatory to a contract. And no contract signed under duress is binding. One of the worst things something like this can do to you is make you feel like you're a party to your own wounding, and it's an effect abusers often strive after. But you didn't have much of a choice and it's not your fault.
Okay, so from what you've said this is what I've gathered.
Your school is supportive; you're out to teachers and friends.
Your parents are treating you worse than your brother, this is implied in the 'contract' they had you sign
You don't currently have a phone, or a bedroom you can sleep in, even though your parents have the means to provide these things.
Your parents have willingly socially isolated you and want to do so further by moving school. 

What your parents are doing is abuse, I would say emotional and neglect. 
Please speak to someone at school. Is there a teacher who you know is particularly supportive (most schools have that one teacher all the queer kids flock to)? Do you have a friend you can stay with for a short while? Or a more supportive family member? Just until the school is able to sort out something more permanent. SHOW THEM THE CONTRACT. This is a key piece of evidence. They wrote it and it admits to anyone who reads it that they are abusing you.
I am truly sorry my dude. I really hope things get better for you. If you wanna message me to chat through things, feel free.
Call the police on them. I‘m serious. That’s child abuse and child neglect and they can go to jail for that. Do you have any family members you can stay at?
0808 801 0400   call here  its free or email  info@mermaidsuk.org.uk.
Move here in Finland. I take care of you. It hurts me to see you suffer like that. Your parents don’t deserve you.
I intend to write an actual response but until then I just wanted to say that being trans is not a ""downfall""

Now, may have meant that that's how your parents, and possibly others, perceive you and you are just explaining it to us in those terms.

I mention this in the fear that they have convinced you of this though their unempathetic, archaic treatment towards you. You are a victim of their abusive behavior and it does not make them right.

You will not be there forever. Being a teenager itself is a transitionary period in your life that we all go through but it ends and your adult life will begin. I can't promise your adult life won't have hard times, in fact it's likely but you will have a lot of choice in where you are, who you are around and you will be able mitigate, to a large extent, how much shit you have to put up with.

Stay strong and I promise it will ease up some. As they say, ""This too shall pass.""
please report your fucking parents
Accept averything they say but not without reminding them you will never forgive them
Do you have any friends you could stay with?
RUN!
This is illegal op- CALL THE FBI OR FIRE STATION SERVICES AND GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE PLEASE READ THE COMMENTS AND RESPOND SONWE KNOW YOU ARE OKAY

You don't own anything.  Stop acting entitled.  Cell phones and your own room are not mandatory.  Just food water shelter and an education.
Asking people on Reddit is the last thing you need to be doing.
You are so young, and you have so many many years left here. Please try the best you can to have some perspective that your current situation is temporary. It will be OK either way I promise
I know fuck all about your country's laws and I can't give you any advice that haven't been already said but still wanted to share my support to you. Keep focusing on the light at the end of the tunnel, no matter how far it may seem, no matter how dark the tunnel is, there's still hope in the end.
Fuuuuuck your parents
I'd fuck my parents up, but that's cause I haven't violent tendencies due to my anger, but try calling your version of the Jungedamt
I'm so sorry. Your parents sound like complete control freaks. Things will get better! Eventually you'll be free of them. It's good that you were exposed to this side of them because let me give a warning that they probably intend to control you and tell you what to do for the rest of your life.
Holy shit dude this is so awful-I agree with everyone who’s telling you to talk to social services, and I’m glad that you’re talking to your safeguarding team at school (your school sounds awesome and I’m so happy you’ve found a safe place there!). 

Good luck, my dude-we’re here if you need us 🏳️‍⚧️ 🫡
Fuck dude, I'm so sorry about everything that's happening to you. If you need someone to talk to, feel free to DM me!
Fuck I am so sorry.  I really hope you get out of there sooner rather than later.  Your parents are huge fucking assholes.
Police or you equivalent of CPS.  
No middle mans, this ist much to important.  
Sadly UK is not in the EU anymore, that would give you some more leverage to overcome some issues I have read in other comments.
SEND. YOUR. PARENTS. TO. JAIL.
That is so fucked up. I'm so sorry your parents are being so horrible, bro. You should talk to your school counselor. My guidance counsellor literally saved my life when I was in high school and in the closet. Hopefully they can help you too. Also don't worry about the contract being legally binding; you're a minor and you were forced to sign it so it isn't. Stay strong, bro
🫂 don't worry. It'll all be okay, talk to the authorities or CPS or anything, they shouldn't control your life, it's horrible that trans people have to go through stuff like this and nobody deserves treatment like this. They can't control you forever, don't give up
I was raised in a Southern Evangelical Baptist home, with my grandfather being our preacher and running a church. I was put through conversion therapy.

What you're going through is abuse, but the issue to me on getting help is where you live. 

I live in a democratic state and desperately regret never reaching out and letting someone know who could help what was happening to me. In my state I would have been removed from my family. (Though from the words of friends and partners who were in foster care, that may or may not have been better. It really just depends on your social worker and the families you are placed with.)

However, if you currently live in a red state, an area that is republican, or a country that is conservative, I cannot recommend you contacting the authorities for your own safety and just to wait it out until you're 18 to move away (personally I moved out within 6 months of turning 18, though it was really hard, but being hungry and more poor than I can explain was better than my blood families home.) From support groups I've been in for survivors of conversion therapy I have really learned that in these areas you can't really ask for help because the law is in fact against you, or the people enforcing the law. 

This isn't to scare you, obviously my word isn't law, but I just have some friends who wished someone would have been honest with them when they were trying to escape their personal hells.

I know for one of my friends when their social worker came (they lived in Alabama) they literally told them to their face, at 14, that they couldn't understand why they (the social worker) was there because the child was ""clearly"" mentally unhinged for being queer.

Idk it's just really difficult and I know it's scary but I promise after 18 they really can't do shit to you.
You don't have to respect their made up contract as they leagaly can't hold you in court to it because I'm asumming you signed it under the age of 18 through forced circumstances. I hope your parents come to realise that no matter how you identify you are still the straight A loving and kind man that you deserve to be and I wish you the best in pushing through this tuff period and flourishing on the other side.
call fucking social services my man
This is actual conversion therapy which is outlawed in many countries (I think including the uk) you should call social services (or the uk equivalent)
this is abuse and i’m so fucking sorry you’re going through this. please call the police and get help. i promise this isn’t forever
This is not okay. I’m sorry you’re going through this. You deserve to live authentically and to be loved unconditionally by your parents.
When I first started transitioning, I didn’t say anything to my parents for months.(I’m MtF, but It should work as well for you.) I used to bring my fem clothes to school and then put them on. Remove them at the end of the day. They’re not here at school. They can’t do much if your school is supportive
This is 100% child abuse wtf. Your parents treat you worse than the USA government treats prisoners In Guantanamo bay
As you are in the UK same as me best advice i can give you is to either:

 A. Go to your local authorities website and contact child protective services on the phone number there 

B. Phone the police (provided that your father or mother is not a high ranking officer outside of the metropolitan police service)

C. Go down to your local police station and report it in person

Even in terms of here some of what they are doing is considered abuse (not all unfortunately thanks to the prat who has never seen a hairbrush) but hopefully they should be able to help you.

And lastly never stop being yourself and........... im not allowed to advocate violence against others on reddit so please dont let them pressure you into violence against yourself, i know it helps at the worst points but its not worth it. 

This older Sis doesnt do hugs often but *hugs you* best of luck Bro
[deleted]
Call the fucking police. Now. This is child abuse.
RemindMe! 7 days
Holy fucking shit your family is insane :(
Make sure you have a copy of that contract. I'm sure social services and the police will enjoy reading it. I hate to tell you this but you may need to turn in your parents for child abuse. Not good. What will you do without them? This is abuse and it needs to stop.
Dude find a friend or a supportive family member and go. your happiness and comfort  is the most important thing
If my parents ever treated me the way your treat you, i would run away so fast. Im already at my breaking point. Im surprised you’ve held on that long to your parents. I dont condone running away, but if you would feel safer away from the, contact the police or social services. The uk has given leagal rights to trans peoples, so you should be ok if you contact law enforcement. Gl with your situation, i hope it gets better 🫶💛☺️
Could you stay with a friends house? Call CFS or CPS. This is how kids end up hurting themselves. They feel trapped and feel there is no way out.
Pretend as long as you can do get as much of your stuff as possible and then run.
I'm sorry you are going through this.
Hugs if you need them.
Stay strong you can survive this.
I'm so Sorry!!  I dk what to say but if I can help lmk
I'm so Sorry!!  I dk what to say but if I can help lmk
Shred the contract, find a couch to surf, jump ship. If they can't live with you then, and I can't stress this enough, __GET. THE. FUCK. OUT.__

They clearly don't want you there anyway, fuck em, they'll survive.
I’m sorry you’re going through this but luckily I had strict parents so I can maybe tell you something’s I did under their roof for a bit with out them knowing I packed what o wanted to wear in my bag and would take it to school and change in the morning in the restroom and after school do the same thing if you have lockers perfect put them in there just in case they check your bag like mine did. Tell friends and staff to deadname you only to your parents they won’t know other wise I can’t think of anymore but if you need help I’m sure I can remember something’s
I really hate to say this especially having been in the system but comparatively at this point you're better off in foster care or a teen residential unit which are lgbt affirming. These 'parents' are going to end up pushing you over the edge and you'll end up 6 ft under I also don't care your dad is a lawyer if you're under 18 you cant sign a legally binding contract period. That 'contract' is as useful to them as the toilet paper on the toilet roll holder. To you however it's evidence of abuse against you. 
Please go no contact as soon as you can.
Would the catholic school even take you? Not that that’s any kind of option. I don’t know how old you are but I would think it might be easier to cut them
Off when you turn 18 at a boarding school. It’s not like it’s a legally binding contract. 

Let me add that I hope you get help to stay safe and free from this abuse. Our local school has been surprisingly positive towards the trans students, though not all the students are. 

Sending positive vibes your way.
>sleep in my bedroom

Are your parents not letting you sleep in your own room? If so, are they allowing you to sleep on an actual bed? Idk what child protection laws we have in the UK (ive never needed them, fortunately), but there must be some laws that should protect you
Don't really have anything to add that others haven't already said so I'll just go ahead and say this: They don't care about your happiness but you will get to live as the man you are so stay strong brother!
I’m so sorry. I’d try to talk to someone cuz this should be considered abuse. Talk to your counselor contact someone who could help. I’d link some resources or give some names but I don’t live in the UK. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you get out of their ASAP. I just what you know something- there is nothing wrong with you. You’re normal. Things will get better, you’re loved and always will be accepted here. Your parents are abnormal fucking pricks. I wish you the best of luck 🖤🖤
I'm the worst person for help about things like this but holy fuck, that is abuse and I really really hope you can get away from the pieces of shit you call your parents, what the ever living fuck is wrong with them

I really hope it gets better and this community will always have support for you <33
That’s horrifying. I hope one day you leave them behind and they wonder why you don’t want to see them again and you pull out the contract and then burn it in front of them.

And then you go live a life as yourself.
Gonna be honest, if this happened to me, I'd run away. Fuck your parents. They have no right to be considered as such.

I really hate advising as such, and it won't be without it's own challenges, but you aren't safe under their roof.

There may be resources you can reach out to that won't have you return to them, but I wouldn't spend another moment in that false home.
Here where I live you are taken away from your parents in an abusive situation such as this. I'd reccomend getting a school counsellor to contact CPS/community services to get you extracted from your home & put in a more supportive environment.

Oh my god that sounds absolutely nightmarish. Your parents are fucked up evil people and they are *absolutely* gaslighting you. They don't get to decide who you are or what's best for you, let alone threaten to isolate you and outright abuse you if you don't comply. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Here's a hug if wanted 🫂🫂🫂
Bro i'm so so sorry.

There are some folks in the comments with practical advice. I don't have much. I guess I just want to validate that involving state agencies (like child services) can involve a ton of uncertainty. It might be a little while before things feel settled. So make sure that you're also activating personal supports at the same time as you're figuring out logistics.

Your health and safety is top priority, and mental health \*is\* health. Think about who is in your corner at school, and make a plan for how you're going to loop them in to the /u/Fulled_ advocacy team on the first day you're back at school next week. (It wouldn't hurt to set up some emergency housing situations too, if you haven't already. Which friends could you stay with? How would you get there? Will their parents understand the gravity of the situation?)

You sound like a really good guy. /r/trans is sending you solidarity and support from afar. No matter how things land next week, a kinder future is awaiting you. That being said, I hope that very very soon your parents don't have the power to mess with you like this.
Your parents did the exact same thing my mom is doing. It’s been 4 years, I’m 16 now, 2 more years ro go. 4 years after they made me sign their contract, which was chillingly identical to yours, I can dress and act the way I want. Mom has made me grow out my hair for the past year, before that I just cut it myself. When I do express myself though my mom makes pissy and perverted comments on how I should show off my tits. 

Contracts signed by a minor are not legally binding. Just try to please your parents when you’re around them, and do what you want otherwise. You can dm me for more advice.
Get authorities involved asap. Good luck dude
Hhjf
Contact social services. Talk to your school. I went through similar and it helped. I hope things improve. This is abuse you really need to get some sort of authority involved
You are who you are, you won’t forget it. Other people on this thread have suggested many methods of seeking support, so I won’t reiterate them. What I will say is that, in the awful situation where nothing works and you’re forced to present as female, in the end, it won’t change who you are. Using your deadname will be uncomfortable, maybe even traumatic and damaging to your mental health, but it won’t and can’t erase who you truly are. You are you. And though times may be hard, and you may face intolerable cruelty and prejudice, know that your are loved brother, and that your allies are out there and you only need to preserve until you’re free to find them. Stay strong and be brave xxx
On top of the obligatory this not okay or legal, I feel you might also benefit from r/momforaminute 

❤️❤️❤️
This is actually how my grandmother would act if i came out to her. 

she is also unsupportive and homophobic. (I Literally heard her say transgender females are men who want to be women. so you're not alone.)
The best part of this is that you get to disown them with zero regrets at 18 and whatever your last words are to them will stick with them for the rest of their lives and they *will* fixate on them. You, however, get to move on and will only become happier the farther you get from now. It'll only get better. You got a while to think up those final words to them, too. You get to make it extra biting.

Best of luck, friend. Stay safe primarily. Personal happiness and emotional revenge later. 👍
also i would run away the night before i had to go
Other people already mentioned to contact social services and try to get out there asap. I don't know how these things are handled in uk, so i don't want to give you bad advice. But if there's a possibility of getting out there, without making your situation worse, please consider it. What your parents are doing is straight up abuse.

Besides that, i don't really know what advice i can give you. I'm not at all familiar with situations like that.

Do you see the possibility to ask your friends (and maybe your teachers, but that seems risky to me) to keep using your name and pronouns, without your parents knowing? Could you maybe find spaces where you can present as you, without your parents knowing?

I wish you only the best and if you feel that it could help you, you're welcome to contact me. I don't know how much help i am, but i can listen and try my best :)
Ok this may seem harsh but I recommend u carry on transitioning as u are and play chicken against them if they take away stuff such as a bed or food or anything like that immediately go to legal services such as police as that is child abuse and if the literal child is going to it then they will have to do something, u said u lived in the UK have u tried childline?
Go to the police and safeguarding team of your school. It’s your parents responsibility to care and look after you. This is abuse and they’re restricting your rights as a person. No matter who you want to identify as you are their child and they should love you no matter what. 

I hope you get the help you need to stop your parents being like this mate. Try to keep your chin up and get your voice heard
that is one of the most horrible things I have ever read
Quote from Wikipedia regarding English contract law (assuming OP is from the United Kingdom and is underage)

**”**Unconscionable agreements can be escaped where a person was under duress or undue influence or their vulnerability was being exploited when they ostensibly agreed to a deal. Children, mentally incapacitated people, and companies whose representatives are acting wholly outside their authority, are protected against having agreements enforced against them where they lacked the real capacity to make a decision to enter an agreement. Some transactions are considered illegal, and are not enforced by courts because of a statute or on grounds of public policy. In theory, English law attempts to adhere to a principle that people should only be bound when they have given their informed and true consent to a contract.**”**
This hurts my heart to read this. 😭
as others said this is literally textbook definition of abuse. keep those photos of the contract. speak to professionals on this matter as others suggested and present proof through said images.
Divorcing one's parents so you can leave before you are 16 and still get support is a thing or was 25yrs ago in the UK. I am so sorry this is happening to you and once you can leave never look back or talk to these abusive assholes again. 

You will always be trans they can't take that away from you even if you walk about in your agab clothing with no meds and your deadname - that isn't you. Just the same as I am still nonbinary and haven't changed anything about my presentation (apart from smiling more) since realising. Too bad for them that gender doesn't equal presentation and no one decides your gender but you.

Living on Terf island is bollocks, isn't it :(
Run away, u gonna let ur mom and dad tell you how to live? Take as much money as you can from them, run away, and never talk to them again. If they call the cops act like they abuse the fuck out of u
dude i will fight your parents
They made you sign a contract under duress, and you're too young to be held liable to a contract anyways (unless it's different there) What your parents are doing is abuse. 

I assume Boarding Schools probably had/has a different definition before Colonialists brought the concept to the Americas, but in America and Canada* Boarding Schools were Concentration Camps. *Called Residential Schools in Canada. They abused whoever they could, but they systematically erased or eradicated Native Queers in particular.

Do you have any other family members that you can live with or talk to? Preferably ones more sane and accepting? Anyone in your family that isn't transphobic would probably give your parents an earful, if not a shit kicking. Maybe family leverage can fix or alleviate your issue.
Bro just leave.
Yeah it will be horrific but you’ve got to reach out to social services. I mean- it can’t get worse? My god. I’m not trans but my 19 yo son is, and I cannot imagine ever treating him like this. I’m in the US, I can’t do much but I’m your mom if u need me any goddamn time. Here for you.
This is literally domestic abuse. That contract doesn’t mean anything in the eyes of the law. If I were you I’d call social services on them. The ‘borderline gaslighting’ is literally just gaslighting. They’re discriminating against you and abusing you which last I checked was illegal. You really need to call someone who can take you out of that hell. Please stay safe brother ❤️
Man fuck your parents.  Fuck that makes me so mad.
I'm sorry but fuck that/them. Sorry for how they're treating you.
Are there any counsellors at your school that you can talk to?  
You need a respectful adult to intervene here because this is starting to sound a lot like child abuse.  
I hope things get better for you, man.  
Good luck <3
perhaps try contacting social services or 101/999 police, to get you out of that house and out of your parents control. this is child abuse. i believe i have various helpline numbers i picked up at my local pride which may be of use to you, i will list them in reply
so id say tell your school about the situation you’re in, and ask them what they think you should do. your parents suck, man.
This is family violence. Have you thought about making a report to police or your local child protection service?
You should call the UK version of child protective services. I know it might be scarey, but you are not safe.
If you don’t mind me asking, how old are you? I’m pretty sure the UK is the same as Australia so by the time you’re 16 your parents can’t force you to do anything.
That is absolutely fucking awful. Your parents should be ashamed and absolutely should not be parents. I am very sorry you have to deal with them.
This broke my heart. I wish I could take you out of this situation. This is so inhumane.
If you have dysphoria, ask your parents to see therapists who can treat it. Your clothes, after all, do not define who you are. Even if you have to wear ""girl"" stuff (though there's no such thing), it's gonna be fine if you get help to treat your mind about it. 
You parents may be right in thinking it's to early to make such a big life decision. Your truth is inside, just know who you are. You're not your clothes, accessories, hair, etc.
Dude, just tell ur friends and everyone in your area that is supportive. This is just straight up abuse.
Its not alright. At all. 
Even call the police or something idk if there is an associaton for minor protection somewhere where you live but do search on that as well.

They are not treating you like their child even.
To be honest, I think that at this point, I wouldnt show any sympathy to them in your place.
Those wouldnt be my parents anymore.
Just the two people that gave birth to me.
Same happened with my dad and my dad didnt do as much as yours and I still dont give a shit about him.

Anyways, dawg, this aint alright.
They also are incredibly dumb to think that going to a catholic all girls school will brainwash you lol
Lots of great advice here OP, you DO need to take this seriously and get help. In the meantime, you need to immediately start preparing to remove yourself from this home environment-move in with a friend or supportive family member, save money/move it somewhere your parents don’t have access, etc.

Detransitioning must feel huge and overwhelming. From what you’ve said here, you need to appear to “conform” to protect your safety. If it helps you, perhaps pretend that you are a secret agent on a mission, you’re working undercover and that work requires you to pose as a girl. It’s a role you’re perfectly suited for because only you know best how to put on the facade of being your “deadself”. It’s a short term solution, to be sure, but perhaps it can help you to stay calm and collected while you figure out your plan. Wishing you the best of luck and much support.
I’m being completely serious when I say: foster care
OP this sounds like some cult shit and is actually abuse. Contact child protective services immediately. Rebel against the stupid contract any chance you're not near your parents. Explain everything that's happening to the people you know you can trust. You have to reach out to authorities. If you can get rid or your sick parents, you can get your life back.
Just want to say I hope everything works out for you. You're so strong for getting as far as you have and asking for help. Keep pulling through. I hope you're able to find more supportive guardians.
Contact your current school ASAP and tell them everything. Show them the ""contract"" they're coercing you to sign. This is child abuse.

I'm so sorry this is happening. *Hugs*
check out the Rainbow Railroad. they help remove and relocate persecuted LGBTQIA+ folks!
Contact social services as this is abuse and inform the school you have rights and that contact would not stand in any court! There is help out there
Bruh, you think they send princesses to all girls catholic boarding school? Isn’t that like bad girls away camp? Call their bluff and I bet you’ll have the time of your life at that school if you keep being yourself.
Look my guy, I think that you should tell someone... and if they try to send you there, try staying with one of your friends. Your parents are sick bastards if they force you to be someone that they know will just harm you. I hope you stay safe. I honestly have no words for this... just stay safe, man.
When you're going through hell, keep going! I can't imagine how scared, uncertain, and angry you are right now, but I promise it won't last forever. My dude, eventually you will get to be exactly who you are and love the life you deserve. I'm sorry you're going through this, but just always remember that it is only temporary. Much love my brother.
Fuck your parents, if you need to talk my dms are open, i also have religious transphobic parents so i can relate
Give them an ultimatum. You tell them that they either accept their son or they lose you. If they truly care about you, they’ll try to reason. If not, run, or just power through it. You are the master of your fate, not them. If you want to be a man, you’ll bloody well be one, even if it means breaking your parents’ rules. If you have any family that accepts you, go there. Also, threatening to put them in a shady retirement home rather than taking care of them when the time comes seemed to work for my parents
Call cps. If you can’t, email them, or something. Check their website (whatever the UK equivalent is). Find and reach out to as many hotlines as possible. 
As everyone else here has pointed out, this is basically in breach of human rights at this point. Your best hope is basically to either get as far away as possible from your parents or to get enough protection that they can’t possibly touch you. Change is hard, and this is about as rough as it could get. But I think most people here have read enough transphobe horror stories to know you’ll be safer without them. 

I wish you the best of luck. Stay safe, stay prepared, stay positive in any way you can. 

Above all, remember that you know yourself (and your gender) better than anyone else. Don’t let your parents tell you who you are.
if you want to go scorched earth and lose any relationship with your parents, try finding an LGBTQ+ lawyer (barrister?), see if you can sue to force them to pay to provide your basic needs while you live on your own, at least until youre a legal adult.
I'm not one to tell people to break the rules and sorry for the cussing being said but this is absolute bullshit!! If you are able to, try and keep your male uniform \[if you wear those\] and bind in different ways and just change when you get to school and before you leave school. And also just let them know to deadname and misgender you around your parents. And also call CPS since this is abuse. They can't do shit like that and get away with it. I was changed to Catholic homeschooling after coming out and lost all devices but my computer but, this is terrible! Please find a way to get out of that hell-hole and PLEASE don't sh. I know it will be tempting but you will get though this. You are a strong man and will always be a man.
I am so sorry :/
Be strong dude, you will get through this!
That contract doesn't mean anything legally, and this is probably child abuse too. Are you close to turning 18? If so, maybe you could hold out
Surely you can seek legal advice on this, there would have to be a lawyer that would jump at the opportunity
I’m so sorry you have to put up with that. I wish you the best and I truly hope it gets better. If it helps, just know that I understand what you’re going through and I give you my support 💖 I wish I could provide advice but I’m not one to do that. All I can say is everything is gonna get better, no matter how scary it is now.
How old are you? IDK what the age for this in the UK is, but look into emancipation. Your parents need to lose legal guardianship of you.
I would like to inform you that what is happening here is illegal and your parents are committing a crime. If I were you, I would contact child protective services and possibly the police if anything escalates.
fyi, contracts other than an nda (required to be 13-14 years idr) are not legally binding if signed by a minor. contracts are not above the law and laws broken with in a contract are still subjugated to consequences. just a tidbit of information. what your parents are saying is utter bs, and has no real consequences. This is just a scare tactic from your parents to try to scare you into detransitioning. 

Just keep in mind, KEEP YOURSELF SAFE. CONVERSION THERAPY IN THE UK FOR GENDER IDENTITY HAS STILL NOT BEEN OUTLAWED. If you can, see the signs if they intend to send you to one, and run if necessary. They might forcefully try to get you to attend on of these camps or ""discipline"" you by sending you to military school or those ""training/rehabilitation"" centers.
You are experiencing literal hell. Try to keep as much evidence of your abuse as possible. The 
“contract” they are making you sign is not at all legally binding and cannot be legally or ethically enforced. Try to make and keep as much money as you can so that you can get out of there the moment you turn 18. I’m so sorry you must endure such abuse.
They don't let you sleep in your room? Where do you sleep?
I'm sorry to say that but in this case the only thing possible to do is to have trusted adults (other family members, counselors, teachers, friendly neighbour etc.) and tell them how your parents treat you, what they make you do, how it makes you miserable and suicidal. It might end up being the case that you'll need to inform authorities about the abuse and hope that some trustworthy adult will try to help you and take care of you. I'm so sorry you're being treated like that, I can't imagine how much pain it brings you. I might be wrong, but I really don't thing there's a better option than informing authorities and hope for the best outcome and get supportive adults on your side.
You don’t have to follow this contract. What, they’ll sue you?
Listen, it’s never a “downfall” to be trans. The greatest thing you can possibly be is yourself.
This hurts my heart so much. I can't imagine refusing to love my child regardless of who they were or how they presented. You sound like such a great person who is doing everything ""right."" Smart and kind and good. I can't believe they're taking you for granted. 

If you are worried about living the lie and  losing yourself, just think of people all throughout history like Anne Frank who had to hide their true feelings, religions, or identities. Brave people have always had to do difficult things to survive. Your survival is key here, and it won't be too long before you are an adult and free to be you on your own terms. You shouldn't have to live the lie, and I'm so sorry you are in this situation at all, but if you can stay strong just a little while longer, you can be free and carry on when so many others, like Frank, weren't able to. You can be a silent warrior. You can survive. You can protect others like you wherever you go in these trying times. You can be a hero. You are not alone. Welcome to the resistance.
I am so sorry you have to face this situation at a very young age. We can’t do anything about this situation since you are a minor. Maybe start a gofundme incase you ended up being homeless. I would love to support you a little
Everyone has talked about the legal stuff, the abuse stuff, etc, and I'm sorry you are going through that. But this is what struck me the most:

>i'm scared i'll forget who i am

You won't forget who you are. We all wear masks and change them constantly, pretty much our whole lives. I'm 44 and have never questioned my gender or sexuality, but I still pretend to be someone else a lot of the time. Yours is a bigger burden than most because it is at the core of your identity and you are probably at an age where you are just starting to form your core identity. It is an incredibly rough time even if you aren't dealing with the issues you are. This absolutely fucking sucks, but you can also absolutely get through it. It will get better. There are people out there who will support you.  It is very hard that your family doesn't. It's possibly the worst betrayal. But you can find a new family.
they wouldn't know if you are not wearing girl's attires in school if the teachers and your classmates are willing to help you. you could go to school with another set of clothes and your binder and change into it. The same thing could apply to your name and pronouns. I have never been to a prom as schools here where I live generally don't have that tradition, but i would think prom can work the same way. After you got your phone back, you could try to contact abuse prevention services and get help from your friends. 

rules are only ink on paper. If you don't follow them, they don't exist.
Ok.... so I don't know about the transition thing so I won't speak to that.... but I'd like to offer a bit of advice about your self harm. 

Since you've felt seen and known,  you were able to stop self harming.  That tells me deep in your heart you don't want to hurt yourself.  It also tells me that you have the self control to not do it.  I just want you to know I have confidence that you're strong enough not to go back to it.  

As you get older,  you're going to learn that no matter what,  you are incredibly valuable.  You. Yep, you, right now.  Because of who you are inside.  And you're going to learn that whatever state your body is in,  it's here for your good.  It is an incredibly powerful thing that supports you and who you are. 

All that to say.... treat your body with care. Harming it will mess with your head.  Your body is doing its best to support you.  Help it do that by not harming yourself.  Self harm often brings regret later.  Self care is always the right thing to do.  

I wish you the best and also hope you can come to a mutual understanding with your parents.
Stay true to who you are. Fuck the parents, stay sovereign in your heart space, you are the Christ.
Stars, OP stay safe. Never forget who YOU are during this. Hold onto him tightly. You'll need him when you are happy again.

Keep us updated somehow if you can. I want to know that you're safe...
You should give it some time tbh.
This is heartbreaking and I’m sorry you’re having to deal with this. I don’t know how’s the laws in the uk work, but I do know it is a big world out there. Much bigger than the dungeon in your head your parents are trapping you in. 

Stay strong, brother. One day you will be free to live your life as you please.
i wish you luck, bro
Is there a way to act like you’ve detransitioned at school? Have your teachers use different pronouns around your parents, and hide your clothes/binder in your backpack?

I’m so sorry you have to deal with this. Try to hold on until you can get out of there. Get CPS involved if you feel safe enough to do so. It’ll be ok, brother.
This will probably get lost amongst the other comments: the advice about child protective services is good. Something you may want to consider, though, is telling your parents that they are destroying your relationship with them. You can give in now, but when you move out, they won’t have a child willing to have anything to do with them. 

That might make them want you to leave now, or it might make them reconsider what their goals are in all of this. It’s just another option to consider, especially if CPS mediates a conversation between you and them.
Go to school take the signed ""agreement"" or a photo of it with you. Also show them this post. Ask them to contact child protective services and the police for you.

This is straight up child abuse.
I hope your parents enjoy controlling your gender now because I doubt they'll see you again at 18. Spare yourself and gtfo.
Please contact cps immediately. Tell them what happened, what they demand of you and show them the contract. This is severely abusive and fucked up on so many levels. Op I'm so sorry you're going through this, it's absolutely awful. 
CPS might be able to place you at a protection shelter for LGBTQ+ youth or at the very least become your legal guardian so your parents have no say anymore which school you visit or anything like that
That’s super fucked, I’m sorry, I hope your able to get out asap!
i have a spare bedroom here in brazil in case you need to run away :( your parents do not sound nice, to say the least. much strenght to you, brother. you'll always have us here in transddit supporting you 💙 (love, a mtf girl who had to leave her parents house at 16 y/o and still everything worked out in the end <3 don't lose hope!)
This is child abuse
Please call the police. I’m so sorry man
Please call the police
Babe trans it's not downfall, it's who u are
Just remember, no matter what you will soon be in full command of your life, just a few more years. Not saying don't fight for your rights now, certainly do. But whatever the outcome of that you will ultimately win.
At that point seek help it's that bad
I'm not familiar with uk laws, but not being allowed to sleep in your bedroom?? Is this some harry potter level abuse shit??? Good luck dude, this is terrible...
idk if it's just me being a stupid fucking edgelord but tbh i would fight back, whether it's subtly hiding or outright being violent


not saying you should, if anything you should stay safe and tell another adult
Just FYI, the contract isn’t legal or binding. 

I’m not a lawyer, but this is not possibly a real or enforceable contract. You seem to be worrying about it, but it’s just words on paper, nothing more. I’m not even sure you’re old enough to enter one. And your parents can’t ask these things of you regardless.
Try to ask for counseling/psychotherapy from a professional you can both agree upon. I realize this isn’t exactly accessible to every family.       
       
Self harm is not something that should be easily dismissed, regardless of how you cope with it. The fact is that many people struggle either less, the same, or even more, and don’t self harm.         
       
Worst case scenario you trade expression for practical essentials/comforts and receive professional help to manage your emotions. Im assuming you don’t have to live with or by your parents forever.        
Many children don’t gain opportunities to express themselves cis or trans. That’s actually the norm for being a teenager. You shouldn’t strive to peak in high school but instead your adulthood.
A contract signed under duress is not valid.  
It's literally just your parents saying ""do this, or else"" but on paper.  
It's fucked up, and I'm sorry your parents can't accept you.
my guy that is literal abuse. if they’re abusing you over that, they dont deserve you, not one bit. just reading this made me PISSED, that people have the AUDACITY TO REJECT THEIR OWN CHILDREN FOR WHO THEY WANT TO BE. IT JUST BHVJHFJG&DJYFVJYGVKHFDNFDJGFDJGFSJGFCKJGVLJHGKHGDJHFDAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Call the fucking police
1)Phone your local council and speak to the social service department they will look into getting you somewhere safe if need be (2) if things get really bad please phone or email childline 08001111 and they will try and put you in touch with people who can help you
Save up money, go work summer jobs, MAKE SURE YOUR PARENTS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE ACCOUNT THE MONEY IS IN, look for flats you can move in perhaps with a roommate and tge day you turn 18 pack your things and leave
Could you inform your teachers that your situation at home is abusive, and you want them to call you by your preferred name, but they'll have to use your birth name on all paperwork and when speaking to your parents? 
Do you have friends you can trust to keep referring to you correctly when you're away from your parents?
Is there a place at school like a locker where you can keep a binder or alternative clothes?

This sounds like a truly horrible situation. Are there other family members like grandparents that are supportive who you could stay with? Or a friend whose parents would be willing to take you in?

No matter what, please put your safety first. Try to find yourself a support system whether it be friends at school or groups online (when you do have access). I would advise having minimal contact with your parents (speak to them when spoke to or if you need something from them, but not to go out of your way to interact with them) as much as you can get away with doing that. You don't want to upset them because it will just harm you further. 

You won't forget who you are. You are completely valid, and your parents are wrong. If you feel yourself going through a hard time mentally, there are crisis limes for lgbt people you can call and text (I think they vary by country, and I'm not sure which ones are in the UK). And remember that this is temporary. You will be able to be yourself freely. It will happen, it's just going to be difficult to get there.
Isnt this abuse
Get copies of the ""contract"". Bring a few to school and tell your guidance counselors. This is absolutely abuse, and you absolutely need adult intervention,  because your parents are endangering your safety and well-being.
You might want to talk to a councilor or someone you trust at your current school. Or maybe at a government organisations, maybe a local lgbtqia support group can point you in the right direction, also considering finding someone in the government that isn't biased against you. This is a very scary step but the way you family is treating you is at a point that is clearly abusive.
I don’t think I have anything else that hasn’t already been said by others in the comments, but I’ll leave this here to let you know that you deserve better and are valid 💛
Brother, this is abuse. You are being abused. You are In danger, and I understand that you need to focus on your survival. Document everything, upload what you can to a separate Google cloud. Contact charities based around LGBTQ issues. Find help online, lord knows I can't give it. You are being abused. You did nothing wrong. YOU DID NOTHING WRONG. Please. Stay safe, don't cut contact with people you trust. If you have pocket money get to Tesco, buy a cheap ass burner phone and a PAYG sim card. And keep it secret. You can get tiny ones. That's your backup. Stay safe. You did nothing wrong.
This is abuse. Ask for help from school.
https://www.childline.org.uk
This is fucking evil and abuse. Obviously getting away from the situation is best bet, many a relative? 

There are good charities that will be able to give you the best advice: Stonewall and The Trevor Project spring to mind, also citizens advice for any legal stuff like emancipation.
I just wanna talk to them


*racks shotgun*


I just wanna talk to them
I can’t do much but you have to knows that there allways gonna be sommone in the community for you and one day you’r gonna be release of that shit just don’t loose fate
Bro, this is illegal here.  Contact the police or social services **now**.  End this asap.  

File for Emancipation.  Details here: https://www.nspcc.org.uk/keeping-children-safe/in-the-home/moving-out/
or at least threaten to if they keep this shit up.

Are they christian?  If so: **1 Timothy 5:8** *""But those who won’t care for their relatives, especially those in their own household, have denied the true faith. Such people are worse than unbelievers.""* and this link: https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-transgender-people

Contracts signed by kids aren't binding and especially not contracts signed under duress.  Don't let them hold this contract over you, you know full well you don't agree with it's wording, your signature means nothing on that worthless piece of paper.
That ""contract"" is not legal. Your parents cannot say ""we'll give you these basic rights which we already need to give to you if you sign this paper"" plus the fact that you are forced to sign it also invalidates it
can i suggest that you tell your friends and teachers about the situation? they will help give advice, especially the teachers, and support better than us strangers on the internet. they could call you by your chosen name and pronouns when you’re at school and your parents aren’t around, but if your parents are around then they can go back to deadnaming and misgendering you? you could give your friends some of your boy clothes and then when you go to their houses/on days out together they could bring the clothes for you to change into, or keep a boys uniform and you can change into it at school. your parents will have no way of knowing (as far as i’m aware they aren’t monitoring you), the contract isn’t legally binding it’s just a form of control, *if they don’t respect you then you don’t have to respect them or their contract*. 

i’m so so sorry you’re going through this, i know it all seems really hard right now but i promise with time it will get better. it sounds like you’ll be 18 in a few years, and at that point they can do nothing, you can move out to uni and unis are excellent at handling trans kids (in my experience). it absolutely does get better, you just have to keep holding on and keep pushing. already you’re asking for help and advice and that’s great! keep the ones who love you close and use them to push through this because you absolutely can.
Just thinking what I might do as a minor being forced to go against themselves to dangerous levels. This is definitely considered child abuse in the UK. I'm sorry I don't know the legislation or whatever but it is all available online. It would be amazing if you have a trusted and supportive adult to help advocate for you. If you could go to them and tell them what your parents are doing, how's it's not legal and you'd like to get yourself access to help. I wonder if it might be worth contacting childline or even better Mermaids as they may be able to signpost you. You could even look for a lawyer who was willing to help you. There are plenty of trans lawyers out there who had unsupportive parents and would love to take such a case. I would start talking to everyone I could think of. Write to your local MP, the mayor, police, church. I would lean on the fact that forcing a child in such a way could cause them take their own life and what will these community pillars do to ensure the safety of minors in their towns. You could also take to local social media and newpapers, but obviously that depends how much you're willing to have others know. But fight this. The way they are treating you is not that of loving parents, despite what they may believe.   


Definitely do a tonne of research, get a support network and don't take this. Sounds like foster care would end up being on the cards. I truly hope you find your community.
Take a copy of the contract to your school and ask for advice or help if your school is supportive Thay may be able to get you help maybe a social worker as I'm sure this is a form of abuse in the UK. And if forced to Singh contract are instantly voide as you are not willingly singing it
As others have pointed out, that's a clear case of abuse.

If you've completed your A levels I'd hazard a guess you're 16/17, so your possible options may change when you become 18.

Contact NSPCC, explain your situation and they'll be able to give you help and advice regarding your safeguarding as a child.

Contact Mind for mental health advice, get an understanding of CBT as a way of mitigating the current and incoming stress.

Contact Shelter they may be able to provide advice about emancipation from your parents and housing. (Citizen advice bureau will be able to advise on the process)

There should be a DSL (dedicated Safeguarding Lead) at your school they should have training / experience in supporting children in similar situations, they should be able to provide advice on what services your council can provide.

If I were in your position, I'd want to make a plan that sets out all the actions that need to happen to get out of that situation and into a significantly less harmful situation. Without knowing more about your situation, living independently seems like best goal for you to plan for.
Talk to a different adult. Whether that is anyone from your school or anywhere else. Someone you are comfortable with. This IS CHILD ABUSE. So many times abuse goes unnoticed or you don't know it is abuse until years later. The other adult has to report this. And then hopefully CPS (or whatever the equivalent is in the UK) can step in. At least here in the US all teachers have yearly mandatory reporter training for abuse.
This is such an awful thing you are experiencing, being punished for being who you are is unconscionable. Hang in there and don’t let them get the best of you. I’ve been surrounded by mostly unsupportive family, but your situation is far more heartbreaking. If you have to weather the storm by playing along it’s understandable and doesn’t take away from who you really are. Don’t give up hope, bright days are ahead, never give up. You’ll find a way. We are here to support you through these dark days. Stay strong dude.💜
I'm so sorry
Do you have a counsellor at the school you could speak to? Or a teacher you trust? You need to get an adult in your corner to help you.
WHAT THE FUCK THAT IS STRAIGHT UP ABUSE.
HOW OLD ARE YOU HOLY SHIT I HOPE YOU GET OUT OF THAT HELLHOLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND CUT THEM OFF OF YOUR LIFE FOREVER.
I don't know about the UK law, but there has to be a way to stop this from happening. This cannot be legal
Go to your school & show the contract to a teacher you trust. Work with them to write out everything thst's gone on at home / is going on at home, all of the threats your parents have used to make you act / behave / present the way they want you to, and everything you're scared eill happen going forward now. If possible, also write out some situations which you see as proof of what will happen if you comply / if you don't comply. Then when you have support from your school  (& possibly a parent / guardian of a friend who is supportive of you if that's an option), reach out or have someone reach out to social services. That ""contract"" and the list are proof of abuse, and if your parents say that yes those situations happened or yes XYZ happened or will happen, it's a basic legal ground for them to lose custody of you. Legally, social services have to respect your name & gender when putting you with a foster family / temporary family *(meaning they can't knowingly put you with a family who are transphobic or anti-lgbt, since that counts as knowingly putting you in danger)*



I'm really sorry that this is the only advice I've got for you.
Dude just call cps and say goodbye
Dude. That's abuse. You need to contact child protective services because that is literally abuse. Stay safe man.
(Warning: memtion of self-harm but by no means a invitation to do so)

Show this story and a copy of the ""contract""  to a teacher/ school admin you belief to have your best interest at heart. If your trust is not misplaced then they will hel you protect yourself and get out of there. They should have the means by money, telephone, internet ans social connections to do soo.

At the very least maybe there is a way to socially shame your parents into not acting on their beliefs (like spread the rumor that they plan to send you away to make you kill yourself. So now they can't send you away because they will be know by everyone as the parents that killed their kid the moment you disappear to a catholic school) . Social pressure can do alot some times. Which is ofcourse a temporarely solution before you have the money making means to live on your own and cut them out of your life.
Show the contract to any trusted adults at the school that you can and ask them to help you. By law, they have to escalate it. That’s child abuse. Do you have access to email?
Hey. Just some quick advise because you're going through shit right now and I'll try my absolute best to help you dude. First of all, that is ABUSIVE AS FUCK. Taking away your property rights and not letting you sleep in your bed is abuse. Forcing you to detransition is abuse. Those people don't love you, nor care about you. The love the idea of a daughter just like they want her to be. You are not that, man. Im sorry if this too harsh. PLEASE, tell your friends and your teachers and WHOEVER you can. Call child protective servises. Do you have any supportive family you feel safe with? They would be great help. Just like some other comments said, that contract does not bind you in any legal way, and they do not have the right to make you follow it. Maybe what you could do for a little while is tell your teachers and friends to not call you by your name when your parents are around. You could even year a girls uniform when you leave home and have your own in your bag to change when you get to school. DO NOT let those people stray you from your identity. You are a man, and no matter how hard they try, you will always be one. Please try your best to not harm yourself, even though that must be extremely hard, because it will just make your mental health worse. Try to also hide any money that you get. They will not win. I wish you the best dude, be safe and remember: you are a man. I hope you escape as soon as possible and live your life to the fullest
What’s your name?  
( your name not the one your parents gave to you)
this is child abuse?? bro call the police like holy shit. this is disgusting you can't let this happen to you
Hear me out - I promise I’m not trolling here; 
Take this opportunity to research the catholic school.  Some ( not all ) are support it ive if the LGBTQ community here in the UK.  You could,  anomnysly ahead of time also reach out and explain the situation.  

Do not open yourself to Doxing by releasing you identity,  but you can absolutely piss your parents off in this scenario if it happens to be one of the supporting schools ( which I think by law they need to, too some level here in the UK )
I don’t understand how parents can do this and this is why I say trans people are some of the strongest you can come out and your parents may not support you it is terribly that they are doing this to you but karma comes around contact child protection services if they cant accept you as the man you want to be then they don’t deserve you
How are the laws in your country, UK? I know that in Canada (at least some provinces, idk, I'm not Canadian) not being supportive or at least accepting of your child's transition is considered child abuse and police/Children's Help line/CPS/whatever it's called can get you helped out into the foster kid system or if you're older to live by yourself and have your essentials covered by government funds. That honestly might be better since they are planning on taking away your privacy which often is covered in law as a ""kids between ages 10 to 18 can share a room with children of max 2 years of age difference and of the same sex and must sleep in separate beds"" (not word for word from Finnish law, I just remember hearing that sometime). Look into it, good luck dude.
Incriminate them both for som crime that gets both of them jailed.
Listen to your parents. They are correct.
What the absolute fuck is this?

Child protective services, Lgbt charities, go full British an contact your MP.
RUN OP RUN
This is 100% abuse you should definitely get some authorities involved like childline
Call CPS. Don't put it off. You are not obligated to respect, listen to, or even love your parents.
Your parents just wrote an admission of abuse. They created a paper trail. It is up to you now to bring the contract to a trusted adult.
Report them, what they're doing equates to child abuse.

They don't sound fit to parent.
I would look into organizations that help Trans kids and see if you can get them for abuse. It seems like absolute abuse to do what they are doing. 

Also if you’re old enough you might be able to just move out and live your own life legally. It will be hard and you’ll prolly have to get a job while finishing school, but it’s up to you whether you think that would be a better option. 

Either way, do some research and talk to everyone you can who supports Trans rights and see what can be done to help you. 

I wish you the best of luck and even though I don’t have kids, I’m prolly as old as your parents and they sound like they are absolute pieces of shit who don’t care or love you like parents should. They forced you into this world without any choice and now want to control you because they don’t like what you have become. Well that’s too fucking bad for them and maybe they should have thought about that before having a kid. You are an individual, not their property.
Ahh, yeah thats really rough man. I'd start looking about it any of your friends parents will support you through highschool. Then get you a job and grind until you're secured. Then you can bust into your parents home in a tux and spit on the floor and flip them the bird before you walk out of their lives for however long you want.
I'm in a different country from you so this is hypothetical entirely but if my kid's friend was going through this, I'd do everything I could to bring them to live with me where they could be themselves. I also know a lot of other people who would give you a home until you finished school in a heartbeat. My guess is there is at least someone in your circle of friends and acquaintances who is willing and able to do the same. If you can let as many people as you can know what is going on, you are likely to find out who that is. Although many people here are recommending speaking to the police, they aren't always as helpful or sympathetic to this kind of abuse as they should be. Better would be to start with your guidance councillor, friends' parents, and any LGBTQ organisation your school can help you contact, just telling them everything you've said here.
I haven't seen this advice here yet so, as a 29 year old who hated life under my parents roof, here it is:

Focus your mind on moving out once you're an adult. I recommend going to university as soon as you finish your A levels, and going as far away from your parents as you can. Being far away gives you an easy excuse not to visit them often. Your student loans will keep you going for a good few years. Get a part time job while you're at uni, in a supermarket or something. Meet some good people who you can continue to be housemates with after uni. Introduce yourself as male from day one and be the real you.

Importantly, try your hardest not to rely on your parents' money for anything. If you can be financially independent, they can't use money as a weapon against you. My dad tried that. I chose to live in a damp, rat-and-cockroach-infested student house rather than ask my dad for a penny. And you know what? I was happier for it.

You will one day be free to be yourself without your parents controlling you. Whenever you feel really low, just remember that. You're so close to freedom. Hang in there!
I’m pretty sure this is not legal, they literally can’t force you to detransition
This is 100% abuse and you should contact the police about it, but for a more temporary solution leave a binder at school/in your bag. They don’t know what goes on at school, you can continue to present as a boy, just let people know to refer to you as your deadname if you’re around your parents
If you get on well at school you should speak to a trusted member of staff, it would be their professional and legal obligation to raise it as a major safeguarding issue. The school will mostly likely have a safeguarding portal where this would be raised to the schools designated safeguarding lead. Depending on what level of risk they deem you at (for example, the highest being immediate risk to safety or life), other services potentially will get involved, such as social services or police


Also I'm sure it's been covered but that contract (legally speaking) means fuck all

EDIT: Im not saying things will get this bad, but just to have in mind, akt (formerly Albert Kennedy trust) are a UK homeless charity for LGBT+ youth
You need to tell the school this. You definitely need to. They may be able to help and support you with it or get the needed people involved too.
UK?

try r/legalAdviceUK/ They are very good at pointing out the best resources to contact, and very good at putting stuff in language accessible for young people.

There are options and I have a strong feeling your parents might not be living up to their legal obligations to protect your welfare.

Even in a boarding school the school has the obligation not to discriminate against you on the basis of gender identity, and have basic safeguarding obligations. Which could be very interesting if it's girls school, since, y'know, you're a boy.

There's a lot of bigots in the world, sadly, but there are also a lot of people willing and able to help.
A boy being sent to an all girl's school, if it want to the situation that would be a dream. 

With life you'll never forget who you are. It will only grow stronger with time.
Your in the uk. How old are you you know they cant just do that to you i would get that documentat and go to the police
Rip
Youre a minor so contract isn't legally binding so no need to follow it. Contact the police, CPS, whatever cause this is straight up abuse and illegal as fuck.
Play your parents game to their face, and start planning in secret to get out as fast as possible. Continuing to live with them will only get worse, regardless of which pronouns you use. They don’t respect you, and they’ve made it clear that they only love the idea of who you were, but not you as a human being in front of them suffering 

Look for shelters or nonprofits that provide resources to 🏳️‍🌈 teens. Start calling people at those places, you’ll find more people who want to help you than you may realize, they might have been where you are now 15 yes ago and will know more about your local options

You are who you are, and your parents have shown you that they
What the hell this is incredibly cruel how do people ... how can anyone ever do this to their child it's sick
You should browse less leftist propaganda
People are suggesting reporting to child services. I would also suggest reaching out to any relatives you have who might be supportive or at least less terrible than your parents. Grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, older siblings, etc. Also potentially reach out to some of your friends’ parents if you have a close relationship with them. 

1. Having adults on your side can sometimes help in legal situations.

2. If the legal system ends up removing you from your parents care, you will likely need a new legal guardian as a minor. The foster care system is a crapshoot, you could get lucky and get some great foster parents, but there’s also plenty of bad/abusive foster parents. If you have caring adults in your life, that will almost certainly be a better option, and you can advocate to be placed in their care.
RIOT RIOT RIOT RIOT
There's nothing you can possibly do to illuminate the truth to a bunch of monsters. The best you can hope to do is outlive the senile motherfuckers.
So what happens when someone’s a tomboy do they treat them like that too
Bring this up with your school. Beg your teachers and and friends to help do something about this. I know the UK is kinda TERF Island but there's bound to be someway for you to fight back and get out from under your family's thumb.

You made the right choice, by doing this you still have access to your safest place, and at least it's you doing this to yourself rather than it being forcefully done to you. It's not much but it's something. You'll make it thru this.
My oldest two are tranz and I could not fathom the pain you are in from being treated like this from your parents. I hope someday they remember how to be parents for you and I hope you find someone near you who can understand and care for you till they do. I send you a big hug and wish you peace , but remember they cannot change who you are inside you!
All I can say is, don't rush to identify yourself as this or that. All self identifications are transitory and our view of ourselves and the world around us are in a constant state of change. Seek to explore inwardly so that you may catch a glimpse of your true self which is beyond such arbitrary and superficial definitions related to gender, body type, beliefs, likes, etc. You are not who you think you are so long as you feel the need to put yourself in a categorical box of identity. If what you claim yourself to be changes day by day (or month by month, or year by year), which is almost guaranteed to be the case, then that is not who you are. Seek to find that which is permanent, beyond all impressions of body and mind. It is there, and if you look in all earnestness you will be sure to find it. And then all of your problems will come to an end.
Everyone's got good advice for you so I'm just here with support

You will not ""forget"" who you are. For the same reason that ""who you are"" didn't feel right to begin with. 

You will have every opportunity, once you are free of your parents, to be the person you resonate with, learn who that person is and learn to love that person

You will live a life full of good music and good food and happiness and laughter and new friends, without your parents, so long as you keep moving forward.

The only thing your parents can affect is how you feel about them, and how you interact with them. Hopefully after this, you will soon have the option of NOT interacting with them.

Keep your head down for now, and keep moving forward. There are people out in the world who love you, and people who will love you.

I believe in you
Your parents made you sign a contract to be treated equally to your sibling and sleep in your own room? They could (and should) go to prison for this, show that contract to someone at your school
Replying late but really do contact child protective services as they are literally threatening you and I’m pretty sure there are laws against this type of discrimination
Talk about indoctrination, like Holy fuck that is all heart breaking to hear.

your parents don't love you, no loving parent put there personal beliefs over their child happiness.

I don't like in the uk so I don't know what you have access to but if there is a teen group home you can go to or a friend you can stay with do it.

get as far away from them as soon possible.
in the meantime find ways to explore and reaffirm you identity when and where you can. find friends who respect your pronouns and wont rat you out, wear the close you want when you aren't near them, or even underneath your other clothing if you can. anything to keep your sanity intact untill you can get them out of your life.

hope that helps in some way. sorry you have to go through this.
I assume sending you to the all-girls school would cost them money, yes?  I say let them send you, but nothing says you have to be cooperative or compliant at the school.  Only respond to your chosen name and pronouns, ignore any and all instructions that do not recognize you for who you are, cut your hair the way you want (or just shave it off completely and go punk), Talk about atheism or non-christian theology at the school, basically just get yourself expelled.  

The other option is to attempt to put it all back into the box, ""do your time"", then get out and never look back.  Both are not easy and either way, you will still be there on the other side.  You just have to survive. \*hugs\*
CPS now
Call fucking child prozective services. This is straight up abuse
Go to your teachers and headteacher and show the contract - they will likely continue calling you by your new name, but maybe not in front of your parents

You may also be able to store trousers at the school and change when you get there. 

The teachers might also contact someone to help you on your behalf. Without you doing anything “wrong” by your parents (they did tell you to explain to your teachers to call you another name - the teachers concern is their responsibility)

How many years do you have left? I moved away to uni at 18 - 10/10 would recommend
I'm sorry to hear this dude.

I hope that you can find some safe adults to help you navigate your legal options. Maybe a safe teacher, other family member, parent of a friend, GP, therapist?

Signing a contract like that as a child is just theatrics/make believe, so don't worry about it. 

Unfortunately the UK is so fucked up for trans kids now, that you can't physically transition until you're an adult. So they can mess with your social life but it won't affect your ability to medically transition as soon as possible.

This situation will pass. I know it can feel like the end of the world right now, but nothing will stop you living your life as an adult. No matter what happens now you will have decades ahead of you living normally as a guy. 

I hope you can safely get out of this situation now. But if you can't, I hope you have school friends who will get that you're a dude no matter what you have to tell your parents. Try to get through school, escape to uni, be your true self and never look back.
Ngl if i was in that position i would either be dead or in jail for murder.
Tbh, a school where a bunch of queer girls get sent might be a more supportive environment than your parents are providing. I’d make a contract for them to sign that just says something like “By invalidating my child’s identity I forfeit a positive future relationship, and fully expect to be left in a home to rot when I need care that is expected of family.”
We love you, be strong 🖤🖤🖤🧛🏻
Is there any other family members you can convince to take you in? When my family was doing stuff like this I honestly just started being the worst person, keeping my grades just barely at passing so I would still graduate, skipping school, running away. 

If they’ve already taken everything that brings you joy then you don’t have anything to lose at that point. Make them hate you, convince another family member to take you in who will allow you to be yourself. Honestly that might be shitty advice but I think you should try to do whatever you can to get yourself out of that environment ASAP because they’re just gonna continue to make you miserable and I know it would be horrible for me to handle as a child
Sweetheart, that contract is nothing but hot air. Your parents are abusive, straight up. Being Trans isn't a choice - If they can't accept you, that's one thing. But for them to force you to do something that makes you suicidal is abuse. 

Are there any adults at your school you can trust? I think, though this is going to be hard and you're going to have to be brave, what's best for you is to leave. Take everything you own and need, and find an adult who you trust at your school who will take you seriously. 

You have to tell them everything, even about your prior suicidal thoughts. They need to understand your parents are abusing you, and that you can't go back. Ask them to call the police or social services if you need to. Do you have any friends who could back you up too? 

I'm in the UK also, and recently at a Pride event I saw a Homeless LGBT Charity - I don't remember their name, but maybe they can help you find some secure housing?

Good luck, I'm so sorry your parents are awful. :(
these people are threatening your safety. that is abuse, period. *even if* we assume the absolute best of them, and that they think they're doing the right thing, if they're willing to *compromise your* ***saftey*** and threaten stripping you of *basic human dignaties* that it's their fucking ***job*** to provide you with in the first place- just to do what they think is best for you... thats still fucking abuse, there's no way to look at it where it isn't straight up abuse, even with the most generous and undeserved benefit of the doubt.

talk to your school about what to do exactly, they sound like they'll actually try to help you. Idk legally exactly what you can do bc I'm not educated and I live in the US, but there *has* to be something you can do, so talk to them about it. I'm sure child protective services would love to see this contract they had you sign. 

*(btw unless uk is super weird which I'm 99.99% sure it's not, you can't just write a contract and have someone sign away just anything. that contract is meaningless legally, if anything it's hard proof that you're being abused.)*

Wishing you the absolute best bro <3333333
Wtf is that even legal what your parents are doing? I wonder if citizen's advice can work for you mate. I'd call what they're doing to you as abuse.

I'd tell your school what you're going through. This is just insane abuse.
First, that contract was under duress, so it's not legally binding. Second do you have any friends or adult allies? I would stay with them instead, if possible. I don't think it is safe for you to continue living and interacting with your parents. Third maybe you can report them for neglect or abuse. Fourth, if you have any LGBTQIA+ Centers in your area that can help, have a friend or teacher take you there, so they can help you. Maybe these centers have resources for LGBTQIA+ youth to live on their own with assistance. And fifth, you need to get a job, depending how old you are and the laws involving that. If these jobs ask for a guardian signature, that have an adult ally or member of the community sign it instead. The quicker you can become independent, the quicker you can move away from your parents and live as your authentic self. The way you talk about this, it sounds you need to get out of dodge real quick or you might do something to yourself that you'll regret or can't take back. Also here is a link to a channel that has helped me and others in the LGBTQIA+ community. This channel is educational and gives great advice. Just keep it muted at home and turn the captions on since your parents are transphobic. https://youtube.com/c/PoweredByRainbows

Also is your brother an Ally? Maybe he has some resources to help you too. I hope all of this helps. And please keep us updated on your journey.
I dont have any productive advice that hasn't been already said so I just want to wish you well and remind you as others have that you will always be a guy, whether your parents like it or not, whether you're presenting it or not. Your life as a trans boy has inherent value, and your inner strength has been proven by the fact that you're still here and you're still trans, even in these dire circumstances. I know you can make it. Good luck.

And PS, if you ever get the opportunity, please update us on this post. I wanna know when you're finally safe. Don't be afraid to post a PayPal or other exchange app link if you need financial support.
This is an insane amount of abuse, if your able to you need to leave
I sincerely hope things work out for you, they sound disgusting and I'm sorry you have gone through it.

My advice is if worse comes to worst, and you need to detransition in school, leave home everyday as if you're following their wishes, and bring a spare change of clothes and a binder to change into at school. 

If you do this, make sure you have a fabric or book to act as a false bottom or some hidden pocket in your bag so if they're ever suspicious and decide to check your bag, it won't be as easy as them just opening it. 

Good luck fr
Bro my heart broke again and again reading that. I’m sorry I don’t have any advice, if you want someone else to rant to or use as an idea sounding board then I’m here for you. Don’t give up and work on getting what you need to live independently from your shitty spawn point and semen donator. I love you, I think your 100% valid, and I am optimistic that you can survive this. You got this Brother.
Deal with it. Its 3 or 4 more years... NOT A LIFE TIME>

Get good Grades and Plan your escape. 

get such good grades that you can get a scholarship and get out, or Join the military straight out of HS...

It sucks, but in some countries you'd be dead already...

keep the faith till then... IT WILL GET BETTER.

&#x200B;

On a lighter note, keep a journal religiously... everything thing.

And when your free, publish it and out your parents...
the school will understand if you explain to them, especially once you explain how awful your parents are. i’m so so sorry
This absolutely horrible and I’m so sorry that you have to deal with these “parents”. The most I can really say here is, try to find as many coping mechanisms as you can to try and help you through this. Whether that’s music, games, art, just something to help. And try to make it through until you can move out. Once you move out and have your own income, they can’t tell you what to do. And if need be, you can cut contact with them, or at least for a bit to help your mental health.
Is there a way you can contact child protective services? Would they be supportive in your area? What about LGBT support groups for teens?
This is the case in the US, and I don’t know if this is true in the UK, but if you’re a minor and sign a contract, it’s not legally binding, so you can freely break your end of the deal.
Report them to the police
If you live in the UK what county??
They are a bunch of jerks. I'd sign it but keeping being yourself as safely as possible. Once you hit 18 nope out of there and transition
Honestly, I might…

A. talk to your school about what is going on - I’m a teacher and occasionally I/other teachers/the schools I’ve worked for have been able to provide a safe space for trans students to be themselves at school and we just use their deadname/pronouns when we communicate with the parents or on official documents. (Not every school I’ve worked for has done this, but it’s worth asking)

B. contact the boarding school they’re threatening to send you to - they may be more supportive than your parents think (I work at a Catholic school right now and we have a gay chaplain and a great GSA club). They may not, but if you find out that they’d be supportive, it may be a better option to just go there. I know people who went to boarding school and loved it.
Honestly fuck yo family if they can't support you for who you are than dip don't get why care for the people are so God damn f****** judgmental when it comes to like trans people it's crazy as hell to think that someone would throw their own child out just because who they are keep your head up and stay blessed
So agree with all the advice and that your family is abusive. I wanted to add as someone who has also been abused: you don’t deserve this. Nothing can justify this, even if you were a “bad” kid and acted out, you still would t deserve this. No one deserves this treatment. And I am so sorry that you are being abused but also that you are being deprived of the unconditional love, support, and connection that you deserve and have a right to. It is absolutely not fair. I promise you though that even if it seems impossible it will get better. There are people who will love you for everything you are. Who will prioritize your needs, comfort, and happiness. You will find them. It will be hard but this is when you gotta white knuckle it and hold on for dear life so you can get there. Im so sorry that this is the situation you are in but it is NOT forever. Keep hoping and dreaming and hold on to the possibilities of the future.
Wtf? This is not borderline gaslighting, it's gaslighting, making you sing a contract to not be yourself so ""you can be happy"" is not love, it's a fear of losing control

Do they actually have a way of monitoring what your friends call you? If not, screw it, tell them you asked you friends to deadname you, but don't chang anything with your friends

If they do have a way to do it, you can try a nickname you like, i hed a similar situation on a much smaller scale, i had my friends call me ""the snail"" for months, cus my dad can't handel me being trans (thay call me my name now, but it kind of stuck)  

Anyway, spend as little time at home as possible for you, stay at friend's houses, after school stuff, find excuses to go out

And my last advise, it's a bit harsh, but gaslight them back. I'm not going to sugar cote it, I think that if they are that controlling and closed minded as to make you sing that contract, you should stop caring what the fuck they want, cus it's clear they don't care what you want, so lie, for your own safety for the time being, until you can get the fuck away from them, how ever long it takes, let your friends know you as how you really are, and lie to the monsters

I really hope you find a way out of this mess ASAP, remember, you are absolutely valid and deserving of love
If you feel it is necessary contact your local child protective agency because these are threats to you mental well being from your parents and their actions are potentially damaging to you.
Hey OP, I've read through all of the comments and I'm glad you've taken the first steps to getting out of there. You're really fucking brave for doing that, I could never. Please keep me updated if you can, your situation really concerns me. And from one transmasc to another, you got this. The best advice I can give you right now is to not give up. You have everything on the line right now. The UK is on your side, go as far as you need to legally. This is severe abuse and the UK will not tolerate it. Please get rid of your 'parents' and don't take shit from anyone. Keep poking and prodding and making calls until someone gets you out of there. That contract cannot legally bind you because of your age and situation, as well as the fact that it is under threat and coercion. Please stay safe and keep fighting ❤
Hi boy I'm a trans girl.
I have no words for your situation.
If i could give some advice I would say that:

1 the world Is unfair, but you are an extremely precious human being
2 unfortunately in this moment of your life you are living with your parents. And willingly or not they are your launch platform for your future.
We are still teenagers, and we are going to live a beautiful and long life. There is no need to rush, especially in your situation. Try to get all the strength and the good this moment of your life Is giving you. As soon as you become indipendent, you will be free to be what you are. 
Play your cards, stay out of troubles and this bad page will fade

Emma❤️
Try explaining to your friends what's going on and tell them only to use your dead name around your parents. If you feel safe to try telling one of your teachers what's going on and see if they can be of any help for your situation.
You're a minor, the contract means nothing and you can completely legally void it.
“My only downfall is I’m trans”

My heart just cracked. I came to this community as a parent of a child who has struggled with identity, and I didn’t know how to navigate that road. I came here to listen and learn. I never comment because I’m learning from everyone else, who is living their own life. This however is where I just can’t. You are amazing and strong and don’t deserve this. You are a child, and you are so worthy of happiness. Your parents are failing you. Your happiness is so much more important than their comfort levels. I have no advice for you, but I’d LOVE to dish some out to the people who are raising you. 

Please be kind to yourself. You are worthy of all the happiness. ALL. OF. IT.
Bring this to a news channel
Wondering how OP is doing now. Any news?

I agree you are experiencing abuse and neglect. While the contract thing sounds illegal, parents make “agreements” with their kids all the time. I don’t think the legality of it is a concern for them, it’s just a way to further coerce you.

Consider whether you trust the police before doing anything. Like, don’t call the cops first. You call the cops if someone broke into your house. They are barely able to do anything that doesn’t involve property crimes, even then they don’t have a great track record.

Telling a teacher you trust is a good step. If you have an extended family member that’s supportive you could maybe stay with them, definitely tell them, or if you have a friend whose parents are trustworthy as well. If you spread the information widely of your abuse and neglect it will no longer be your secret to have to deal with, rather, you’ll be protected by a community that views the behaviour of your parents as cruel. They seem very concerned with what others think.

Sometimes the laws and organizations out there can be protective but sometimes they can make things worse and that’s always the fear. If you don’t have to bring the law into it and can just leave and stay with another adult your parents might stop. At a safe distance you can begin pursuing things like emancipation or choosing other legal actions. The important thing is getting out to a safer environment. The thing is the law is slow and non profits don’t have a lot of money, but they will try to help you. You just need to have a few options and not solely rely on non profits and the law. Realistically, you may need to learn how to get things you need by being a bit scrupulous. If you came out at school already you know you’re strong, these parents are merely annoying inconveniences on your way to growing up.

If you choose to follow the so called contract to survive you won’t forget who you are. I’m not suggesting you do this, but I also understand if you do go that route. I rather like the suggestion one person had of just changing at school, that kind of thing, but I know that’s not for everyone and the goal post of what’s acceptable will constantly change if your parents are already doing that by treating you worse than your brother. Stay safe.
Maybe try and see if there’s any legal avenue through the UK’s equivalent of child protective services? Considering you guys actually have protections for trans people in place where you live your government may take your side.
It’s a scary time to be a parent. I’m trans and a mom so I have both perspectives. They are afraid they aren’t protecting you from irreversible damage and there are only two ways to find out. Maybe give them some science on how rare it is to regret or want to detrans if You don’t have any other comorbid diagnosis . Like autism, delusions, anorexia etc.  This is their worry. That they are supporting the wrong treatment and it might be irreversible. Go with the science and address that worry. Hopefully You find a place where both your needs are met. Lastly, don’t self harm or commit suicide. If You feel any of that coming on get help. One day, this will all pass and Yiu need to be there for that life. Best best love to you. -Tiff
If it’s like america the catholic school will keep you because they getting paid.   Be away be out with friends.  Get away from parents
except i will probably be sent to this school if i disobey it which sounds like absolute hell
And it’s completely invalid as 16 year olds can’t sign anything legally
My man, that is cult behavior. I would love to tell you to leave but I know the reality. I know how hard it can be. This person is right tho. It’s severe abuse. Stay safe, pal. 💕
@whoever gave this the laughing award, fuck u
[removed]
thanks friend
Agreed OP should talk with his school because there is clearly a form of abuse, intimidation and blackmail
Yes, UK schools (all of them) have safeguarding obligations. They should be able to escalate this to the appropriate authorities.
this. absolutely this. that's literally child abuse
Agreed. Contact services to help and definitely show the photo you took to your school counselor.
AGREED  look I'm somewhat able to help you mentally not in court
Unfortunately you signed a contract If they haven't abused you whatsoever then technically they would completely win in court AKA juridistic options need to be avoided(<-- only applies if the contract is legal), (I'm MTF so I've looked into this + my dad is a lawyer that doesn't support LGBTQ+ so I hear cases like this somewhat about 1 a year that's how I K this). Police however is a great option if you specifically file in for Domestic abuse. Also IK you're not aloud to talk or research about LGBTQ+  shit anymore but they didn't say about the law or anything about you're brother. So try asking you're brother to ask you're parents why they think it's ""unacceptable"" for you to be Trans. Also try talking to them first, about how you feel about differences about  you're body and you're personality that arent ""compatible"". If they refuse to let you go trans after that than call the police to file for Domestic abuse. Pls Hang in there, Bro 

YOU GOT THIS!
[removed]
I'm gonna hijack the top comment cuz I need help. I'm the father of a 16 year old girl wanting to transition to male and for now I said let wait till 18 so she can decide as an adult. Now I feel like I'm not being a good dad. I don't know what to do
Is it different than america? It’s really bad when they take you here, sent to a group home where you’ll be viciously abused by the other kids, and maybe the staff if you’re unfortunate. High chance the group home is catholic too.. 

I hope it’s better over there. Here people like op just run away and try to make it on their own. Not that there’s no help per say, but it depends where you are, and it’s unlikely housing will be an option.
I dont know if this is a good idea. Police rarely help situations. What can they do in this situation? They can't force them to treat their son like his brother.

I know this is abuse. I agree. But does the law in their area consider it abusive? Idk. I doubt the police will care and there is no guarantee he will find a social worker that will care, although I believe that's far more likely than a cop. Most cops will treat the OP like he's the crazy one.

Op should consider their situation carefully. Calling the authorities is not guarantee they will take his side and it could make the situation even worse in some ways. I'm not saying they shouldn't seek help, I'm saying I don't know that involving the police or social services is necessarily help.

He has 2 years or less and OP can GTFO. It's an eternity at 16, i know, but two years will come and go and they can get to a better place.

Op if I were you I would look to see if there are any trans support groups in your area. They will have a better idea of how the police and social services in your area will react to you. They might have better advice based on how the community treats trans folks in general. Be very careful here. Once social services and police are involved, anything can happen, including being taken from your home, however unlikely, and ending up in a worse situation.

I really believe you should look for a local trans group or LGBT+ group and get their opinion. Being in a community of others that understand can make a world of difference.

You deserve happiness, love and acceptance. Hang in there and you will find it.
i have spoken to a teacher and they told the safeguarding team who have spoken to my parents and are figuring something out. i haven't had a chance to show them the contract yet so will do when they next speak to me
haha as soon as i get a chance!
This^ I had abusive parents and moved out when I was 15. All I had to do was threaten to file for emancipation and they allowed me to leave. Best choice I ever made!

Best of luck to you <3

Edit: If you happen to be in Idaho, I have resources that can help you!
Also, even if _not_ signed by a minor, contracts signed under duress are not binding either (OP says they were _made_ to sign it).
okay thank you good to know
No illegal contract is legally binding.
far more important than that, like insanely more important than that, its not like you can just write down an agreement and call it a legally binding contract. In the U.S. it can lay the groundwork for a civil suit if someone agrees to do something for an amount, then that thing isn't paid, but in this case, it is an unnotarized piece of paper, with essentially meaningless parameters. It sounds like less of a contract and more of a scare tactic
agreed
thanks :)
i tried taking a picture and they tore it up and then reprinted it. i wasnt allowed a copy but i fished out the pieces they tore up from the trash and spent a few hours taping them up so yes i do have a copy
omg they make me see this therapist who is so blatantly transphobic
It's not legal.  
British citizens can be legally charged for hate crimes under these circumstances as one of my friend's parents got into hot water over it.
oh god that’s terrible man i hope you’re okay now. im half polish and go to poland a lot so i do know how difficult it can be in some places, im really lucky to live in the uk.
Also what does ""Sleep in your Bedroom"" mean?
Where are you sleeping now? Under the stairs like Harry Potter or what? wtf
Tell social services about such abuse.
And if they were forced upon you by threat of  punishment
The fbi? Lmao they have bigger issues.
pc
i genuinely didnt feel like i had a choice, i didnt even have time to think about it because i asked if i could have a few days and they were all ""tHe dEaL is OfF"". not sure if this counts but my dad who is a lawyer wrote the contract :D
Its very likely not a legally binding contract... its just some silly written up contract their parents wrote up and had their kid sign. Like a chore contract kids might sign with their parents, you don't need a lawyer for that lmao... It was also signed under duress meaning it would be void anyway. But seeing as how both not signing it AND breaking it means all the bad things happen anyway there is no way this is a ""legal"" contract much less one that needs lawyers present. Silly comment

lmao thanks for the advice, in the uk i can move out when i turn 16 so just waiting for that lol not too long now
Yea.. call child protective services?

Also, pro tip: leave home in girls clothes, change in the bathroom, do reverse when going home?

I mean.. their so awful.. would it bother you to seek rehoming possibly via adoption through social services into an accepting family?
It doesn’t justify all of those stupid thing just because he’s transgender, which by the way is natural cause we are born this way. So completely full of non sense to give the parents some credits there, you can as some point lost i admit but you can also look forward and think that it’s better to have a child who’s happy to be than death and buried.

Real case I used to know sadly is that my girlfriend who was also transgender, we were trying to work this out and the mom was completely acting like a douche not because of any mistake or what, just to make her and us mad … a parent like that should never have the right to educate his child, and I’m not wrong ont his those are hypocrites. They are the one capable to came to their child funeral and fake crying and leave in a minute but not caring at all for their child happiness.
>except i will probably be sent to this school if i disobey it which sounds like absolute hell

Brother you're going through absolute hell right now. They're just gonna keep upping their demands until they've ""fixed"" you. You've gotta act, NOW. This shit's illegal, nip it in the bud ASAP
Just an FYI to be a bit more clear, you cannot be legally bound by a contract if you're a minor. That ""contract"" has no more significance than any other pieces of paper.

Edit: also take Aphrodite's advice. Keep the contract, or a copy of it.
You could try to get kicked out of the school, but that might not end well.
Why not give the religious school hell back? When they deadname you, say your name. ALWAYS violate the dress code. Go in the mens restroom. Your parents are really trying to take from you your most prized posession, your identity. Don't give it to them.
hey man, while there might very well be transphobes at an all-girls school, at least some of your peers will be cool with you. Plus, you don't have to live with your parents if you're at a boarding school.

My boarding experience was LITERALLY the best experience I could have had in my life, simply because it got me away from abusive parents. Trust me when I say you'll be happier out of the rule of your parents, even in an all-female school. There, you can at least express yourself how you want to.

My thoughts are with you, kid. I'm sorry you're going through shit like this.
Your parents would be pretty stupid to do that. The ""contract"" is not legal and is actually evidence that your parents abused you. It's probably a scare tactic to make you think you are obligated to obey them.
As someone with parents very similar to yours: that contract doesn’t mean shit. They are forcing you to sacrifice your mental health for things you should have in the first place and it won’t stop there.
[removed]
You should talk to a councillor at school. This is abuse. Your parents are abusing you knowingly. This is ground for you to be liberated from them.
CPS is your best friend.
You can tell the school your parents threatened you, and it was signed under duress, which means it's not legally binding.
they’d do that with or without the contract. their power over you comes from them abusing their roles as parents. you’re being given the illusion of choice, nothing more.

I can’t give you any advice about what actions you can take, but, if you can manage it, hold fast to the knowledge that a decision forced upon you is not your decision at all. you never chose to detransition. you never chose to go by your deadname. you never chose to wear that uniform.

you might have to do all those things, and my heart breaks for you, but maybe it can help to realize that you won’t be betraying yourself. you’re just doing what you need to do to survive until you can finally break free.
Girls catholic school isn’t the worst place in the world for a trans guy. A shocking number of people there will be lgbt… no guys to date? They just date each other.

If it’s a boarding school you get to go away from your parents, too.
A contract signed by coercion is automatically invalid!
FYI you can flag awards and if enough people do this it will get rid of it, still angry some fucker actually finds that comment funny
While I agree wholeheartedly, it’s best not to give them that attention. Just let them waste their cash on reddit coins
might have been a free award, not sure how they work. still, not appropriate.
Child abuse js ""physical, sexual, and/or psychological maltreatment or neglect of a child or children, especially by a parent or a caregiver."" 

Explain to me, in detail, how it is not psychological abuse to force your child to conform to your ideal version of what they should be, isolate them from their friends and peers, and emotionally neglect them by withholding love and support.

Remember: conversion therapy is literally considered abuse.
If possible, you may be able to move in with a friend. It’s not betrayal, the adults in your life have already failed to be parents. Getting away from them is top priority. Much love
[removed]
i will do when the safeguarding team next speaks to me!
[removed]
He is a minor that was coerced into signing away their rights, to his parents, under threat of continuance and furtherance of abuse. This 'contract' is in no ways legal, or holds any legal weight, any judge that gives a shit about the law would take this as evidence against the parents not the child, as this 'contract' is itself abuse.
The contract's irrelevant.

>(looking at it now, i dont actually get anything in return, i just get to keep the things i should have anyway)

Contracts require consideration, i.e. some benefit for both parties. Since OP's parents are *already* obligated to perform their end of the bargain, the contract is void.
no. that contract is not legally binding whatsoever. you cant sign over your rights, it is with a minor and they were under duress. this is not great advice op. your best bet is child services and there are many trans helplines you can talk to about this stuff
many contracts between adults or companies have illegal clauses that a judge wouldn't enforce. doesn't matter if both parties signed and understood. a minor first often cannot sign a contract at all, second cannot sign away their rights to their parents.
[removed]
It’s not a light thing for most trans people to come out to their parents, there’s a good chance he’s been thinking about it for a while, you should talk to him about it and just try to learn more
the most common misconception is that it is a decision. it is not. if i hadn’t come out, i would have committed. let your child be themselves please, that doesn’t have to involved letting them medically transition, just let them express themselves
Congrats you’re the shitty parent of a 16 year old boy. Go do the bare minimum for him
Let him transition socially, see if he likes it, nothing permanent, no need for hormones, just identity (call him male pronouns, chosen male name, address him as your son) and dress. Let him see a mental health professional for a diagnosis.
Maybe settle for puberty blockers till 18? I dunno, I'm not trans, and I'm not a parent, I'd like to think I wouldn't care and believe them, but I'm antinatalist and in no position to adopt so I'll never have a kid
You are being abusive and exerting coercive control
Considerably different
""the team has talked to my parrents"" but not you? you as the victim should be the 1st person they talk to
good luck, man.
I'm glad you showed them, I'm so very sorry you are going through this. Hold fast to who you are, we know you are valid, your parents are so mistaken and are being abusive. I am the mom of a trans kid and wish I could talk to your parents.
Best wishes! What they're doing is really messed up, I hope things get better soon.

<3333333
Stay strong brother.
Good luck man
literally call up child protective services and tell them you are being abused, you need to be proactive with this or you will be forced to live like this until you are financially independent
Honestly if I were you, move out ASAP and f*ck them off out of your life and never speak to them again.
there's a little less legal precedence there, especially in the uk, because a trans person being told by their parents they'll be enrolled in a different school (something they could do for any reason) if they don't detransition isn't necessary duress, just a parental consequence. to be clear, i 100% disagree with that line of reasoning, but if i were a british judge i would probably follow it
This would be the nonprofit near you, as someone from the UK, I guess.

https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/contact-us/
btw and even if it where binding. A contract has to have an expire date, or a regulation with what time delays it can be canceled.
If nothing is determined and there is no law in place for a certain type of contract there is no time delay to a cancellation. For your ""Contract"" there is certainly no law in place. 

Would be gold if you just write them a cancelation haha.

Dear Mr. and Ms. legal parent, 

with this letter i cancel our contract from DATE, to the DATE. 

Go fuck yourself you FUCKERS

Sincerly your Son


Actually having their abuse signed by them self could really help you. They testify by their sign that they are abusing you.
As a student in the UK, the easiest way to do this is simply talk to your favourite teacher and explain the situation in detail. They have a duty of care and are required to pass it to a safeguarding lead, another teacher at the school, who will assess it and in turn reach out to other services.
Considering that this contract is in no way enforceable and could be used against them as evidence of child abuse, their destruction of the document you signed nullifys the issue of enforcement and so now it's an issue of destruction of evidence. 

And you say your dad is a lawyer? Not a very good one, it sounds like. You should study the law because I think you will have to defeat him to be free. And you could. He is weak and vain, and you're smarter.

Good luck dude. That's going to be rough but you can survive this! Honestly even Catholic school is less abusive than your dad, and Catholic school sucked.
Good thought! Show it to safeguarding. Best of luck man, we're all rooting for you here.
That is conversion therapy. There's a hotline for victims of conversion therapy in the uk, they might be able to help.

https://galop.org.uk/get-help/helplines/
yikes i’m sorry
Good to know. I’m American, so I don’t know the law in the UK.
I really hope you'll be able to start your transition very soon, my friend 😊 I managed to start mine at the age of 20 and I'm absolutely happy with the changes
Also they don't operate outside of the US...
Offf in so sorry doll that’s terrible. No that actually is worse.
Don't worry, signing it doesn't change anything. It doesn't even matter that this ""contract"" was written by a lawer. Forcing your child to sign a ""contract"" that says that to be treated with decency you have to live a certain way is simply not legal.
[removed]
[removed]
This isn’t the place to do that.
also, consider bringing this situation up with any councillors you see in school (or any teacher you trust). getting across the severity of the situation and the consequences you face/the abuse you have suffered, this should stress the importance of confidentiality in this situation between the school and your parents(so as to avoid making things worse by the school telling your parents youre being vocal about this). schools also have communication with local police forces, meaning they are able to effectively notify the police of a safeguarding concern as severe as this.
thanks you’re a wonderful person i’ll work something out
However it is useful as evidence of child abuse. The OP should acquire a copy of that contract and put it away in a safe place.
also contracts signed under threat/duress are null and void
Also being coarser into a signing a contract invalidates it even is op wasn’t a minor
I was thinking he might get kicked out of an all girls catholic school just for being an openly trans guy, honestly. Or maybe transferred to an all boys Catholic school? Like the character Elle on Heartstopper
This.
Best suggestion ever. If OP winds up getting transferred to an all-boys school for doing all that (which may not necessarily happen), then more power to him.
I understand and agree with the point of this comment but I don’t think an all girls catholic school will have a mens restroom
Would this be legally considered abuse?
I would keep a copy of that to give to child protective services as well.
I just saw in the UK, contracts signed by a minor are binding in the case of apprenticeship, employment, education, and services where the minor is the beneficiary, this is not the case at all. So don't worry, you can lie to them without legal damage. Still you should call for help, CPS and such, because you're not safe in your own household
No one cares what you think as you’re objectively incorrect. Your opinion and views are insignificant
Thanks, I flagged them. Didn’t know you could flag awards.
Looks to be one of the freebies.
I don't think ""laughing"" award style is a free one; usually the free ones are just ""Silver"", ""Wholesome"" and ""Helpful"". The awarder might have used free coins on it but most likely it was paid by actual money.
Report the account please. It's all troll.
[removed]
This is not funny, wtf is your problem?
Don’t wait, this is not legal, you need support now. I hope you can get away and be yourself 🤞🏻💚
If you can, take a picture of the ""contract"". It could be important evidence.
Please get help as soon as you can, you don’t deserve that sort of treatment.

Here are some phone numbers that may help you.

Emergency police - 999

Non emergency police - 101

Child line - 0800 1111
Please keep us updated, I wish the very best to you <3
please do this now, bcuz this is outrageous, to an extend where im reloading my imaginary shotgun with a ""religious"" intent.

please try to survive thrue this, as at some point you will come out at the top.

stay safe, youre valid <33
Do not wait. Call someone, call for help.

You are being abused. Whatever the UK equivalent for 911 is(I forgot what it was called), you need to do something.

You're in danger.
Hey, social working in training here, I just finished legislation unit and we not only learnt about laws here in Aus but elsewhere. Don't wait, get help as soon as we can, the longer and more comprehensive your paper trail is, the more likely you are to get somewhere. It's shouldn't be on you to advocate for yourself but you need to make it clear you're being abused which you are and that your parents are harming you. 

Be clear, be concise, e.g. ""My parents, their treatment of me and their disregard of my true identity is causing me both mental and emotional distress. It is making me consider self-harm, if the situation does not change I will be at risk of a mental health crisis."" 

I really hope things pan out for you, please give us updates if you feel you can.
Why are you working your shit out on others? Because YOU lived through hardships? Pathetic.
This ^^^^

Can't speak for if this is illegal or not, but the contract is in no way enforceable or legally binding given the topics it supposedly covers. Even an adult cannot sign a contract that allows an abuser to break the law, because its not up to you what laws apply and where, without it being considered void.

Essentially, all OP has done is sign a bit of their parents fanfiction. It means as much as it did when it was a blank piece of paper.

Tbh the bigger issue here is OP being a minor and therefore still in care of parents, so it's more on if they want to try and endure the care system or not.

Source - worked for a contract law firm (not as a lawyer to be clear) and this kind of issue frequently crops up. Abusers like to think a contract can protect them from anything, but its actually not that easy to write a legally binding contract, and they frequently void their own documents.
I mean it was void the second they had a minor sign it anyways
[removed]
I can confirm it's been a couple. She told me during COVID crises back in 2020. I raised my 3 girls alone. My middle daughter is autistic and I'm in constant fear of her being bullied. My first reaction was fear that now my oldest was going to make herself a target. I'm passed that now, but I just don't know if I'm being a jerk by saying wait till 18? To complicate matters I named her after my favorite grandma so that makes me sad too. Help
Thanks so much that's suppppppeeerrr helpful
This is excellent advise. I guess me reaching out here was the last step for me to accept
I literally just heard about them. I think it's too late cuz she has a very obvious female shape she hides. She spoken of getting her breasts removed too. My mother had breast cancer and had that done I'll never forget those chest scars
Good to here.

We have some really awful social systems here. Mostly designed to punish the poor. 

One of my best friends growing up was a bit of a misfit, his mom couldn’t control him, and she was blacked out on pills all the time. She kept calling the police when he didn’t listen to her delirious ass. After enough calls, they took him, sent him to the group home, where he was held down and beaten for being white every single day until he could escape. The other kids wouldn’t let him eat, kept taking his food, said things like “you’re white, you’ll be alright” they’d throw Mayo at him…. The group home was forcing him into religion, beating him with a paddle for telling on the other kids who abused him…. and this is one of the “good” states systems. One of the best even, it only gets worse. 

We have support groups for runaway trans kids and stuff, but they aren’t all over the place, and they don’t necessarily provide housing. It’s unlikely even and any support you can find is probably backed up and underfunded. 

It’s a fucking disgrace that “the wealthiest country in the world” can’t take care of it’s people who need help the most.
Yeah that's a huge red flag, I'd consider them I lability and find a third party to help.
Never speak to them again… until it’s possible to put them in the worst retirement home available
sure but it wasn't witnessed by a third party and they're a minor so regardless of the content of the contract it wouldn't be legally binding. it's not necessarily illegal that they made the op sign it it's just not legally enforceable in anyway.
I think the part where he was made to sign a contract where he wasn't allowed to sleep in his own bed means it might count as under duress - do they mean literally kicking him out, or taking away his literal bed? Forcing him to sleep in a basement/other room, bedless? All of these point to making him sign to agree to avoid to conditions which could be seen as abusive, and that might help form his case.
I'm not sure how it is in the UK, but the way I was taught in a US legal studies class (so only a very cursory amount of knowledge) is that both parties have to actually gain something from a contract in order for it to be legitimate. The example we were always given was that if you signed a contract where you agreed to work for free for years, it would never be enforceable.

OP signed a contract where they ""get"" things not taken away from him. OP makes a bunch of concessions and in return gets things to remain the ""same.""
so happy for you!
Didn’t even see that op was in the uk maybe they should call mi6 🤣
yeah :/
Parents that aren’t ready to love and support their kid however they turn out shouldn’t have children.

This right here is a perfect example of shitty parents being fucking shitty.

Keep up with the times or get the fuck out of the way.
They are forcefully suppressing their child’s identity, which is going to cause a lot of emotional and mental trauma.  I know because I’ve lived it.

I don’t care how fucking hard it is to “accept”, you either do right by your child and love them how they are or you’re a shitty parent that should have never reproduced.
Except it is?? Tf you on about
Contact child protective services in your area.
Reach out to charity organisations, government social workers are completely useless (not always their fault though).

Here is a good start, Mermaids/AllSorts and many others will point you in right direction and help you:
https://www.google.com/search?q=uk%20trans%20kids%20charity%20&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
Contact a lawyer of you can. Not only is that contact not legally binding due to coersion, half the stuff in there would/should make for a stupid easy court case.

(I am not a lawyer)

Child abuse is fucked and i get legitamately almost violently angry when i see or think about it for personal reasons.

This is absolutely on your parents, and has nothing to do with you. You probably are aware of all this, but they are terrible people. They are abusive as fuck and if you can prove it, great. They deserve what ever shit happens to them. I wish I could help somehow, this shit makes me so angry.

As satisfying as it might be to try and antagonize them, or carry out ""malicious compliance"" it might be satisfying short term, but it will be worse long term. At the very least, you mentioned living in the uk, so you shouldn't have to deal with the stupiddest parts of american stuff. Presumably you have some form of access to health care and such which is huge.

Right now, the best thing you can do is to get out. The sooner the better, but not at the cost of tying yourself to someone else, (**anyone** else, as you'll simply be trading one tyrant for another, even if that person means well) or putting yourself in a significantly worse situation. This is not going to get better, and the people who are **not** your parents, but **are** the people who technically gave birth to you, are not going to stop escallating things. If you happen to fuck up thier lives on your wat out of thiers, good. They more than deserve it. It's not unlikely that you may feel guilt for something like that, but you shouldn't. They are terrible people who are ruining thier own lives. Whatever happens is on thier heads for being such biggoted people. If your brother (assuming he's old enough to understand) doesn't see an issue with things that's a problem in and of itself. I knew the way someone else was being treated, wasn't right, but didn't say anything because i knew my head was next on the metephorical chopping block. It still didn't make the situation ok, and if i could have i would have liked to point out the stupidity and hypocrisy of the situation, but i wasn't brave enough to risk suffering the consequences.

If you feel any regret or compassion for the people actively hurting you, my parents were/are dumb as fuck, despite one being ""rather smart"", but only in certain areas and stupid as hell everywhere else. Some part of me still hates them. Your ""parents"" are actively maliciously hatefully making things worse. And whatever excuses they have aren't enough to justify thier behaviour.

I believe you said you were rather young. There are other people who are like you, and have made it out and are doing ok all things considered. Worst case scenario, you can do whatever you have to do, to survive, and once you get out from under thier thumb, you can starting working to undo all the damage they caused. It's going to suck, and it will be unpleasant. But you can do it. It's not fair, or right. But that's the way things are. It shouldn't be, but it is. People are just awful sometimes, but people can also be really good. I'm sure there is a great community, waiting for you, ready to welcome and accept and support you. You just have to get there.

No matter what happens, they can't take what you are away from you. You can call yourself whatever is necessary to thier face. That does not prevent you from calling yourself, thinking of yourself as whatever you want in your mind. If you have a teacher at school, that you really really trust, consider asking them for help or support or advice. If you have someone who has been supportive of you they might be able to help somehow.

I don't know what it's like to be a member of the lgbt community or to be in the situation you are in because of that, but i do know what it's like to have parents that make your life more unpleasant. I know that it sucks, and they don't deserve to have what they do. They don't deserve to have as wonderful of a person/child as you. Someone like you, is completely wasted in thier hands. And their never going to realize any of it, unless they do when it's far too late.

For all the shit my parents did, as ""great"" of an attempt as they made to teach me anything at all, at the very least, i have an appartment, where i get to make the rules, and i only really have to see my parents if i want to. I had to work my ass off at a factory job, but i suppose things are alright all things considered. Stuff is good enough, and i suppose i'm happy enough, and it's certainly better than it was. I sucked getting to where i am now, and i went to college for a degree i'm not really using (yay). Point is, my parents fucked up a lot of stuff, and i fucked up some stuff, and i and my situation are still mostly ok.

You can make it. You can make things the way you want them to be. I sure things probably suck right now, but that doesn't mean thier going to suck forever.

I hope things turn out as good as they can for you. That doesn't mean things are going to be perfect, but I hope for the best outcome you can have. I hope your parents realize the mistake they made, right after you're free, and it's too late to do anything about it, and they spend the rest of thier lives honestly trying to make up for what they did. And if they don't, fuck 'em. They aren't worth it anyways.

History is full of people who were what they wanted to be, and they rest of the world was too stuborn to admit it, and that didn't stop those people from making the life they wanted to have. If it takes you however long to set things right, either by getting away, or exposing them for what they are, you'll still have plenty of time after, to make the life you want to have. In the grand scheme of things, this all is just a big ugly awful speed/road bump. Once you're past it, you can make things better for yourself. All you've got to do now, is get past it. By whatever means you can.

(I do appologize for this being so long)
Call the cops on your parents for mental abuse
I'm being realistic. Why haven't you done anything, and why does it take a random stranger on the internet to tell you.
Yes. OP needs to do this.
don’t worry, i have a few copies in different places
And give copies to their therapist/counselor/other trusted adults. Spread the copies around so yote parents can't easily destroy the evidence
Yes
Absolutely. They can't take away your phone, not let you sleep in your bedroom, mistreat you, nor force you to detransition. Everything they're doing to you IS illegal and you have to contact someone, like the police, and they WILL help you.
I’m in the U.S and completely unfamiliar with UK law but I’ve been a foster mom and mandated reporter and where I live it would absolutely be considered abuse. I would call your local gender center from a friend or trusted teacher’s phone. See if they can help you find legal representation and guide you on how to fight this.
[removed]
I'm in the UK and my barrister friend says abuse and assault both in play. The contract is proof of their intent so get it or a copy before you bug out.

Social workers can't be relied upon as the framework they work in is very weak so it comes down to the individual case worker and their interpretation. Her suggestion is to get in touch with a trans charity any will help even if it's just passing you to a more suitable group. 

Very Important: This isn't you doing anything wrong, bad, or evil. It is about your parents putting conditions on their love and acceptance of you which is wrong. If you don't act now, and I know it's terrifying, it will get worse until you finally break. That tends to be when you kill yourself.

Have you any friends or relatives who could help you today while you sort out things long term?  Hell if you're within reach of Nottingham I've got a comfy couch and a cat you can fuss, she's a bit of an attention whore TBH.
So My veiw that abusing trans people is insignificant? And i am objectively incorrect?
As far as I’m aware the only free ones are wholesome, silver, helpful, and bear hug
Sure, but I'm also going to leave a comment for the lurkers who might agree
>Youre just some alt right clown trying to make trans people look dumb, no one is buying it

Bruh are you even trying? 😂
Duded created this account to troll. Every comment. Report the account.
i'd like to say you're right, and that it isn't legal, but in the uk, it still is, and the current prime minister shows no signs of changing that, despite pressure from both the opposition and his own party.

Well here’s a chance to give your new son a new name that means just as much to you! But it kind of depends on what you mean when you say “waiting until 18” does that mean waiting until 18 to medically transition, or does that include harmless stuff like allowing him to change his presentation and name and such
Who you named your child after is irrelevant (& kind insulating to your kid), your kid is not them, your kid is not a copy of them. Your kid deserves to be their own person with their own identity.
What country are you in? I’ll find some resources for parents to help you understand better. 
When your child experiences gender dysphoria it can be debilitating to the point they are sometimes suicidal so this is quite serious. Having you support him to become himself would be the most incredible thing a parent could do. It could prevent years if suffering. 
Let me know and I’ll send you legitimate resources that can help you.
Gonna be honest I don’t really care. You didn’t do the smallest amount of research into this when your son came out. You just decided that clearly he would regret it so fuck his happiness.
I had a similar thing but I managed to get out of it. Plus as soon As I turn 18 it’s off to Deutschland for university and hopefully the rest of life the laws they got there protecting people like us are truly amazing
Is any of your extended family supportive
[removed]
I mean they are straight up threatening their child
👆👆👆
[removed]
thank you you sweet sweet human. i am working something out, i’m sure it will be fine
This is rude and we all should be supportive, especially since OP is a minor
There are reasons someone will take some time to react, and need some help or/and support! Do not criticise you are not in their position!
its only going to get worse dude, time to get out now, dont let them waste more of your life.
You might consider a friend holding a copy too or that sort of thing. 

Your parents are evil. This is unbelievably messed up. 

I don’t know what to do legally, even less so given you’re in the UK, but if at worst you have to play along with them until you’re older, you are still valid. You are still who you are, and none of these things change that, even if you have to play along with them for your safety. 

I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. Please do not hurt yourself or take this out on yourself. You are valid and you’re doing nothing wrong.
But the OP did mention that he lives in the UK, trans protection is absolute dogshit there.
[removed]
yeah did my whole gcse speaking endorsement on trans conversion therapy its genuinely disgusting that its still legal
 domestic abuse is not legal
[deleted]
Mental conversion therapy for under 18 is now illegal in the UK
Ye not with that contract, there isn’t any situation in witch that can be put under conversion therapy.
It's not legal to force a minor to sign a contract under the threat of unfair treatment and losing basic things. It's also domestic abuse, which certainly isn't legal.
I’m also in the uk, and child abuse is child abuse regardless of context so is therefore illegal, but yeah Bojos stance on CT (which they admit in the consultation documents does not work and is harmful!) is the reason why I’m still not out, I live in a blue county and it’s killing me having to hide who I am still.
Good, you could additionally send them to a person you trust. That way your parents will never get rid of the evidence.
It’s up to OP to decide how much danger they are in, that’s why I provided multiple numbers.

I've always told him (first time using that pronoun) he can present as anything he likes. And I have  his back no matter what permanent changes she wants as an adult. I guess I just fear her changing her mind later in life and asking me why I let him do it.
no that’s the most annoying but both sides of my family are immensely conservative so there isn’t a single person that i’m aware of who supports me
Look at you, literally advocating for suppressing LGBTQ+ identities because… why exactly?
THIS
They wouldn’t. In the uk getting sent to the mental health ward aka being sectioned is an extremely last option thing. Op has no reason to need to be sectioned. Despite what you seem to think, the UK is for the majority accepting. It is required you are for heath care  jobs. To be sectioned, your case must be reviewed by a doctor, the person wanting to admit you, a psychiatrist and if the police are involved, the police. Most likely Op, you will not end up getting sectioned, im here for you :)
No they wouldn't. Even in the US. 

I'm a mandatory reporter. CYS/CPS investigates and if they have concerning findings they contact the police. They also try to find family that can take the kid in or have emergency foster placement.

It is a shit situation. Don't make it worse by spreading false info.
Sometimes being rude gets people moving. To achieve, you need to go outside your comfort zone. Just being supportive isn't good enough, you need to tell some people to get them going.

People will disagree with this opinion, and I understand that. However, at the end of the day, I am thinking with OP in mind and do worry for their wellbeing.
Forcing your kid to conform to your wishful thinking of what they should be is abusive no matter the subject at hands
it's one of the things which is protected enough for it to be illegal

also some of those things are just not legal in general, without even being trans
Actually children in most countries do have property rights.


If you give your child a console or phone, it's theirs.
This is bullshit. The country doesn't give you mental support even if you need it...

They aren't frotning 3 years of mental hospital stay for someone that isn't mentally unwell.
but conversion therapy isn't. and since all of these demands have almost exclusively to do with being trans, it seems like it could easily be spun as legal through the legality of conversion therapy.
domestic abuse is illegal, but conversion therapy isn't (and trans people aren't nearly as ""protected"" as the phrase would imply). considering this, i think that it could easily be spun to be legal, since almost all of the demands made could fall within the bounds of conversion therapy, which is not legally considered abuse and thus is legal, and will likely continue to be legal against trans people.
[removed]
i hate doing this but... source? because as of my knowledge, the UK government hasn't yet made any legislative motion to ban conversion therapy other than simply stating that it will do so, and even so, they're only planning on banning conversion therapy based on sexuality, not gender identity, despite the fact that the opposition, and even quite a few tory MPs, are constantly saying they should ban it completely
That depends. It certainly seems like it shouldn't be, but that certainly doesn't mean it necessarily counts as child abuse in the eyes of the law. In the end, it all comes down to precedent. Or just who has the best lawyer.
yeah, it does suck. then again, blue counties aren't all as horrible as they seem, at least from my experience living out in great yarmouth (tory safe seat, currently held by brandon lewis), but then again, i'm also a shut-in who never leaves her room, and i do often get misgendered (not in an aggressive way but still) by people who only know me as emilia, showing at best a low level of understanding, and at worst a lack of respect, so i can't really say it's the best.
Agree. This is the way. You do not deserve this, and your parents are behaving in a horrific manner. You have to look out for yourself. Stay strong.

Detransition is extremely rare, I’ve heard numbers like less than 1% of the community detransitions voluntarily. And in those situations it normally seems like they’re transitioning for the wrong reasons. In your son’s case, if it’s something he’s expressed interest in for 2 years at this point, it could be a good chance to let him experiment with presentation and identity. Nothing permanent has to be done until you’re both comfortable with it
What about friends and their families, that’s what I ended up doing for a while then my mother finally kinda came to terms
Yeah I see your point but tough love never worked on me. We gotta build their confidence up! Or else they might not even ask for help in the future

Edit: changed 'Have' to 'yeah' and 'in' to 'on.' Lol new phone
that is true, but we are talking legality here. no matter what we think, the state has the final say, especially in these urgent situations.
this is domestic abuse

and you  are  facilitating  it   with you   transphobic  assertions
One of the few things I hate about the UK
[deleted]
I did some searching and what you wrote is all I found. No law on the books yet. Along with what you wrote, they also aren't banning it for anyone over 18 who consents or is coerced into having it.
I think I got confused with [this](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/banning-conversion-therapy)

I have 4 girls funny enough. Never had a son
that is an option but most friends parents are supportive of me but too scared of my parents to do anything to actually support me.. last time a parent used my correct name they received a series of very unfriendly messages from my parents
You are correct. Confidence is an important building block to sustaining the resistance against those who hate you for existing.
Correct me if I'm wrong but to my knowledge is child abuse not legal in the UK. Sure the state has a final say but I'd say op has a pretty solid case
do you think i like this? do you think i enjoy living in this fucking hellhole of country just because i point out how fucked it is? 

Whether you, i, or anyone else likes it, the law doesn't define abuse based on what you feel is abusive, and domestic abuse is very easy to spin as just ""an alternative form of parenting"" especially since conversion therapy's legality means that the law won't necessarily recognise any of this behaviour as abusive, no matter how abhorrent we know it is.
They never said that it WASN'T transphobia. They explained the UK context wherein conversion therapy for trans is allowed authorities may not see it as abuse but an attempt at conversion therapy thereby siding with the parents.

Me explaining that does not excuse it, defend it, or in any way shape or form justify conversion therapy. It is absolutely barbaric. But this is something the OP may need to consider in crafting a plea for help to accentuate the abusive elements vis-à-vis the demands for detransitioning (which is to an extent legal over there with additional complications when involving a minor). 

So you got two forces at play: the abuse of the parents, and the legality of conversion therapy in the UK with the added shittiness of legal guardianship of a minor.
You shouldn't judge someone trying to see the context to understand the problem, this person isn't being transphobic. Stop being inclusive, that's the total opposite idea of what we are talking about here. The goal is to help someone in need, not sending this someone to a worst scenario, jeez...
Yes but in the UK the police allow domestic abuse as long as the abuser calls it conversion therapy.

That's the point.
She's not being transphobic tho??????
[removed]
It’s probably not illegal but it may be illegal to force a person to de transition
Fair enough. It's a foolish, but common, mistake to think the government will actually do what it says its going to do, and I wouldn't blame you for making it.
[removed]
[removed]
It sounds like you may have one now! I wish you luck though I know it’s a hard situation. I’d say just try to work with them and do what you’re comfortable with. As scary as the idea is that they’ll do something they regret, there’s also the opposite that they miss out on stuff by not doing it
Thanks for confirming  you endorse domestic violence.
No they do not .

Stop being a transphobic liar and child abuser.

One of the arguments  that is being used against  a conversion  therapy ban is that coercive  control like this is all ready illegal
Absolutely  is  claiming that it's legal because  conversion  therapy isn't a criminal offence. 

This is domestic abuse and coercive control which Absolutely  are criminal matters.
Said with all the confidence of a new account.

I heard anyone who ever loved you was wrong. That was the smartest person who told me that. A great person.  The best. Simply tremendous.
There's no written law in place to say that's the case, so that would come down to precedent, or, if there is no precedent, it would come down to who has the best lawyer.
They're all rich, cis/het white men, they are not ever going to fully understand how we feel.
[removed]
Go spread your hate somewhere else, you are on the attacker side here
Im not saying that's 100% the case, however I'm explaining that the law is not often so cute and dry, and cases like these can be incredibly slippery, especially if you know how to twist the truth and the law in your favour. I'm not saying that it's OK because it's legal, or vice versa. I'm saying that the world is cruel, and the law doesn't always work the way we think it should, so just calling the police and hoping for the best is not always a viable option.
Try reading it again; she's saying that it could be *spun as* conversion therapy to get out of legal repercussions, not that it's in any way morally acceptable.
I’d argue that it is neglecting a child’s access to health care. 
In Australia we work under UK common law and sometimes when they are about to implement a law they stop prosecuting under the current rules even though it’s not fully in writing yet. 
Sadly I’ve read the conversation laws in the uk don’t cover trans people which is disgusting.
I wouldn't necessarily say that about the whole of parliament, in fact most of parliament wants to ban conversion therapy entirely, but the prime minister really doesn't, and most of the tory party are too busy sucking him off (sometimes literally) to give a shit.
[removed]
Really  ? 

I'm not the person telling the OP that  the abuse they are receiving from their parents is acceptable , and that  it's conversion therapy but it's ok because it isn't banned.

Give your head a wobble transphobe...
oh, you do not want to get into the uk's terrible trans healthcare. anyway, this is specifically relating to social transition, as it doesn't seem like OP has started medical transition yet, as may be a different story (though i wouldn't count on it)
I agree, but there's still a critical lack of representation in parliament.
The whole point is that we're saying it's not acceptable, but it is legal and that's what we're disgusted with.... Well and you but still
>I'm not the person telling the OP that the abuse they are receiving from their parents is acceptable

They didn't say this.

>and that it's conversion therapy but it's ok because it isn't banned.

They didn't say this.

In fact they stated this VVVV a whole 9 hours before you posted the above -

>the law won't necessarily recognise any of this behaviour as abusive, *no matter how abhorrent we know it is*.

So its clear they dont think the whole thing is ok, and you are clearly *choosing* to have a bad faith interpretation.

Stating that something isn't a crime ≠ endorsing that action

Waking granny up with an airhorn is probably legal, but we can all agree its a shitty thing to do.

Conversion therapy has been a hot issue in the UK recently, and it is being actively kept legal by the government despite popular opposition. That doesn't mean people think that's ok, but it does mean that *conversion therapy* specifically is not illegal. It isn't considered abusive, regardless of the fact that we all know it is.

Should it be illegal? Yes.

Is stating that it currently isn't, transphobic? No.

Not that any of that matters as the contract is in no way legal in the first place. You're punching in the wrong direction, and it isn't helping anyone here, you, OP and the rest of the community included.
Everyone already explained that isn't what they said and you're still freaking the fuck out. Calm down and think for half a second

And quit throwing around the word transphobe at non transphobic people. It ruins the word asshat
yep, i can definitely agree with that, though it's nothing compared to the uk supreme court (albeit that the way the supreme court are selected means that being old is kinda a given and becoming more diverse would first require the field of law to become more diverse, so it's understandable that diversity in the supreme court is a few decades behind)
They're supposed to represent the general public lmao.
I'm aware. But at least the government is transparent. In the UK, we kinda take for granted that we can just read about or watch almost all of the proceedings of parliament, sometimes live or even in person, and all for free at that. Our government sucks, but at least we have access to all of the info we need to know exactly how they suck

Me (left) and my gf (right). She accepted me for who I was with no hesitation, and has been steadfastly supportive ever since.		"Ñ'aww!! A beautiful couple! And a goth loving goth one as well! Love to see it!!!
The little gremlin in my brain saw this and started shouting ""goth gfs!! Goth gfs!!""
Fucking gorgeous
I love how you two have the same makeup! 🥰 so cute together! 💚
Growing up, I used to dream of the kind of love that women in rom-coms were given. Like, Princess Diaries? That shit was my guilty pleasure. And even though I was much closer to being the goofy dude who fell in love with his best friend, I always found myself so envious of Mia, for the affirming love that she was afforded by said goofy dude who fell in love with his best friend.

What I’m trying to say is, relationships like yours, where one partner wholeheartedly affirms the identity of the other is now my ultimate goal.
You two are adorable and wish you the best.
I love you're guys makeup ^^ I'm bad at eye makeup

I've been sitting here for around five minutes trying to figure out what to comment, because I felt like I had to comment something, as this post made me really happy. But instead of using my brain cell (ew, who does that?) I'm just going to give you this absolutely incredible advice: if you meet any meanie-beanie who tries to make you feel bad for being who you are, just throw a bunch of trans flags into the air and yell as loud as you can, ""BITCH I'M FABULOUS!"" And then disappear in a cloud of pink blue and white smoke.

Aww love the goth GFs! You look so fem that if you hadn't said who you were I wouldn't know who was trans! You're both cute!

Lol, touched a nerve here.		"you're comment is literally so simple and agreeable it always shocks me how stupid people can be to disagree with this stuff. like, just let the damn kids be themselves 😭😭😭
If the reason truly is because male puberty gives trans girls an advantage, they should ban any athlete with any advantage.

Also I hate using the ""athlete"" in this context because they are literally school children playing for fun and exercise. It's not the freaking Olympics and people don't place bets on high school football games.
""the government has too much power. We want less government (unless it's to regulate those transgendereded confused kids or women's bodies)"".  Idiots
""Puberty tips the scale, sport should be segregated by sex""

- Okay, well lets talk about that more in depth and strive to make sports an equal playing field for everyone! Kids are allowed to play together though right?

""...""

- Right..?
As an FTNB on testosterone therapy, my initial interpretation of that was ""male puberty"" being what my body is doing right now, so they were arguing that trans men have an inherent advantage over cis women, and therefore shouldn't be forced to play with them.

But, no, they're only obsessed with the trans women in sports.
Recent studies show there is no clear advantage, if at all, for trans (mtf) athletes.

People seem to want to pretend all cis bodies are the same so there is genetic parity. That’s absolute bs. And professional sport is mental as well as physical, something else completely ignored.

It’s also a patronising argument against cis women - the notion that anyone who at one time possessed a penis and some extra testosterone is better than they are by default is insulting af.

[https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/01/26/trans-women-no-unfair-advantage-elite-sport-new-report-finds/](https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/01/26/trans-women-no-unfair-advantage-elite-sport-new-report-finds/)
Anyone seen female wrestling? Bfs a big wwe fan. I’m 6’2”, about 200lbs and this trans woman would be scared to get in the ring with those women, they would snap me in half.

It’s not about gender or physical equality, it’s about trying to take away anything that could be part of a normal life from a trans person. I wholeheartedly agree that the government needs to stay out of my and everyone else’s metaphorical pants.

While it’s sad to see how downvoted your comment was, I also laugh a bit, I must be getting a thick skin to the hate. I’m laughing because I’m like damn, you call they come a runnin like chickens for supper. Cluck cluck, bawk! Lol.

Keep your heads up my siblings, love you all!
Unpopular opinion: people stress about the trans community in sports because they inherently believe, consciously or not, that (cis) men > (cis) women. The reality is: the only reason you see less pro women athletes is because of lack of funding, difficult access to facilities, social stigma, etc.
The funny thing is, there are exactly *zero* reputable scientific studies demonstrating trans women retain testosterone-associated athletic advantages after ~2 years of feminizing HRT.  There’s a reason why trans athletes have been allowed to compete at the Olympics for almost **TWENTY YEARS**.  (And also why in that same period, we’ve had exactly *one* trans Olympian— and she didn’t even make it past Prelims.)
I mean i think dividing by division would just be the answer over gender in general, lol.  There’s mixed gender sports all over, just do it based on division of physical ability regardless of gender.  Test the athletes and compete them against people in similar classes.
I’ve not heard of any studies, valid peer reviewed ones, that conclude “there is an inherent advantage “.  Please direct me to them if there are any.
*inhales,* they're CHILDREN. Children that want to play ball with their friends. Just let them play! Don't we have bigger issues to deal with right now? It's a game. It's not like it has any sociopolitical significance. People need to just leave these kids alone, I really agree with you.
""Small government"" fans when someone suggests small government
If you recognize 'em, how 'bout linkin' to 'em?
Sports are ALL ABOUT people with ""unfair advantages"" because of genetics, growth during puberty. nutrition, etc. being the winners.

""It's no FAIR! She only beat me in the race because she's a faster RUNNER than I am!!!!!!""
yall remembee the olympic swimmer? her times went down pretty drastically once she started estrogen and she lost plenty of races in women's competitions. transphobes will find any, and every reason to stop a trans person from succeeding or diss on any accomplishments they make. i lost a lot of ""friends"" when that came up.
I can guarantee that most of those downvotes are parents that scream at elementary school referees.
In reality there are not that many trans athletes around. Like 1 out of thousands. Banning trans people from competing make no sense considering they don't push much of an advantage to the team because of their low numbers. And just like trans athletes, most athletes have something in their body (like being extra tall, or fast) that gives them the ability to make it so high in the first place. So in conclusion, if you wanted to make sports ""fair"", then ban 90% of all athletes making sports officially boring
Oooh so is that why that texas high school forced Mack Beggs to fucking body cis girls on the girls wrestling team once he started T bc they wouldnt allow him to wrestle on the boys team?? Is this why transphobes used videos of that and called him a trans woman to push this argument that they need to protect girls like it wasnt their own design to hurt cis girls in order to maintain transphobia??? 

EDIT Mack fought this the entire time and they still put him and his opponents thru this for *years* (literally until he graduated) and proved cis girls are just collateral damage to them if it means maintaining transphobic status quos. Protecting the girls in this case would have been letting Mack play on the boys team, but they refused to let that happen and in the process blatantly showed their true motives

Based take, gamergirlpee69
How dare you question the importance given to these almost inexistant issues by our elected officials? Questioning how they spend our taxes on top of that? What's next? Voting rights?!?!

It seems that some people really care about holding on to their moral panic. 🤨
They also ignore the fact that after a significant amount of time on HRT, that advantage is reversed.
“The government needs to get out of my business but needs to get deep into yours”
I always find so stupid that argument of 'male puberty' like just because someone were through male puberty automatically get super strength
Remember guys, all they want is the smallest federal government possible to invade everyone's privacy to prevent people from exercising basic rights like doctor/patient confidentiality or playing school sports.
I know there’s no actual real advantage for trans people. But would it not just be easier to sort sports by weight or height? That means people will be even no matter what.
Touch my nerves UwU. Also I agree with you.
Their argument is a great one for why we should allow access to puberty blockers
In Kansas, I remember hearing that the transgender sports ban would affect all of 2 people.
Brought to you by the party of small government!
Just mention trans, in any capacity. Even if refered to others and not yourself, and you'll be downvoted for being the minority.

Love the human race.
So I don’t know if this is the right place to ask, but what’s everyone’s take on making all sports co-ed? 

I think they’re are plenty of cis-women that can physically compete in a cis-man sport. So then everyone plays regardless of sex or gender.
114 down votes?? Damn, I'm jealous. I never figured out how to upset hundreds of people so easily. Teach me please.
The party of self-regulation and personal responsibility can't deal with middle school girls soccer being self-regulated. Bunch of hypocrites.
It's unfortunate, too, because ***they're dead wrong.*** Having to go through a male puberty before a female one provides *no advantage.* In fact, estrogenic puberty in a body naturally inclined towards an androgenic one tends to come with side effects that affect the field of sport far more than any perceived ""advantage"". 

For starters, trans women tend to have lower testosterone and hemoglobin levels compared to cis women. Given the fact that testosterone and hemoglobin are essential for recovery after heavy exercise, we're actually at a *disadvantage* when it comes to elite sport. Any form of gender transition hormonally also tends to come with increased insulin resistance, which makes it more difficult to put on muscle and easier to put on fat. It also has detrimental effects on bone density and joint health, meaning trans people in general will have shorter competitive careers than their cis counterparts before having to retire for their own health.

The reality is that trans folks are at a disadvantage in sport. Anyone that says otherwise simply isn't versed on the most up-to-date science, and should be pointed towards the list of trans olympians so they can quickly shut up.
So looked into it and Olympic level scientists whose responsibility is ensuring fairness (via blood doping testing, drug screening etc) cannot say that being transgender provides an unfair advantage or not (seems to depend on the specific sport).

Their reason.  There just isn't enough trans athletes (sample size would be too small).  And if that's what people whose job is ensuring biological/chemical fairness are saying, then wtf are these non-expert lawmakers basing their policies off of?
Bigotry, pure and simple.
Republicans:  We support small, limited government and trust organizations to regulate themselves.

Also Republicans: ...NO NOT LIKE THAT!!! 😱😱😱
honestly? skill issue for the other athletes
Funny how going through female puberty reverses male puberty, which is totally not scientifically backed.
Even the Olympics recognizes trans athletes and base which gender you compete in by hormone levels
Correct me if I'm wrong here, but wasn't there a study showing that trans girls that went through HRT had a higher estrogen level than cis women and thus had a disadvantage in sports?
How about we talk about the real solution here, let trans kids take HRT during puberty and this wouldn’t be an issue! But nope! They just want to force trans kids to develop with what they’re born as just to further their agenda.
conservatives when they talk publicly: ""big government bad! we're the party of freedom!""

conservatives in their legislation: ""let us choose exactly how you live your life""
I love how they claim to “know the subject” yet can’t seem to grasp that taking estrogen actually has an effect on muscle mass and such
Sounds like the conservatives that don't like ""Big Government/regulations"" only dislike them when it fits their narrative
I find it very funny that the people who claim to believe in small government are also the people who want to have the state ban me from playing dodgeball
I mean doesn't evidence also show any """"""advantage"""""" male puberty gives people pretty much gets undone with hrt???
You get lots of love from reddit when you support trans people outside of LGBT+ subs..
So I believe that person made those studies up and if they didn't there probably still wouldn't be enough data to call it conclusive. If I remember correctly it's shown that women who compete in sports usually have higher testosterone levels than men that compete in those same sports regardless of what gender they were assigned at birth. Also there is no evidence that transitioning in either direction affects performance positively in any sport. Of course there isn't much evidence either way considering there isn't a huge population of trans people to begin with and only a percentage of them would be interested in sports and an even smaller percentage would be willing to be studied properly. So sample sizes are limited.
Whatever happened to “small government”?
Personally, I like the idea that we stop segregating sports by gender and instead group kids (and adults, for that matter) by either ability or other physiological factors relevant to each sport,  like how combat sports have weight classes.
i was arguing with someone in instagram comments or something
and i said “i think trans women are women should be able to use the women’s restroom and play on women sports teams. transgender people deserve to be treated like the rest of us”

and the person i was arguing with was like
“im not talking about transgender im talking about gender fluid they are so different 🙄🙄 anyway i dont want men in my prisons what if i man lies and says he identifies as a woman and-“

and they just  k e p t  g o i n g

i do not think they know what genderfluid means
The “people should be able to make their own rules without the government’s interference” crowd when the choices the majority make aren’t in their favor.
Most American sports teams are run by local governments, called school boards.     

The privately run leagues like the NFL, NBA, and MLB allow women to join.
At this point we should be just fucking banning sports altogether. This is a joke, but like... I fucking hate competitive sports. Why does it matter? We don't go mad over ""best blue cheese"" competitions, why can't we be more like blue cheese? ""Sports integrity"" stuff annoys me to no end because I genuinely *do not care*, it is the most unimportant issue in the whole of the Milky Way galaxy and half of Andromeda. Someone's always gonna be ""the best"", and that we are making it into some competition is beyond me.

Bit of a hot take and probably somewhat fueled by my tiny speck of experience, I just can't with these OOOO SPOORTSSSS people. Not everything has to be an ""us vs them"". I'd gladly choose to never ever hear a thing about sports again if this means these people stop justifying transphobia with it.
They're so obsessed with hating us.
LMFAO @ “Daddy Government”
I don’t get why we have to have gender in sports at all. Separation should only be about skill level
They need to show me the studies they are reffering to and I wpuld LOVE to say why these studies can't be taken seriously. Literally the ""n"" is a far too low number, the participants are nowhere near identical (seriously some take trans atlethes and cis people who sometimes do sports and compare them...), the organisation behind it isn't neutral etc.

EVERY study on that matter can't be taken serious.

If we now take a look on what is happening in reality there is NO UNFAIR ADVANTAGE ANYWHERE! Seriously...when a trans woman wins or has a new record (which is nowhere near a world record almost every time except once, which was beaten already) they either were a very good atlethe beforehand (sometimes the number of the place would be lower, but if you look at the number of people doing that sport, the percentage stays the same) and/or are training sometimes even harder than others. Some people were close to records before transitioning as well and lost SO MUCH time etc. by transitioning.

Now the next part: People who are tall have an advantage in basketball, but not every person who is tall is good in basketball or is dominating. Seriously...
There was once a tennis player who had longer arms than usual and actually dominated the sport. No word has been said there about an unfsir advantage.

NEXT next part: People never cared about womens sport and when they would, they would literally REALLY support it instead of fighting trans woman, who have no advantage after 1 year HRT. Like make it more popular, that they don't have to wear almost no clothing, that it's taken more serious, good training gear and places etc. etc.

Next NEXT next point: Let kids have fun? HELLO?! It's not like they are competing for money?!
I don't like that government officials are so down on LGBTQIA  folks. that they spend hours talking about how our children should play sports. But it is also people who voted for these people saying that we are forcing our lifestyle upon them. . . .mhm.
Does Reddit stop counting downvotes at some point? I feel like the downvote count should be higher with how many people upvoted the person you responded to (and just how transphobic most of Reddit can be) lol

If not, you likely got quite a few upvotes to counter the downvotes. So there's that at least. Maybe a few people in cis Reddit have more than 2 braincells to rub together after all lol
r/rimjob_steve
Amazingly these ""can see both sides"" geniuses never get far enough to consider that sports are inherently unfair and boxing and wrestling are the only sports to really do something about it, and for all they're knowledge of science they never look at the statistical evidence that trans women haven't shown a significant advantage over cis women. It's almost like centrists talk out of their fucking asses!
I’m really tired of these post on this sub. I get it Reddit is transphobic. The world is transphobic. It’s sucks how much people misunderstand us as people.
If people are really, *really* so concerned with parity among athletes for the sake of competitive advantages, then implement leagues based off of physical tests of ability and ignore anything else. All of the arguments surrounding gender in sports is nothing more than fear of being shown up by someone that some folks want to perceive as lesser.

This absolutely blows my mind, because as a cis guy I'm under no illusions that there aren't a tremendous amount of cis women who could kick my ass at any number of sports! The only way I could ever be competitive and enjoy my time playing is if there was a league exclusively for asthmatic twinks so I wouldn't be the only one having a coughing fit on the field.

Sports have never been ""fair"" in the slightest, and it's incredibly demeaning that people continue this charade that they ever were.
Well I've gone through male puberty I'm 60 years old and I guarantee you a lot of cisgender women most cisgender women are stronger than I am
Could we just abolish gendered teams and organize sports by weight class?
For professionals, sure, have some regulations

For kids though? They’re kids. Let em play ball
It’s almost like they hate that you’re right
Oh, I would've never guess reddit had so many Carers About Women's Sports™.
Lol yep you hit that nerve at least 100 times good job
It pisses me off so much because if you look at so many successful athletes today they also have curtain things that might make them better at that thing, take Micheal Phelps, he’s hyper mobile in his shoulders so his arms can move more than his competitors, like if we remove everyone that has something that might increase their skills at something, sports would look totally different today
why are you booing her, she’s right!
Thats a very libertariany position which is by the way hated by both typical right and left wing people so you're probably not only getting downvotes from people who disagree with your premise but also for your political view
Cishets are a plague 🙃
Its indeed a conundrum. In America, its important that kids play outside.  This is most important. For excersize and to learn to get along with each other. 

We are too unhealthy a society. If the league plays M&F then its a no brainer. If its is a male league again a no brainer as the best players play period. Well usually. If a F league maybe more thought.  But overall very few players will ever be college level or even pro.  Which means a lot of money is involved and again the best play.  

Another thought is if the player is way to good then maybe play in a male league? If someone is that good then usually the next level up wants them until it balance the competitive level or becomes pro. 

Sports and the military and court system solved the racial divide. Now this too can be worked out. 

Talk wont solve this. Play ball.
the male strong that female arguments is pointless, someone is always faster, or stronger, and most of this is some parent crabbing about the daughter losing to a trans athlete, like they were losing a scholarship or something 

if the trans athlete came in last........... crickets
[removed]
Severely disagree with that guy, I think kids should be educated n brought up to know the reality of their situation n at 16/17 then I'd say they can make an informed choice on their own truly, with as little family n community influence as possible.
I may be missing some context, but it seems you two are talking about two completely different scenarios.  The commenter is talking about post-pubescent competition.  You’re talking about pre-pubescent competition.  Kids up to a certain age can compete without any inherent advantage from puberty.  When boys hit puberty bone density increases, muscle mass increases, lung capacity increases, etc..  Tons of stuff happens to boys that doesn’t happen to girls.  Studies on in-shape trans and cis athletes have shown that after 2 years, trans athletes are still able to do 10 percent more push-ups and 6 percent more sit-ups than the cis athletes.  In the same time frame, trans athletes were still able to run 1.5 miles 12 percent faster than cis athletes.  It would take many years for this to be even remotely equal, and even then, trans women will still maintain the same bone density (which can be critically dangerous in contact sports) and heart/lung strength will exceed those in cis athletes.  Obviously if transition is begun BEFORE puberty (which is a completely different topic), advantage whether man or woman, will likely be negligent.  

Again, it seems like you two are arguing two completely different things.  You’re arguing for kids who have not hit puberty and are transitioning, the other person is arguing for those that have hit puberty before transitioning.
Just make the mainstream (men) open and you solved everything.

I get why different leagues exist, but female, young, etc athletes should have the option to compete in their protected league and the main one.
To be fair, your comment doesn’t address the issue of fairness at all, and therefore doesn’t contribute to the discussion.
Was that a discussion of general sports competition, school sports or a specific case of a kid? I don't quite get the point that is being discussed.
In the first case, I think I agree more with the first coment, and I can understand the downvote hate that went towards your comment, comming from that kind of people, but if its any of the 2 other cases I said, then you just entered a transphobic place and that's their way to tell you to run away as far as you can.
I agree with both statements being made
Actually, the studies, since the 90s, done on Olympic athletes, have ruled there is no advantage after ~2 years at 10 or less T iirc. So that guy can fuck off. Also, literally everyone has an unfair advantage in some way for something, nobody is equal, the best athletes are always the ones with an unfair advantage. And trans people have been competing for 30 years without dominating anything, so obviously we don't. It's just misogyny disguised as sympathy, they don't think women are capable, and they don't think we're women, so they think we *are* capable in a way a cis woman somehow can never be

Also yes, this is children, probably a small handful of children, it'll be fucking fine, just let them hang out with their friends. And uh, those puberty blockers they hate would help a ton at erasing this supposed issue
*blinks* i’m moving to the netherlands
Why should grown adults care about the sports activities of a high school they have no affiliation with? I hate that this is still considered an issue. And it feels extra dehumanizing now that these assholes are proudly attacking trans people in other ways too.
To think about it...

I was 5'3 or 5'4 in my teenage years I was playing football (soccer) in a academy, I was physically weaker than kids my age who are like 5'7 or even up to 5'10 to the point they had to put me with younger kids who match me physically.


Does that mean if I transitioned as a 5'6 AMAB and HRT made me physically weaker as Estrogen + T blockers = Significant muscle mass drop (and probably shrink few inches in height), will that make me prone to physical bullying by bigger and taller ""5'7 - 5'10"" cis girls?
MINUS114?!?
I will never understand why sports are relegated by sex. Why not, idk, weight class? if you wanna relegate it that way?
I blame our commitment to extreme levels of competition at early ages. If a trans person was in a ""fun league"", some dumb cunts would still give a shit even though competition isn't the point of the league.

Our parents spent 18+ years raising us to include everyone and respect the differences between each other. Now, they're mad that we wanna include everyone! Shit makes zero sense...
I don't know why, and I'm only speaking my mind and not criticizing anyone for sharing (because this is the only place I can actually speak my mind and be treated like a human), but this seems to be one of my triggers, the sight of so many people agreeing with something harmful and then downvoting something wholesome, especially when the thing being shit upon was said by and for trans people. I still make myself look at these things, because I can't be scared of words, but it's the feelings and the potential actions behind the words that frighten me so much.

It's like we stand up for ourselves and the rest of the world stands up only to scream, ""Sit down and shut the fuck up"" at us. Recently, I politely asked someone online not to call me ""dude"" and got told over and over by different Redditors that it's a gender neutral term. I didn't even say I wasn't male, just to please not call me that. It's disrespectful.

They're the reason I'm always armed and ready to explode. They have no idea what kind of people they're making us into.
I mean your take is kind of flawed. Nobody is talking about children playing a game on the playground. These are structured, competitive events with very real stakes (since sports is a major pathway for people to be able to afford school). I mean you’re otherwise correct, but “just let the kids figure it out” isn’t really a solution because they aren’t choosing who they play any more than a professional athlete does.
What happened to “men and women are equally strong”? Don’t hear the TERFs saying that anymore
Mainline reddit is so transphobic it would be comical in other circumstances
Why is the government regulating kids sports? I mean it seems overstepping by several miles.
as a transfem athlete i fully agree with your comment. i am still comfortable competing as a U18 boy on my sport of bowling. granted, many of the local tournaments are broken into divisions based on skill and not gender, but national scale contests i am registered as a male and, while checking that box makes me a bit dysphoric, i still feel more comfortable there than if i were in a female division. i’m a girl that is comfortable competing in the boys divisions, and i think that people should decide which division they want to compete in based off of nothing more than where they are comfortable. hell, we need to get rid of the gender barrier entirely, or at least through high school level sports.
Man shits not even hard we just start using skill brackets. Boom problem solved.
professional sports should be balanced tbh, but also, how many fucking trans atheletes are even there? Bro y'all banning a total of twenty people, just ignore the issue or something. Plus genetic mutations also give unfair advantages, so you're gonna ban cis women with natural advantages as well or what?
The ignorance is unreal. Say anything about sport and you basically have to delete your account and go into witness protection.
remember one of the only factors on where trans woman score higher then cis woman is grip strenght
Wow the ""small government supporters"" downvote someone talking about a small government
""no kid of mine shall have fun game with another kid of a different gender""
Cause Reddit is full of individual echo chambers. I am amazed how often I get downvoted for simple and not even controversial statements. Essentially if I say anything, and I mean anything, even slightly not the main talking point on the reddit, I will get downvoted and rhe only way to get upvoted a lot is make the same exact point or present the same idea eevryone else have. Reddit seems to be made for creating weird tribalist mindsets. I don’t even think you need to touch a nerve, just say something they even slightly disagree with. I said rhe other day I’d like to re-sign a certain player to my sports team, apparantly that was unpopular with that particular reddit group even though in other places it is a common take. Downvoted to hell.
Simple solution. Have 2 brackets. One for allies and 1 for homophobes. The one for allies has trans people and cis people. The one for homophobes is just that, plus in teack/marathons we have a lion chasing them, it'll push them to go as fast as possible
In the netherlands for amateur handball the rule is that you can play with mixed teams in a match if both teams agree to it. Usually they do
I think we need to start linking the posts. Trans takeover in the fucking comments
""party of small government"" MFs when someone provides a practical solution to government intervention on a certain contentious topic (they don't actually believe in small government anymore, they just want to hate people and will use the government as an excuse to do that)
And of course most of these bans involve high school sports, and if they would stop getting out of the way, a lot of these trans kids could avoid ""male puberty"" all together. 

The point is exclusion. The point is cruelty. They hate us and want us to be forced to stay in the closet because we make them uncomfortable.
We can't have unfair advantages in a thing that is all about unfair advantages!
Why do people downvote actually good coments/post down so much. Like wtf.
It wasn't even about competitive
Side note i don’t think there’s a one rule for all possibility
Which arrows do I press? I am so confused. XD
I think of these laws as insults. Not just to trans people but to sports teams and leagues. Y'all really think they are so incompetent that the government has to spend taxpayer dollars to legislate rules when the leagues are perfectly capable of coming up with their own rules? Rules that are informed by actual medical research rather than politician opinions...
Why did he get so many down votes? He raises a good point it shouldent matter.
It's almost like they never cared about the kids in the first place
The average mildly transphobic Redditor thrives on the idea that this transgender stuff is just too complicated.  Makes them feel smart for having an opinion and wise for not actually doing anything.

My usual go to is equally simple and agreeable and it also gets down voted: the point of school sports is to keep kids healthy, off drugs, and making friends.  How does banning trans kids contribute to any of those goals?
No, they're defensively ignorant
Sometimes you'll even get downvoted for saying the definition of a word, it's weird. On another account I got ~100 downvotes for saying the definition of a TERF. Neutrally.
If I think of any of my highschool coaches I would not trust a single one of them to do whats best for a student that deviates from the stock standard athlete stereotype. I would absolutely want someone above them on the hierarchy enforcing that they treat everyone equally or in a fair manner in some way.

Not to mention what do you do if one team is okay with a trans athlete and another team in the same league and region isn't? There's got to be an overarching decision made here on how to handle these issues, leaving it to teams to handle themselves just feels like a terrible idea all around. I'm not seeing any upsides to this posts opinion and I'm reaaaally not seeing it being a favorable setup for trans kids in this current climate.

And have you heard of Semolina Castor? Trying to take her olpymic win away because she /naturally/ has more testosterone than other women.
[deleted]
Michael Phelps? You mean the CHEATING genetic FREAK that DESTROYED men's swimming?
But think of the parents living vicariously through their kids! They’ll never be able to live their dreams through their kid!
And their ""scientific studies"" are bullshit anyways. There are already studies regarding transgender athletes and trans women, once on HRT for enough time, perform close to cis women, or worse.

It's even been observed with Lia Thomas and her ""unbeatable"" records that got beaten recently as well as losing recently, but that's not news for them since they just want fuel for polarizing this issue.
> people don't place bets on high school football games.

I see you're not from Texas.
I played sports in middle and high school and I can assure you I’ve never fit the definition of “athlete”, it’s not like every athlete on that field was equally good, some guys who barely ever practiced were wildly above the skill and strength level of other people on my team. Sports in middle and high school aren’t very fair to begin with
Oh they already do that. Cis girl with too much t? Banned unless she takes t blockers. Intersex? Have to compete with men. Chromosomal sex disorder? Better get thorough testing to make sure there’s no unfair advantage. Have to keep those cis girls protected from unfairness.
Going through HRT is literally eroding my bones and muscle mass (and my doctor told me this would happen) there is absolutely no advantage to cis women if u are taking estrogen. I meet dozens of cis women that are stronger than me and more athletic every day
But let's face it: the Olympics is still just for fun. They're not solving any real world problems except the need to entertain people.
Sport is all about advantages. That being said, there are a few protected advantages. Namely age, sex, and disability. Kids, females, and the disabled all struggle to win against adults, males, and able bodied people respectively in many sports. So they each have their protected leagues, so they can still win. 

You mention banning athletes with advantages. At least most people I have seen, that isn’t the goal. It’s just to keep the protected leagues protected. People with advantages can still play in the general, non protected leagues. If you are concerned about people in the general leagues having advantages, then we should make more protected leagues. I’m not sure what advantages you have in mind to separate though.

Now if you think advantages aren’t an issue, then that would mean we should get rid of the protected leagues and just force everyone to play together. Athletes in those leagues are definitely not a fan of that proposal though.

Also idk what high school you went to, but a lot of high schools it is more than just “fun and exercise”, they get extremely competitive. Just because you or I don’t care as much about the sports doesn’t mean people should be allowed to do whatever they want.
The thing is, this reductive argument means that inherently, the argument even if we win it still leaves open the fight against college and Olympic level athletes. Yes, it's shite, but it will happen.

So we need to kill this outright. The fact is that this argument is pretty universally blown apart by medicine. The catch is something where, say, height gives an advantage or something, but to be honest, that just means that you're still leaving open to cis athletes who are above that height, and you know they won't have a problem with them.
Conservatives don't conserve anything, they circumvent.
Nono, you see, big government is if they regulate something **I** am doing. If the government doesn't disctiminate against trans people, they are going to impact **my** abbility to feel smug about being an ass to them, or even outlaw harrassing them, and if you think about it, isn't that a form of big government?
Or let those trans kids start HRT around the time their puberty would start, therefore eliminating any potential advantage they would have and alleviate them of discomfort. Oh, against that too huh?
My favorite thing is when you adjust for height and weight, the difference goes away. Trans women on average have an advantage over cis women because they are taller on average.
Heres an interesting [article from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/08/the-golden-ratio-the-one-number-that-describes-how-mens-world-records-compare-with-womens/260758/) comparing men’s and women’s world records in swimming and running.

Here’s my takeaway from the article: at the highest level of competition there absolutely is a difference between men’s and women’s performances, but it’s not ALL because of physical differences. 

Look, as a former D1 distance runner, it’s hard not say that men have a physical advantage over women. Running is the most fundamental sport out there, strictly based on physical ability and grit. Men’s times were consistently better than women’s by a significant margin, so imo it’s not fair to ignore the innate biological differences (because women certainly don’t have less grit). This does not mean I support testosterone testing or any of that other wild invasive shit. Additionally I think this only applies in high level competition scenes, when it come to kids, just let them play for fks sake! Now on the other hand, the whole Leah Thomas thing. Call me a bigot, but yes, I found that to be a bit of an issue. I want everyone to feel included and be able to participate in athletics, sports are awesome, I just don’t think it is as simple as “I identify as x so I should be able to compete against x”.

But let me finish. This article highlights a belief I’ve held for a long time - the difference in men & women’s sports has a significant societal factor. The article highlights how the gap between men’s and women’s world records is shrinking, largely in part to the increased promotion/encouragement of women’s sports. “the success of any nation's elite athletic program springs from its ability to support, select and train its anomalies.” Essentially I believe that with equal support, promotion, and access to resources, women can compete at a level much more similar to men, but there is a innate biological advantage in a biological male body.

TLDR: this conversation IS nuanced in regards to adult competition. Men consistently outperform women in fundamental sports like running & swimming, indicating a biological factor, but, societal factors, like the promotion of women’s sports, also plays a significant role in that performance gap.
Trans men are invisible unfortunately
Ugh they’ll probably just say transmascs are all “too weak” and “too delicate” to compete with the cis men too. Look at boxing, they’ll only let trans people box each other.
[deleted]
It's transphobia meets mysogyny. ""Trans people aren't real, and men are superior to women."" 🤮
Thank you for this!
> Recent studies show there is no clear advantage, if at all, for trans (mtf) athletes.

wow you mean recycled misogyny is bullshit ? 
i am shocked
The study says there’s no clear advantage primarily due to a lack of proper studies. It’s not arguing that there is no advantage, it’s saying that we can’t argue that there is one.
Yeah, almost everyone arguing against trans women in women's sports assumes that 100% of people born with a dick are just AUTOMATICALLY 100% stronger, faster, and better than ANY person born with a vagina and always will be.  They think a trans woman will break every bone in a cis woman's body playing volleball or some shit and they completely lack any understanding on what HRT does.  The reality is that many of us trans women are *not* as strong as many cis women.  I play a number of sports and I am not beating up cis women, lol.  I was not even close to the best player on the volleyball team I was playing on, but morons just completely ignore this and assume that all trans women are testosterone fueled monsters.

Oh, and it's almost certainly always cis and straight men claiming trans women can't play sports (and legislating our rights away) in an effort to pRoTeCt WoMeN bEcAuSe ThEyRe WeAk.  Not only is it transphobic, but it's also sexist to assume that cis women ""need"" the protection these chuds are 'offering'.  I wish they would shut the fuck up and let us women resolve it (in the case of trans women in women's sports, trans men in men's sports is would obviously have male voices involved).

Not to mention this ENTIRE SUBJECT is built upon the *false* notion that trans women are dominating high end sports (even Lea Thomas wasn't dominating, she won like a couple of events and lost a bunch more), and these chuds are using that to then take rights away from ALL of us, when most of us that want to play sports just want to play sports in school or locally.
That’s an “expert opinion,” not a study.  Studies have shown that some “advantages” that a male-at-birth holds are irreversible after puberty, while others take many many years to reverse.
Happy cake day!🎂
For one, WWE is scripted.  And two, you did not train to be in WWE.  You’re comparing yourself, who has never “wrestled” WWE a day in your life, vs people who make millions off of it for being popular
This is one of the very few “conservative” stances I have but there really is an advantage to being a cis man when it comes to some sports. For example I ran track and field in high school. If I competed as a trans woman without taking hormones, I would’ve been one of, if not the fastest women in the history of the sport. Instead I wasn’t even the fastest in my high school. You could say it’s because there’s less girls running track and field, but in my school there were more people on the girls team than the boys.

Edit: it might be better to say that I believe having high levels of testosterone is an advantage not being a cis male
(cis) men are genetically stronger than (cis) women. Sure some women will be stronger and more athletic than many men but, on average, (cis) men are stronger. 

The reason people stress about trans people in female leagues is because of the advantage trans women have over cis women. 

I complexity agree that that female sports should have batter acres to funding and facilities, but that has nothing to do with why people “stress about the trans community in sports”.

So like divisions based on skill? That would kinda suck for women though. For sports like track and swimming where testosterone just puts you on another level, literally all people with low T would be in low classes where people would presumably not be very interested in watching. I mean sadly people aren’t interested in women’s sports as it is. But it sounds cooler to say you’re the women’s champ then the division 8 champ or whatever it would be.

Government small enough to fit in your underwear or crawl into your ear.
She wasn't even good enough to be an Olympic swimmer, she was decent-to-good in the NCAA. (Obviously a huge achievement and she should be very proud, just wanted to emphasize that she wasn't a prodigy or anything.) Cis Olympic swimmers would wipe the floor (skim the pool?) with her.
Right?  Like boxing or wrestling (I think, at high school level anyway) do.  That's why I'm confused by that specific argument:  there are various non-transphobic solutions that would adequately solve that potential issue (even like that original response of ""hey maybe let the actual organizations sort that out instead of laws?"").

Of course it's never about the argument... Hating trans people is an attempt to stay relevant to conservatives by appealing to hatred of ""things they don't understand but are asked to accept"" and they don't wanna...
I don’t think sorting sports by weight or height is sufficient. There are good reasons for having categories such as age, gender, or disabilities in sports. If not young able bodied men would would win at every weight and height class. It would marginalize groups, such as women or the disabled,  who are already sidelined in sports.

Depends on the subreddit tbh
Well, I’m a trans woman and I was in a lesbian subreddit which aparently was transphobic (I had no idea cuz the 2 “main” lesbian subreddits I use ain’t transphobic, just commenting there did the same to my comments, straight down to -50 atleast with every post (cuz my account clearly says I’m a trans woman)
Testosterone is not the determining factor on whether or not one has an advantage.
Litterally This, except the voice part from what I’ve heared, voice stays low(I think?)
I don't think its all that libertarian to think the government has better things to do than make the rules for a game
Please list all of the professional trans athletes who have completely dominated a sport to the alarming extent that no cis woman could ever hope to challenge the record.

Keep in mind that trans folks have been allowed to compete at the highest level for over a decade at this point.
Show me the study and I will tell you why that study can't be taken serious. Most of the time it's the ""n"" which isn't even over 40.

Edit: I can't answer your comment the link is in because reddit doesn't show me, so I'll do it here and edit my comment later:

29 trans men and 46 trans women....compared to EVERYONE under 30...you see the flaw here? The n is too small...again...and they were even smaller on some tests, because some didn't even attempt that.

The age: We don't know the average age of the cis group, where fun fact: Also trans people could have been involved, because it was a statistic about EVERYONE from the time 2004 and 2014.

Also other factors weren't taken serious like height etc. so being tall could be the advantage instead or disadvantage in some places, instead of being trabsgender or cisgender. Also like I said: trans people could already be in the numbers they compare it on, since they didn't take them thenselves. They are allowed since the year 2000 so it's not only possible, the chances are very high.
Also the different backgrounds weren't taken serious. Some people did lots of sports before they went to the army, some didn't.

I don't need to take a deeper look inside, that's already enough to say that that study is crap and can't be taken serious, because the groups are neither really comparable, the ""n"" is far too low and they compare trans people with cis and trans people?!

Edit 2: Since I can't answer you AGAIN, I will edit my comments later again:

Seriously yes you can't have a good ""n"" value, that's true. But you can take a look into reality and see that no trans woman is dominating anything or has an unfair advantage. According to that study we would have much more trans women who would be excellent at sprint even dominating naybe, but we don't.

Saying that there are ""so many studies saying there is an advantage"" while the groups cant be compared is like saying ""There are many studies saying that atlethes have an advantage to people doing sport sometimes"". You can't compare these groups. Also ""in my study with n=10 you can see that 10% of people are trans, because one was trans""...you can't take such low numbers serious.



Also studies saying that there is no evidence of an unfair advantage:

Seriously there are no studies you can take serious as evidence that there is an advantage. Because of that we have to take a look at the reality. The reality says there is no unfair advantage. It's that easy.

Edit 3: Same thing, different comment:

If ""evidence"" (you should say studies and I will use it like that, because the evidence literally shows that. You know, reality?) would say there is no advantage or disadvantage but the ""n"" would be too low or let me add: they are not comparable, YES that study can't be taken serious as well. There was a study who said that trans women would have a disadvantage against cis women (couldn't find it that fast) but I know that you couldn't take it serious as well, so I didn't bother to continue to search it. Just so you know that this even exists....

When the study is a serious study where the things being compared and the ""n"" is reasonable, then you can take it serious. Then you can also take some other studies more serious with less ""n"", but you should still be very careful about the numbers.

If there are many studies with a low ""n"" like 50 BUT the things which get compared CAN actually be compared, were well done and the results are almost identical, then you could take it more serious as well.

That doesn't happen with the studies about sport tho, because you cant compare 100.000 people with 40...or 30... Seriously when I take 40 people and one of them is trans, then 2,5% of all people would be trans. If I take 40 people and 12 of them are women, you don't have the world population of women which would be 30%. 

You also cant compare someone who did sport their whole life and multiple days a week with someone who didn't or does it once a week. These studies do exactly that all the time. Also the height difference etc. is almost never taken serious just like many other factors. Muscle mass on taller people are different to people who are smaller. All these things can be read in the links I send you, where I'm sure you didn't even read one of them.

Edit 4: You know how that works and Reddit:

It's not only the ""n"" mate, that's what I'm trying to tell you bit you don't get it. YOU CAN'T COMPARE SOMEONE WHO DID SPORT FOR A YEAR WITH SOMEONE WHO DID IT THEIR WHOLE LIFE...the study you showed LITERALLY also has trans men and women in the cis men and women group and that was a whole different time than when the trans people were tested. The study has so much flaws and can't be taken serious by it.

YES HEIGHT CAN BE AN ADVANTAGE that's why most people at basketball are tall. BUT you aren't automatically good at basketball only because you are tall. Also maybe I forgot to give you another source but over 70% of female atlethes say that trans women don't have an advantage, so YES EVEN MOST ATLETHES SAY THAT. You argue on things which are just not the real world but made up in your mind. And why do most athletes say that? Because the advantages like height is  something cis women can also have and trans women can also be small. Also you need a lot of training, these things don't make you automatically better. ALSO in rugby for example being tall has advantages AND disadvantages, that's also a reason.

Also they said that noone ever compared cis and trans women with the same height like that and with the muscle mass, since when you are taller that works a bit different. They said that but you choose to ignore it.

Edit: Again I will edit later:

You don't know shit and come to conclusions which are just dump. You really believe what some people say without proper research...damn...do your own proper research next time please...

First of all: When someone would have qualified for the olympics and transitions then, ofc they would be still in the olympics after they would be allowed to compete with their gender.

If someone trained to go there but would never have made it, then they wouldn't even after transitioning, the only exception maybe: There aren't enough competitors in the first place in that sport.

And because you STILL don't understand it: There. is. no. unfair. advantage.
The body in some fields could be an advantage, yes but cis women especially in olympics have a body like that as well. That's what you don't get.

About powerlifting: She never broke a world record, in fact even her best attempts were not that near of it. With her best ever attempts she would have been 2nd place at the olympics nowhere near the world record which got broken there as well, but she was at the last place. She broke records for the places she was in and not even by much. That's right.

To Lia Tjomas I will copy and paste another comment since I don't have enough nerves to explain someone everything ober and ober again, just because you wanna believe in made up crap: 

Lia thomas was a top ranked US mens swimmer before she started HRT. She then dropped by several hundred positions in the rankings whem she started HRT. When she was allowed to switch divisions, she was a top ranked US womens swimmer.
Muscle mass atrophies on HRT, and trans women have to train harder than cis women to build or maintain muscle, as cis women actually have higher T levels. 

Lia Thomas may be a bit more muscular than the average cis woman but she proabably puts in about 1.2-1.4x the effort to maintain that than the average cis woman.  And according to her competitors she actually did exactly that.

A lot of people have talked about trans womans advantages in sport but if you actually look into the effects of HRT then you'll see that the only advantage you could potentially see is height, which to be honest more often than not gets balanced out by disadvantages that come with HRT. Height is also not always there and can be a disadvantge as well.

Also, Lia Thomas took adequate time before joining the womens division to ensure that her HRT had worked properly. 

She lost LOTS of time on every category, broke the record by almost nothing (she also almost did that while she competed against men with their times) and the same day in different categories she placed a lot lower in other categories. According to you she must have won there as well, but she didn't.

Lia Thomas is an outlier anyway, there are loads of trans women who compete in womens sports who are ranked super low in their respective sports, and nobody bats an eye.

It's not about the advantage anyway, its about who's allowed to win. Let me explain;

When black men were first allowed to compete in competetive sports in the US, specifically snprints, the primary argument against allowing black people to compete was that those of african heritage were had a biological advantage and were faster than white people, and that should mean it would be unfair. This was, you guessed it, thinley veiled racism. 

When the womens sharpshooting was introduced to the Olympics, there wasn't a major issue. Until a particular athlete, I believe the one from China, started performing far too well. Not cheating, of course, just extremely skilled. Some of the mens division players and their staff still called for her removal.

Now lets look at the other side of the story. Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian we have on record, with 23 gold medals in mens swimming. He has a very unusual wingspan, and large hands. His body also produces a lot less lactic acid than others. These are ACTUAL biological advantages. Phelps doesn't have to take medicine to fix his lactic acid production though, or wear equipment that reduces the advantage from his wingspan. Why aren't people upset about it? Because he's white and a dude.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

She broke records for the places she was in and not even by much. That's right.

To Lia Tjomas I will copy and paste another comment since I don't have enough nerves to explain someone everything ober and ober again, just because you wanna believe in made up crap: 

Lia thomas was a top ranked US mens swimmer before she started HRT. She then dropped by several hundred positions in the rankings whem she started HRT. When she was allowed to switch divisions, she was a top ranked US womens swimmer.
Muscle mass atrophies on HRT, and trans women have to train harder than cis women to build or maintain muscle, as cis women actually have higher T levels. 

Lia Thomas may be a bit more muscular than the average cis woman but she proabably puts in about 1.2-1.4x the effort to maintain that than the average cis woman.  And according to her competitors she actually did exactly that.

A lot of people have talked about trans womans advantages in sport but if you actually look into the effects of HRT then you'll see that the only advantage you could potentially see is height, which to be honest more often than not gets balanced out by disadvantages that come with HRT. Height is also not always there and can be a disadvantge as well.

Also, Lia Thomas took adequate time before joining the womens division to ensure that her HRT had worked properly. 

She lost LOTS of time on every category, broke the record by almost nothing (she also almost did that while she competed against men with their times) and the same day in different categories she placed a lot lower in other categories. According to you she must have won there as well, but she didn't.

Lia Thomas is an outlier anyway, there are loads of trans women who compete in womens sports who are ranked super low in their respective sports, and nobody bats an eye.

It's not about the advantage anyway, its about who's allowed to win. Let me explain;

When black men were first allowed to compete in competetive sports in the US, specifically snprints, the primary argument against allowing black people to compete was that those of african heritage were had a biological advantage and were faster than white people, and that should mean it would be unfair. This was, you guessed it, thinley veiled racism. 

When the womens sharpshooting was introduced to the Olympics, there wasn't a major issue. Until a particular athlete, I believe the one from China, started performing far too well. Not cheating, of course, just extremely skilled. Some of the mens division players and their staff still called for her removal.

Now lets look at the other side of the story. Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian we have on record, with 23 gold medals in mens swimming. He has a very unusual wingspan, and large hands. His body also produces a lot less lactic acid than others. These are ACTUAL biological advantages. Phelps doesn't have to take medicine to fix his lactic acid production though, or wear equipment that reduces the advantage from his wingspan. Why aren't people upset about it? Because he's white and a dude.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

Edit: And again since you don't get it or don't wanna get it: YOU DON'T HAVE SCIENTIFIC PROOF. Don't be so stubborn. It's like saying I have scientific proof that 4 in 10 people are trans because my friend group is like that. We competed in sports, even tho someone wasn't there and only 3 people do sports on a regular basis. We found out that the one who did it on a regular basis have an unfair advantage, we should ban doing sport on a regular basis. That's literally what your studies were doing. 

Your conclusion on that studies were therefore not only not based on evidence and science but made up.
Also you didn't even do right research about the people you put your conclusion onto. You believe what someone said and other repeated a lot of times, even when it's just half of the story. There is much more behind it and literally some things you thought happening there were blatantly wrong.

THAT indeed makes you look like you don't have a clue since your evidence is either no evidence and that has been proven by studies I showed you or is false information you somehow read up.
If that is really all you can do, I wouldn't start an argument or tell crap about such a complicated topic which is used to strip trans people of rights like in the USA, where there is literally the start of a genocide happening (let's hope it doesn't happen completly).

I repeated myself again and again and again and you didn't WANT to understand it or you didn't read it or didn't want to read it. That's what I said. Seriously if you can't read what I wrote or didn't wanna read and understand it and the science behind it, that's on you. Yes you put me into a position I always had to repeat myself ofc I get frustrated with you. You really don't know anything about the topic except the very surface and make conclusion based on that. THAT IS indeed not knowing shit for me.

It's like I'm saying I know all about chemistry, when in fact I don't know shit there.

Seriously try to learn what is really happening in the real world and try to think more critically and do proper research. Like seriously you told me things and I had evidence that you are wrong. For example you said that athlethes would say that trans women have an advantage when in fact more than 70% of cis female atlethes say they don't. 

EVEN THE PEOPLE YOU TRY TO DEFEND AREN'T ON YOUR SIDE, because what you said is simply not true.

Let them know we stand together and are tired of this bullshit.
The issue is they care more about the ""integrity"" of their sport than they do about the kids.

 Sportball is more important than children don't you know that!? /s
Truth
Nor sports. No where itn the conversation the building of teamwork and sportsmanship.

Just pearl clutching that a ""neutral person"" might be at a disadvantage against one of the weirdos, and we can't have that.
Or about small government.
> The average mildly transphobic Redditor thrives on the idea that this transgender stuff is just too complicated. Makes them feel smart for having an opinion and wise for not actually doing anything.

You know, I agree - but I always find it pretty fucking wild when ""this thing is too complicated for me"" is a premise and the conclusion is ""therefor I'm smarter than everyone else"".
It depends on the school or school system. Because some are so highly praised and sought-after that for that momentum to continue, they'd have to be continually recognized and sponsored while proving their pedigree each time.

When money is involved is when people will nit-pick at every and any detail. Including trans-children. So it's no surprise that the bell was rung and everyone at the table is now arguing about this. There surely were sponsor-funded schools who thought it's all unfair. Because after all, why wouldn't we separate the well-off schools from the mediocre ones in separate leagues or groupings? This only support's OP's viewpoint that regardless the competition, if you want to win then you learn how to through strategy and training. Allocating the team's strengths appropriately.

My high school's teams got only local sponsored monetary support. Rest of the money came from fundraising efforts and some from school district budget planning. But despite that, I can't help to feel they also would have rejected transgendered athletes purely on concept alone.
or maybe... just, let the kid play on whichever team they are comfortable on. if they're disadvantaged ability wise, oh well. at least they're happy and included.
this just in!! ""supporting your kids personal decisions makes you a shit parent"". do you hear yourself? no one is saying that they should be able to do whatever the fuck they  want all the time, we're saying that they're still humans, they're still people, they should still be able to make basic decisions for themselves.
And blatantly misgendering her is a popular pastime among a certain type of right-wing nutjob.
>And have you heard of Semolina Castor

Do you mean Caster Semenya by any chance..?
Just a slight correction. Semolina is a grain. I believe you meant Caster Semenya.
Hurting cis people is always the result of trying to gatekeep trans people.. Of course bigots don't really care about that, hurting weirdos is the point - and collateral damage against non-conforming people is always acceptable.
Too much testosterone = not a woman. But trans woman with lower testosterone than most cis woman = not a woman. It's almost like the system is rigged.
Some sports do some sports don't. Some sports even consider weights as an advantage. Basketball should have categories by height like how boxings have weight categories. But who am I to say about professional sports?

So I agree to let sports leagues regulate themselves.
Do you think genders shouldn’t be separated in sports? As long as they are the distinction between male and female will have to be made. 

Believe it or not there are stakes in athletics, even at the high school level. Scholarships and recruiting to schools is a big stake in high school athletics. If trans women are advantaged is that fair to cis women?
> You won't see them trying to move a 6 foot tall cis girl to the boy's basketball team for being too tall. People aren't mad about NBA players being well above average height, and that it's unfair to all the short people out there who love playing basketball.

I'm going to disclaimer up front that I 100% support trans women playing in women's leagues. That said, I'd imagine the reply to that would be that trans women are statistically more likely to be ~6 ft than AFAB players and out-proportion tall women. Again, I don't think it's a defensible stance because, among other things, I doubt there's enough trans women who want to play to even make a difference in any one league. 

I got into it once with someone on reddit about sports (probably about Lia Thomas) and tried explaining the effects of HRT after years and they started talking about bone density and the angle of people's joints. Frankly, if that's how deep you have to dig to support your argument then your argument is shit, but I've also given up on trying to get into it with these morons so... mission accomplished?
The Infamous Chowder Hound
It was hyperbole. I don't actually think athletes with advantages should be banned from playing, I was just trying to show the logical flaw in the reason they claim to want to ban trans athletes. I do not care enough about sports to have a full or nuanced opinion but I do think it is cruel to force a girl to play on boys' teams because she's ""too masculine"" and vice versa
To be honest I do not have as much of an opinion on banning trans people from professional sports as I do about banning trans people from casual sports teams and banning trans CHILDREN from getting exercise at school. There is a lot more nuance to banning trans people from certain Olympic games than I can possibly understand because frankly I just do not know (or care) much about how professional athleticism works. But banning trans people from non-professional leagues like high school or college where people are just meant to be having fun is stupid
They want to conserve their right to commit human rights violations with impunity
At lest here in germany, the term ""conservatove"" seems to fit them quite nicely. They are resistant to social change (""conserving"" the current state of things) and advocate against going in dept to invest in infrastructure, for example (""conserving"" money). The only thing they aren't conserving is the environment.

But the CDU has started drifting mire right after Merkel. To some extend, this was to be expected since they are now in the opposition, but i wonder if they will start alligning themself with the way american politics seems to work and start heavily relying on transphobia to create outrage and mobilize support.
Or, if a person is 5'3"" and transitions to female and wants to play basketball maybe we can acknowledge that they don't have a massive natural advantage and we should take that into account.

I hate the sentiment of the original post in those two comments because people use language that suggests they're just trying to be nuanced and make practical compromise, but as soon as you point out how, practically speaking, trans people's biology is a very grey area they shut down.

You either accept their implicit stereotype that trans women are all 7ft linebackers who can crush the skulls of cis women with their giant hands, or they won't entertain further discussion.
Lol right this is always my biggest point when talking to someone about it, you can't literally make it impossible for trans people to play sport and then frame it as fairness, because it isn't, you're just forcing people to choose between something they love and their own sanity
Let's not start kids on puberty hormones that early, y'all. Hormone blockers make a lot more sense as a first step.
don't tell them that, what if they realise bio sex isn't just hot dog and roll, what if they realise it's more?!
Bro, do you wanna know something fucking insane? I literally never disputed any of it. Professional sports PERIOD are not fair, never have been, economic and biological factors (even without the inclusion of sex) have always given some people an advantage over others, sometimes to extremes. NOBODY is disputing that evidently most men will have an advantage against most women- what we ARE arguing is that it is not and has never been just as simple as somebody's assigned sex. We are telling you that it is bigoted and it is unjust to ban trans people from sports on the basis of our sex when we can't do anything about it because seeking treatment as a minor is also now illegal! I started testosterone at 15, I am very lucky for this and my experience is not at all a common one, I am aware I could more than likely beat a cis woman at a good chunk of physical sports- especially being a rugby player before I started testosterone. You cannot tell somebody they have to choose between something they love and their own sanity and then try and frame it as fairness- it is not, it never has been.
Also- if you have to continuously try to stress that what you're saying isn't bigoted, even if the person on the other end tells you it is, it is probably bigoted. There is no attempt to make sports fair, the ban on trans people and trans children from participating is not about fairness, it is about alienation.
Honestly invisibility seems better than what the rest of LBTQ+ has to deal with
Ugh. Nightmare world.

I've been on E for all of 9 months and I have trouble lifting the fucking garbage bags at my job now. I tried to casually pick up a case of water to hand to someone and nearly fell over. ""Inherent advantage from male puberty"" my ass 🙄
They do indeed say that. The NHL sponsored some all-trans tournament (mixed teams, etc) and the TERFs were out in force whining about how the poor wittle transmascs with no more bone density (like, bitches, you *do* realize being on T fixes that issue?) were up against the big scawy transfems.

It was dumb as shit. (And seriously, why are they always on about the goddamn bone density for transmascs? Do they think cis men don't have any? If not, why are they worried about trans women playing against cis women's superior bones???)
I hadn't heard that. Maybe it depends on the sport? I've haven't heard of mix-gender or trans men in american football, for example. 

But the rhetoric is always ""trans people should play with people of their assigned gender at birth"", so I assumed that includes trans men - except that trans men are forgotten about in these discussions.
If you can’t argue that there is an advantage then the point stands.

Until you can prove there is an advantage then you can’t claim with impunity that there is an advantage. It’s an untested hypothesis that’s being misreport and irrefutable fact.

However, based on the data we have (trans athletes aren’t smashing cis women’s records for example) I stand by the position it’s absolute bs.

Do the research then make the claim. Until then it’s unfounded speculation and anti trans bs.
Thank you!
[removed]
to my knowledge theres been no reported advantage trans women have over cis women in sports. this is just something people, mostly transphobes, have assumed and taken as fact
Ask yourself: why is that?
Nah i think there are a lot of top athlete women that would make it in higher divisions, and thats ok if they are lower it’s like wrestling (i think) where there’s like heavy weight light weight people still watch both just as much
Haven't had a chance to give this a deep dive but at first scan I wouldn't call this study reliable.  She's a competitive runner and therefore has a dog in the fight.  In other words she's biased.  Seems to cherry pick her data to align with her premise that male biological systems cannot be altered by hormone treatment.  She out right states that ""male"" skeletal structure do not change with hormone treatment.  They do.  Bone density changes.  Ligaments change.  Depending how young HT is started there can be changes to bone structure.  She doesn't acknowledge the variance in testosterone levels in AFAB.  She picked the low end of the scale for average testosterone levels.  Many AFAB have much higher levels of testosterone than average.  She doesn't account for age HT was started or if hormone blockers were used early on in puberty.  So, all in all I call it a BS article.  Also, it is a literature review.  Not an actual research case study.
thank you for correcting me!
Yeah it’s always seemed super obvious to me, maybe I’m not fully educated on how it all works but yeah it just seems like there’s so many easy ways to resolve the ‘issues’, I don’t like calling it an issue because it shouldn’t be one.

And yeah it’s always deflection. I can say it is 100% here in the UK, our government have failed our country and are destroying it for profit for them and their friends that own big businesses. Instead of discussing the real issues we constantly have crap about trans people ruining everything or immigrants. 

I just hate that these countries are so obviously lying and hiding things from people and using scapegoats yet people don’t see what’s right in front of them.
That’s true but it wouldn’t have men going up against women, I was talking about those categories within the gendered sports, so still have a woman’s category but split them by weight and height and maybe some other factors I’m not thinking of. Obviously there needs to be a limit so there isn’t hundreds of categories. But even trans women have a disadvantage when competing against cis men.
That may be true but after taking hormones it affects the muscle balance through someone’s body and will affect this greatly. They wouldn’t just let someone compete without starting HRT. I really don’t think the difference after this is done is that great, not like what people would make you believe anyway.
You're absolutely right, but it usually has a negative vibe to it no matter where you go.
Oh no, you committed the unforgivable crime that is, *existing* 😳
You're right! It's one of many, and just so happens to be the most influential as well.
Yeah, vocal chords dont recover from male puberty
Typically calling government ""daddy"" is a very libertarian thing to say because libertarians believe in individual freedom above all, as in most political positions there's a spectrum to things it isn't an all or nothing deal. Then again if you ask some of the most polarized (either end) people you know if government should intervene in such matters you'll probably get a resounding yes and thats because then are either authoritarian or lean authoritarian, there's nothing inherently wrong with having an authoritarian political view even if i personally disagree with it. All has to be taken with a grain of salt, i've been in politics in the past (not US but know it well) and met a lot of people, the only ones i've seen calling daddy government are liberatarians at heart, they oppose general government intervention in most parts of life. That's the whole why i said ""very libertariany position"". Big cheers
Sorry, not going to play that game.  

Just as banning performance enhancing drugs is not about    "" completely dominated a sport "" banning post puberty MF athletes is not either.  It's about an unfair advantage.
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1252764 this is the link to the news article I cited my statistics on, and it provides a link to the organization that conducted the study (British Journal of Sports Medicine).  I’d love for you to “tell me why I’m wrong” so I can simple ignore your reply since you clearly are on one side of the argument, unwilling to adjust your stance in the slightest, despite literal scientific facts given by one of the largest, credible sports medicine journals in the world.
I understand that, but you’re completely missing my point.  A trans woman that has been working out for a year will not be competing with olympians.  So there is no need to worry about any advantage, because she will simply not be anywhere near the same level, and starting that training later in life means that she will also likely never catch up with the women that have been training their entire life.  On the contrary, if a trans woman went through puberty as a man training for the Olympics for their entire life, is good enough to compete in even the men’s Olympics, then transitions and now competes as a woman in the women’s Olympics, this will give her an advantage.  This is because some VERY major development that took place naturally because of testosterone is irreversible.  She will still have those “male” features that provide an advantage, and she will be able to utilize them to outperform the competition.  I am talking about competition, not intramural sports where nobody gives a damn who is playing or how they’re doing.  The Olympics requires a lot more than just skill, just as it requires a lot more than just physiological advantages.  They go hand in hand.  If you don’t have one or the other, you will VERY likely not perform well relative to your competition, who has both.  I do not care if you try out for the Olympics, because unless you were an Olympian previously, you likely wouldn’t qualify whether you transitioned or not.  However, if you WERE an Olympian and you decide to try out for the women’s Olympics, you will excel, because the standard for men’s Olympics is much higher than women’s.  You won’t lose any skill by transitioning, and you won’t lose much of the physiological advantage that you have from before transitioning.  Estrogen on its own will not inhibit your athletic performance so greatly that you will now be equal with cis women.  Mary Gregory is a perfect example.  She was an incredibly strong, successful powerlifter before transitioning, but was not breaking world records.  After transitioning, she broke multiple world records in WOMENS powerlifting, as well as taking home the gold in all 9 power lifting events she competed in.  Lia Thomas is another one.  She swam the 200m freestyle and broke the Ivy League record in her first meet.  She ranked 554th in the mens 200m before transitioning.  It just doesn’t make any sense that the reason these two specific athletes excelled other than a physiological advantage.  It’s not because she grew up with more money or had better access to facilities, it’s because she hit puberty as a male athlete and transitioned after her masculine structure had already developed.  

To reiterate, I am not talking about little intramural leagues or kids co-op, I’m talking about competitive sports such as the NCAA, FIFA, Olympics, probably high school, and whatever other professional league/intermediate league you can think of.  These are athletes that train to excel in their sport, not some Jane doe that’s touched a basketball once in her life and wants to start playing intramural to get better.
The n will ALWAYS be too low, because such a large percentage of the population is cis!  You’ll never be able to take a proper proportion of cis vs trans people, because the trans population is less the 1 percent of the total population (in the US).  However, out of all the credible studies that HAVE been done, none have suggested that there is no advantage to trans woman athletes or no disadvantage to trans man athletes.  Whether or not the “n” is too low, there are no studies to suggest anything different, so how can you just assume that there is no advantage?  When the only credible studies suggest that there IS an athletic advantage to trans woman and there IS an athletic disadvantage to trans men.  To deny credible studies while presenting no credible evidence to support your own claims is absurd and it’s hard to even have this discussion.
Firstly, if evidence supported the idea that transgender people held no advantage nor disadvantage, would you still be making the claim that “n” is not large enough to validate any of the “evidence”?
I believe in this context, evidence is just as concise.  I’ve provided evidence, but your counterargument is that “n” isn’t large enough.  And if the evidence WERE in favor of your argument, you would still be claiming that the “n” is still too small.  However, most of the sources you have are that trans athletes have no advantage nor disadvantage to cis athletes.  A few had said there is “no clear advantage,” but they were all “expert opinions.”  I’m sure these experts have no athletic experience, considering many of them tried to claim that height, bone density, and muscle mass have no real advantage in sports.  In MOST sports, height is an advantage, bone density allows for a larger frame, which again, is an advantage in most sports, and muscle is the sole reason athletes work out.  If muscle mass weren’t a factor in sports, it wouldn’t be so crucial for athletes to build their bodies to conform to the sports they’re playing.  Every single expert had claimed that these have no advantage in sports, but ask any athlete and they’ll tell you different.

Now going off that data, showing that these factors are generally unaffected by HRT in Trans woman athletes, this would provide an advantage, despite your denial of the performance evaluations.
No need to edit.  I’m don’t with this conversation since you can no longer stick to a civilized discussion and refrain from insults on my intelligence.  Research is reading scientific articles from reputable sources and collecting information based on what they give.  That’s what I did, so if you can’t see that then there’s nothing that furthering this discussion will accomplish.
Most people who argue about that don't even care about sports. Most who want to ""protect women's sports"" probably haven't seen more than 5 female matches in all their lives... It's about transphobia where ""trans woman are actually men"" but they don't even care to do the research, only to spread their transphobic views (weather they realize it's transphobic or not)
Sports are inherently unfair to begin with, people tend to be born different (size of body parts, hormone levels). So the integrity is already questionable if the goal is to make a cleanly even playing field.

Note: not disregard the amount of effort training takes and etc. Just pointing out the natural advantages that people are born with have an impact. 💖
Shouldn't it also be about the other kids? If a woman or girl is literally demolishing every single other person and her advantage stems not just from being a talented athlete but from a genetic predisposition to testosterone to the level of men, should all the other women's sports careers suffer for the sake of ""just let them be who they are?""

It is not as simple of a situation as ""just let them play"" unfortunately, though I wish it was.

Imagine being a woman and training all your life and being #1 across the board and then someone comes in with an unfair advantage and demolishes you.
Their post doesn't say leave it to the kid. Their post says leave it to the teams. 

That will absolutely not give every kid a fair chance to be a part of the team they want to be on. Plenty of teams would reject a trans team member from joining unless some policy from higher up said otherwise. 

I'm surprised everyone would want this to be unregulated and that you'd think the average coach and students would be understanding/accommodating of a trans individual, I am not that optimistic.
Yes! I read about it like 3 years ago. My bad
Obviously they are talking about the Italian twin lost at birth

I see what you are trying to say since I’ve seen a lot of people say the same thing, but it isn’t a logical flaw. Sex (along with age and disability) are widely agreed to be worthy of protection. I’m not aware of other advantages that people want to separate. People are simply advocating to continue with the statue quo.

As a reminder, unlike a lot of things, sports leagues aren’t based on gender identity, but actual biological sex. When males were allowed to play, females usually couldn’t beat them, because males are on average stronger in a lot of ways that are beneficial for athletics. Now if it’s just a casual thing, that’s not a big deal, but if it’s a competitive league, leagues will always just pack their team with biological males. So the solution was to make leagues biological males are not allowed to join. [(Except for some sports with set numbers of each sex, and a few where sex doesn’t really matter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_sports). The other league often isn’t a men’s league, but a general league. And high schools absolutely are competitive, so this is relevant to them.

“force a girl to play on boys' teams because she's ‘too masculine’ “ is a bit of a disingenuous way to present it. Assuming they haven’t fully transitioned, it’s *not allowing someone with a biological advantage from testosterone on a team formed so people without that testosterone advantage can win, but they can play in the general league*. It would be great if they could affirm their gender identity in this specific way without being unfair to others, but they can’t (if they haven’t fully transitioned). If everyone in the league is ok with it, then sure, but in a competitive league, that’s usually not the case. 

Not everyone can get everything that makes them happy. What if someone had abusive parents that stopped them from having a normal childhood, including playing in middle school sports. It would make them super happy to be able to go back as a 30 year old and play in the middle school league. Should that be allowed? After all, it would be cruel to deny them from playing in the league that would make them happy.
I dunno what impunity means but yeah
No but for real, nuance is dead in the conversation about Trans people when it comes to Cis people.

Edit: come to think of it, nuance is dead whenever anyone of a minority is discussed by the majority
[removed]
Aren't hormone blockers like, more dangerous for bone health? Also like, literally all the other kids are going through puberty at that stage, and they would be too, just artificially
Is it a ban on participating or is it a ban on participating in ""lower"" leagues when they should be playing in higher leagues?
I did my best to explain that I believe this conversation is nuanced. I never said someone should be banned from a sport simply based on their sex, but I also don’t think someone should be able to compete just because they identify with a certain gender. My point is that biological differences are NOT negligible. You even agreed to my point, that you “could more than likely beat a cis women at a chunk of physical sports”. You agree that your sex has given you an advantage, even with starting treatment at 15. Now I get what your saying, that some people are just a freak of nature born into a rich family so obviously they have a massive advantage, they have unreal genes and tons of resources. But the advantage of male biology persists in every physical and economic cross section of society. I used world records to demonstrate that at the peak level of competition, where the athletes have very similar abilities and resources, there is still a gap between men and women. The argument that biological sex is irrelevant to competition is just wrong. Say it’s bigoted if you will, but centuries of data show a difference.
I worked at raising canes for four months. I started working there in November, and I could lift heavy objects easily with barely any trouble. Started taking hormones in december, and about a month or 2 later, I was struggling to lift things that weren't really heavy.
Agreed. Your original comment (at least the first sentence) made it sound like you were saying there was confirmed to be no advantage
I still think trans women should be able to compete. No solution is without drawbacks, but the way the olympics currently works is the best in my opinion (making sure testosterone has been at typical female levels for a year). No trans women holds any athletic records so it obviously isn't some huge advantage like having testosterone is. I'm sure there are some small residual advantages, but every body is unique and has it's advantages inherently. As long as it's not game breaking I don't think it's much of a problem.
I mean most pro leagues aren't gendered. If there was a woman good enough to be in the NBA, MLB, etc they would already be playing most likely. She certainly would if she was a top player. There have been some women who compete in college baseball though I think. Also, women are on even playing grounds for track, swimming, and stuff like that and there's never been a woman close to the level the top top men are. I don't take any satisfaction from that, but it might be disheartening for some women if there's no womens division.

Edit: I feel like I should say that I support trans women who want to compete with other women. I would want to do the same if I was playing a sport competitively. I just think they should probably be required to have taken HRT like the Olympics requires.
It's easier to accept a comfortable lie than to see difficult truths... It's why scapegoating/whatabout-isms/etc. works:  it asks no change from the people who *could* change things if they just stood up.  Complacency is the name of the political game.  It's why in some ways, it's possible the former US president's election may have been a best case scenario... It shook people awake who weren't before and made them pay attention to politics again.
I think it’s fine, I just think at that point you should also allow biological males to take testosterone to help if they have lower levels. Like if we’re fine with adjusting hormones for the sake of fairness we might as well allow it in general
Yea your not wrong, went into the wrong lesbian subreddit one day and just commenting got me over 100 downvotes within a day
Exactly, and even worse! Being a woman who likes women ;-; those lesbians in that specific subreddit didn’t like that v much
Testosterone on its own is not the most influential.  Over time, testosterone assists in muscle development, bone growth, and many other things.  Many of which are irreversible.  And if you’ve EVER played a sport, you’d realize that skill and size are the most influential factors.  Sometimes being smaller and agile is the advantage, but more often than not, being larger is the advantage, whether it be height, muscles, density, whatever.
Yea tought so, sad :(
How is it okay to say cis women are allowed to be better than other cis women but trans women can’t be better than ANY cis women because it’s an unfair advantage?
Agreed, they want trans to mean an abstract topic they get to judge and rule over. It's about power
This highlight the need for either having everyone compete together, without any segregation by gender or by sex, or create multiple categories depending on individual's physique 

It is already partially done for Paralympics (classification by type and level of disability), as well as in a few sports like wrestling (weight categories). Each high level sport should have categories relevant to the advantage or disadvantage given by specific body characteristics.
not to mention access to facilities, income, class!
Good thing the data says we don't have to worry about this with trans people because after sufficient time on hrt there's no inherent advantage!

BTW where's this energy for every other inequality in sports performance? Should the sports careers of a short person suffer just for the sake of ""let tall people be who they are and play too""? Are you as angry about the huge impact being born into a family with wealth has on a person's ability to train and improve as an athlete? Are you as angry about Michael Phelps having a literal verifiable genetic advantage over everyone he's faced? Or are you only angry about the hypothetical advantage that some trans women could have against some cis women?
So I swam growing up. Afabs are faster till they are 13 on average. Afabs start puberty ealier than amabs so they start developing earlier. If a trans woman has access to puberty blockers and hrt they will have literally no advantage. You can try to argue that they will be taller to wich I say cis tall girls are a thing. When I swam I was 5 10 ish 160 lbs and would compet against 6 4, 200lbs men so that ""issue"" is not trans based.
I'm gonna put this as simply as i can: some people are just better at things. 

Someone can train all their life for something and get demolished by someone who put in half the effort. No one, cis or trans, is immune to this. 

If you can't deal with losing, with being pit against people who are different from you, you shouldn't be doing sports.

Sports aren't fair, have never been fair, and should not be fair.

A cis woman or intersex woman with high testosterone should not be made to take suppressants because her being better hurts other people's feelings. She's just better and should be allowed to win because why is it her career that needs to be sacrificed, why is her career worth less, and why is her effort worth less than anyone elses. 

Everyone comes to the starting line with different advantages. What we decide are unfair ones are entirely arbitrary
What you're describing is an insanely rare situation. Fuck off, I'm done with yours and people like you's rhetoric.
im nonbinary (ftnb) and my school allowed me to play first setter on the men's volleyball team so i guess my optimism comes from experience, but i do see what you're saying.
No? Why should she be kicked off?
So an olympian cis woman who was born with many natural advantages over other women shouldn't be able to compete them either. 

It's nonsensical. If you're concerned with fairness then honestly look at what is fair for an individual. If they are transitioned and fall within the same range of ability as cis women, they should be allowed to compete.

Remember Laurel Hubbard, the weight lifter who qualified for the olympics? Everyone was screeching about how she was going to be smashing records and yet she didn't even place. So I don't see a difference between her and any other woman who has the natural physicsl advantages that help them reach that level. 

There was Lia Thomas the high school swimmer who won an NCAA championship, but what's never mentioned is that she [performed within the same range as her cis counterparts.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/lia-thomas-trans-swimmer-ron-desantis-b2091218.html) She didn't clobber them or smash records, she performed about the same as the previous year's cis championship winner.

And these are top performing trans women, how many trans athletes never rise to even that level? Do you even know?

What it sounds like you're really saying is that unless a trans athlete loses, they have an unfair advantage.

This is exactly what I'm talking about when I talk about people refusing to let go of stereotypes and instead examine the reality in front of them and whether it actually warrants banning trans athletes.
Trans women on HRT don't have an advantage over cis women either
You generally have to be on blockers for hormones to work for mtf. More to the point, there is no consensus in studies that blockers cause bone problems. Several say no, some say they do with certain drugs in a small percentage of the population, but not in general. You also have to allow a certain amount of puberty to happen for the child to ever have sex when they grow up or to have bottom surgery for mtf trans people.

Edit: I should not have said you have to be, that was ftm exclusionary. I do understand there is mono therapy with higher estrogen.
It was much more dangerous with the older forms of estrogen which they no longer use.  Blockers can lead to some bone density loss if they’re on them long term, but ideally after a year or two the child, parents and therapists are confident in the gender dysphoria diagnosis and begin cross sex hormones which don’t carry the same risks.
Ever single drug on the planet has possible side effects. I maintain that transition drugs should always have child, parent, and healthcare provider consent, and should have constant monitoring.

It's the same with certain antidepressants causing an INCREASE in suicidal thoughts. If that happens, the drug should stop because it isn't making things better. Same deal with hormones and hormones blockers. You have to be careful and aware.
They are dangerous with extended use, hence why cis kids don't take them for 10 years.
It's a ban on all, children are being banned from playing sports at school with their peers, it's not just about professional institutions. Most concentrated in K-12, but the bans have been known to include college sports. https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/sports_participation_bans
I can see you've posted another comment but I'm not able to view it so I thought I'd address this also- my sex hasn't given me an advantage. I'm a trans male, I take testosterone, as stated. The fact you somehow correlated ""I started taking testosterone at 15 and am aware I could now slam a rugby game against the average cis woman easy"" as 'this person is biologically male' is a bit concerning for somebody who's trying to project the image of being educated on this subject. My sex is female, I have no trouble keeping up with, or in quite a few incidents, out-lifting my cis male friends- that's because I was able to access treatment when I was, my body was able to achieve parts of male puberty that would be otherwise uncommon, like my bone density and even my shoe size going from a women's 5 to a men's 11. This is why you are not helping the argument, you are not giving anything useful to the debate, you are just continuing to push the narrative that we don't believe sex is real- when in fact we are literally growing hoarse from screaming that we believe sex is real, relevant and so much more complex than a non-athlete especially could ever hope to comprehend.
Again- nobody is arguing that sex is irrelevant. You aren't helping the conversation, you are just continuing to fuel the false outrage in regards to and alienation of trans people. We are telling you to let children play with other children, we are telling you to examine and change the fundamentals of how sports institutions and categorisation works- FOR EVERYONE, so that everyone has a chance to excel, without advantage.
I pull muscles constantly now because my brain tells me I should still be able to lift it no problem. I usually still can lift them, but it takes a bit more preparation and technique to do it properly.
Ultimately the current weight of evidence says there is no advantage. If independent studies come out that prove otherwise then my mind will change as the data does.
Oh yeah i completely agree with there being an HRT requirement for competition and i think a lot of places require 2 years minimum before they’re allowed to compete.  But i still think a division system would work where athletes of a certain sports would test there abilities and get a scoring that places them into a certain division.  No this isn’t like a hierarchy of divisions like the goal isn’t to get to a higher division but just to succeed within your physical ability range.  Yes that might make strength *specific* sports more male based but a lot of agility and dexterity and even certain strength sports i would easily see being a lot of women in the top brackets of all the divisions.  But even in the case of strength sports, like weight lifting or something a women can easily still become top in the division when competing against other people of similar weight and size and muscle mass and whatever other factors would go into placing them in divisions, and no top of one division would be better than the top of another.  Again like wrestlings weight class system.  Like it’s not any more of an achievement to be top of the heavy weight division than it is to be top of the lightweight division.  With a gender system there are *all* shapes and sizes of people within both genders so i honestly think pitting a 90lbs dude against a 170lbs dude, for example, in any sports gonna give one a biological advantage over the other.  Thats kinda my argument against the gender system is having a body run on testosterone might *statistically* cause people to grow more muscle mass but thats not *everyones* case in fact i’d even argue it’s not most peoples case.  So going on purely physical ability and aiming to be top of your ability range would be a better system in my head.  It’s also funny you never heard the transphobic people talk about AFAB men in sports lol or really talk about them in general :/
I mean that’s perfectly fine especially if someone is at a disadvantage because of it, if they can match levels or get them fairly close then there isn’t really an issue.
Fuck them.
Wait, no. DON'T. They'd love that.
...dawg. What?

""Testosterone isn't the most influential sport-related factor in the body, it just affects more things related to sport than anything else""?

You're also pretty plainly wrong - the only irreversible features of androgenic development are bone structure and vocal chord thickness. Everything else has been shown to reverse to within cis-fem levels.

If you've ever played a sport, you'd know that recovery and training time are some of the most important factors in achieving success - those are also the factors most affected by a gender transition that leaves someone with low T.
Voice training is easier for most of us than you'd think tbh
Really?   It isn't a matter of it being ""okay"" or being ""allowed"".  It's a matter of starting off with an unfair advantage.  Coming to this opinion gives me no joy.
>Good thing the data says we don't have to worry about this with trans people because after sufficient time on hrt there's no inherent advantage!

Then I guess the question becomes after how much time is there no inherent advantage? After that time it would be hard to argue that there is an advantage to disqualify them at all.

>BTW where's this energy for every other inequality in sports performance? Should the sports careers of a short person suffer just for the sake of ""let tall people be who they are and play too""?

The distinction is that as a society we have determined where to draw the lines. And yes, some leagues restrict for certain traits rather than by gender. And some by disability. And some by [height](https://thedailytexan.com/2019/01/25/short-students-can-now-play-in-a-league-of-their-own/). 

At risk of comparing women to having a disability, which is NOT my intention, can we have individuals identify as disabled and the compete in the paralympics? We create sectors of competitiveness and draw lines for a reason. 

>Are you as angry about the huge impact being born into a family with wealth has on a person's ability to train and improve as an athlete?

You have me mixed up, friend. I am not angry about any of this. I simply saw the post in /r/all and find the issue to be incredibly nuanced. There seemingly is no one way or even a myriad of ways that are fair to everyone involved. I enjoy trying to discuss and find the best ways in this case. That is the purpose of a discussion forum, no?

>Are you as angry about Michael Phelps having a literal verifiable genetic advantage over everyone he's faced, or are you only angry about the hypothetical advantage some trans women could have against some cis women?

Again, not angry.
>some people are just better at things.

Yeah, they are. And that's why we create leagues and distinctions. 

>If you can't deal with losing, with being pit against people who are different from you, you shouldn't be doing sports.

Aight, no women's leagues then and no paralympics. They can all compete against each other. 1 league. Easy.

The issue is not that some people are better. It is that these leagues have been defined to only include a subset of the population who fits certain criteria. 

>A cis woman or intersex woman with high testosterone should not be made to take suppressants because her being better hurts other people's feelings. She's just better and should be allowed to win because why is it her career that needs to be sacrificed, why is her career worth less, and why is her effort worth less than anyone elses.

Because the definitions and requirements to participate are the league and community's to set. 

If they wanna compete, compete in the open/men's league.

Except they don't want to. Because they lose there. And they think they fall into the definition that permits a person to compete in another category. But perhaps they don't. 

>Everyone comes to the starting line with different advantages. What we decide are unfair ones are entirely arbitrary

What we decide are unfair ones are not arbitrary. They are based on the collective understanding of what the traits of the group permitted to compete are. 

I am 100% fine making every sport have an open league where anyone can compete and then sub leagues for women and para and any other designations that need to be made. Then it's up to the organizers if the person is deemed to have have a certain advantage or not and whether they qualify to participate in the specified sub-leagues.
Puberty Blockers are different from HRT. For a transfemme, HRT is an anti-androgen (to block T) and E. transmasc just take T, which regulates E. You take puberty blockers to not start puberty, so you have more time to figure out your gender, or to stop precocious puberty.
You definitely don’t need to be on blockers for hormones to work
Edit; for FTM not sure about MTF.
Tbh I didn't know that about mtf. Im speaking from a ftm perspective. For a majority of ftm's, we don't have to go on blockers
Interesting to hear. Thanks for your thoughts
Well that's fucked
You know your comment reminded me of that one trans man in Texas, i believe, who was forced to participate with cis women in wrestling and wiped out the competition because he had already started testosterone
Ya know what? Fair enough. Your original post said “let’s talk about that more in depth” and that’s what I thought I was doing. Never was my intention to alienate or discriminate against trans people. I can see how I’m beating a dead horse with centering the conversation around sex. Yes I totally misinterpreted your personal experience and I’ll accept that foot in my mouth. I think we would actually share many similar opinions if not separated by a screen, and my writing ability doesn’t help here. But yeah, the way athletic institutions stand currently, sex is a pretty key factor. But I do think there are absolutely alternatives the the “men’s team/women’s team” structure. What that would look like I’m not totally sure.  I was hoping to begin dialogue but I can see how I went about that the wrong way. Tbh part of the reason I’ll make a post like this is to challenge my own bias/beliefs. Goal achieved, thank you for the insight (genuinely not sarcasm).
Yes but when I just examined sports institutions I’m immediately labeled a bigot. You want things to change but don’t want to actually talk about it. It’s nuanced, it requires multiple perspectives and discussion. I have never put trans people down or said that they shouldn’t be able to compete, but because I don’t wholeheartedly align with your narrative, I’m simply fueling the fire. I hate this new idea that “if you don’t agree with everything we believe then you must be a bigot”. I agree that other systems could work, like rather than men’s and women’s teams it’s all one team with different divisions based on performance. But idk! That’s the point, we gotta talk about shit without being offended to actually come up with solutions.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm lucky I never injured my back with the way I had to lift everything.
Me too. Ultimately there are so many various factors at play that it’s hard to determine a biological difference. And I’m not nearly good enough at biology to determine anything for myself
They wouldn’t, I’m pre-hrt etc so they def wouldn’t love that
Simply taking testosterone does not give you an advantage in sport.  Trans women lose a small amount of muscle mass, but on a professional, or even amateur scale, the difference is negligible.  Average strength in trans women remains more than average strength in cis women.  

I played college basketball, so that pretty much invalidates your last statement.  Testosterone allows men to grow faster than women.  When a trans woman transitions and her body stops releasing so much testosterone, it does not automatically make her as strong as the equivalent cis woman.  Therefore, testosterone is not the main factor.  If it were, the men that produce the most testosterone would almost ALWAYS be better than other men at whatever physical task is at hand.  That’s not the case, because some men are simply born stronger than other men regardless of the amount of testosterone they produce.
Voice training scares me
Why is it an issue now when it was never an issue before republicans started their culture war against trans people?

All of these sports bans are just punishing trans women for daring to be mildly exceptional in public.  It’s just as stupid as saying sports should be split by race.  Oh hey, this also does that because of course these rules apply way more often to women of color than to trans women.
You’re correct about ftm and I didn’t consider what sub I was on. Mono therapy for mtf is a crapshoot and is generally not recommended, especially not in the beginning.
Transfem people don’t need blockers either, they just need an adequate amount of estrogen in their system to cause testosterone production to decrease. Easier to achieve this with injections than pills, though standard care still tends to start with blockers by default.

I’m transfem, never been on blockers, injection monotheraphy and suppressed T-levels straight away.
Well yeah hence the outrage, but sensibility, inclusion and common sense go out of the window when it comes to the topic of trans people or trans children, as always
Oh shit, you'd never guess who I was being forced to change clothes with + play sports with while I was there growing chest hair💀
They want a taste of your forbidden rainbow fruit, & are mad cause they can't have a bite.
Nah, they want some of that, that's why they're grumpy.
There's so much wrong with your comment, wow. Gonna try and go through it bit by bit.

Yes, the act of simply taking testosterone alone doesn't give you a guaranteed advantage. That's why sports have TUEs, to allow folks that need supplemented testosterone to participate competitively. HOWEVER, that's only because TUEs are necessary to get some folks back into competitive levels of testosterone. If T had no bearing on sport, these wouldn't exist. 

It is true that when a trans woman begins transition, they don't immediately fall to cis women levels of muscle mass or strength. Obviously. It takes about three years for things to equalize, which is why most sports organizations have a two-to-three year rule for transitioning athletes. After that period of time, though, contradictory to what you're saying: *muscle mass, fat percentage, grip strength, heart and lung capacity, bone density, and hemoglobin counts all fall to within cis female levels.* At that point in transition, many trans women are going to start to fall behind in competition due to lower testosterone levels compared to cis women causing both increased insulin resistance (shown to also affect muscle mass, fat amount, etc.) and taxed recovery. 

To say ""the difference is negligible"" is just plain scientifically wrong. If that were the case, one would expect the Olympics - an association that's had a rule on transition since 2003 that simply limits testosterone levels and does no diligence on actually checking if athletes compete in their gender categories average range - to be rife with trans competitors. Instead, only one trans woman has ever competed at the Olympics during her transition, and she took home no medals.

While average strength in trans women does remain higher than cis women, this statement is misleading. It's a higher average that still falls entirely within average cis ranges, meaning there are just as many cis women stronger than the average trans woman as there are weaker. We simply fall closer to the middle.

And on your final point, yeah, you're right! Testosterone isn't everything. But it contributes to the most important factors of sport in many fields, especially basketball, and while you're not gonna see top athletes with higher levels of T than anyone, what we *do* see is a higher average level of testosterone present in athletes that do basketball. Across the board.

Hope you're able to consider some of these points rather than continue to stick to the misinformation you've been fed. If you have any questions, let me know.

Edit: final point I wanna tack on here: there's also this assumption that's pretty prevalent that seems to suggest trans women are just cis men before transition, when that's actually not the case. There's evidence that trans women have, on average, less dense bones and skeletal musculature, less muscle mass, and less hemoglobin *before they even start their transition.* Meaning transition will further affect that! 

It's a curious study because they managed to find out some crazy new shit while the body of the research ended up being useless since they underdosed their trans subjects. *But,* it was an alright treatment at the time the study was conducted, so I can't really blame them.

Idk if this will help, but close up your throat muscles a bit and speak from your throught and not your chest or stomach like you normally would. Voice training is 90% muscle memory
Don't get me started on the F-in republicans.  But my position has nothing to do with them.  And just because some assholes use a position I support, to further their agenda, doesn't mean I am going to abandon my position.  

If I knew of a way to reconcile my support for the community and the need to be fair, believe me, I would whole heartly support it.
Yes, I edited my comment and apologize. Some people can mono therapy, although wpath reccomends blockers for mtf. I did make a ftm exclusionary statement, that I didn’t mean to make.
Oof, i feel for you my guy
Oop
Im Just glad most lesbians I know ain’t transphobic
Sadly I’m still single and lonely though🤣
Based
I got no clue how to do any of that
I didn't really care at the time, most of my friends were girls on the team, so i was just happy to be allowed to play- I can't say the same for everyone on my team and I definitely can't say it for people who competed against us lol- but that's the route they're choosing to go, so they can wallow in losing a trans man I guess
Its best with someone to demonstrate"	11yk5su	trans	3811	0.94	2023-03-22 14:06:42
My boss / coworker has a trans daughter, and I absolutely ADORE his enthusiasm about the subject.	"I was working yesterday with this guy - a super kind dude - and he was telling me about his kids.

He explained, ""I got two kids. And, I'm still learning, but one of them is transgender. And she always teaching me stuff. I really support that stuff, I really wanna support my kids.""

So, I looked at him, held up my pride lanyards (one gay flag, one trans flag) and said, ""Well, if you have any questions you can ask me, because I'm trans, too."" Enter in the shock and the 'I had no idea's, as I pass 100%, nowadays.

Then, to my surprise, he started absolutely *gushing* about his daughter to me, showing me pictures, talking about the hormones he's buying her, about how he's always learning, she's always teaching him. Because, as he explained, there were three main reasons he is so adamant about support:

* He used to be very homophobic, as he said he was in a gang and that's just how people thought. He said that's the old him, and the new him ain't like that.
* In the black community, he said it's real dangerous and frowned upon - ""and it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be at all"" he told me - so he wants to make sure his daughters are loved and safe.
* Because he has complete custody over them, alone, he wants them to grow up safe and strong and knowing that they're loved.

It made me want to cry. I kept telling him, ""You're such an amazing parent. You're such a good person."" Since there are so many of us that are alone, or feel alone, especially when it comes to family, I wanted him to understand how much I appreciate what he's doing. This guy just made me *so damn happy.* He cares so *much* about his kids.

Of course, he's trying his best, and he apparently texted his daughter something like, ""I met a transgender at work!"" To which she told him, ""Actually, dad, use transgender PERSON. But awesome!"" Or something like that, you know?

And he was so *excited* to show me his mistake, saying, ""Education is so important. It's so important to keep learning.""

When I told him that I'm happy he supports this trans girl, he asked, ""So when you say 'trans girl' you mean...someone like my daughter?""

I explained, ""It's just like when you have 'boy' and 'girl', only you're tacking on 'trans'. They're still boys and girls."" Right?

He was *elated,* like, ""Oh I get it! See, that's so important to know!""

I adore this man. He's trying his best, of *course* he isn't perfect, but just seeing him trying and wanting to keep his daughters happy and safe gave me fucking *life.* In a world where I always fear trans kids have to grow up alone, knowing this teenager is loved and accepted by her father is the greatest thing.

Anyways...I just really wanted to share this. It was so wholesome.

**EDIT: Aw man, I'm so glad I ain't the only one who was just** ***hype*** **with happiness / near crying at this! Hope everyone is doing okay! <3**"	"this is so wholesome
That's so wholesome It makes me want to cry. I wish the world had more parents like him in it
this made me cry lol
I'm actually crying. Tell this blessed man he gives hope to all the tiny trans people in your phone haha
I really enjoyed reading that, thanks for sharing!
[deleted]
It's awesome to read something so positive, thank you for sharing!
I squealed when reading this post. This is so freaking cute!!
That dad is a Saint! 

I'm so afraid of my environment if I eventually do decide to transition, they will react badly. But maybe I'm the real transphobe...
Lord, this is more wholesome than a quart of fresh milk! 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Thank you for sharing! That was incredible.
This post is turning so many people into waterfalls…this post is so bitter sweet to a lot of us. I hope we all can find someone as encouraging as this father.
This needs to go on r/wholesome and r/mademesmile
That’s so amazing!
Oh I needed to see this today, glad to see there are amazing people out there!
Man, I wish my parents or brother were half as enthusiastic. Anything that's hard or they don't like, they'll just say, ""I'm old"" or ""I love you so you shouldn't be upset,"" instead of trying to learn about the community, our experience, or change behavior when told something it's harmful or phobic. 

Nonetheless,  I'm still happy for her - her father is a blessing and may they stay close 💜🏳️‍🌈
Bless him.
Oh my god this is so cuteeeeeee
What an awesome person, if only everyone could think like him!
Hes a legend and the kind of parent any LGBTQ kid needs
chills and tears welling rn tbh
This is just the most wholesome thing. Thank you for sharing!
This is so wholesome it made me want to cry
My heart is going pitter patter pitter patter and it’s getting really warm in there. We need more parents like this, that are excited to learn more, get educated and more open. Not a lot of parents are like that, most of the time they tend to draw back and be more closed off even if they consider themselves open. In my experience it’s not easy to teach a parent when they live by the idea that “I was born first and am older so I know more than you” or “well it’s not like that back in my day and I never knew about it so I don’t think it’s that great. It’s just a trend anyway and you don’t know who you are.” I appreciate parents like him who are so ready to actually care for their kids and learn from them to make it better for them. Bless his soul and his entire heart and family
This is my motivation for the day. I'm glad there are parents out there like this. It makes me so happy!!!
You've got a great friend! I adore how wholesome this is!
I’m crying on the bus now. This was so lovely
We need more people like this
Damn.

This post made me want a good dad. I didn’t know they existed like this 😢🥺
Can he be my dad? 🥺
I

Am

Crying
Thank you, thank you, thank you for sharing this.
I have not been feeling great and I needed this. Please more of this on this sub.
This is so sweet ahhh Im tearing up omg
What I'd give to have my parents be like this...
I needed this today. My mom chewed me out for forty minutes straight last night about disliking my transition and this was after a half hour of right wing covid propaganda... I'm 23, I'm an adult, I hate that she feels she has the right to do that. So seeing someone actually be a supportive and caring parent for their trans child is refreshing. Thank you for the dopamine hit today. Wishing you and his family the best.
I love that omg what a brilliant dad
Thank you so much for sharing this!!! I’m a ‘new mom’ of a 23 year old daughter and this is making me so so happy. Thank you
i love this sooo much.  i love that he is sooo happy about learning and he cares and wants to make sure he does the right thing.
Hey, who's cutting onions? 😭
I have a coworker similar to this! He's an older white man, and while he doesn't have a trans child, he does get attached to younger coworkers in a really supportive ""fatherly"" way. Two trans people work there, one being me, and he's always trying to research and learn about trans stuff. Always trying to make sure he's referring to us in ways that we're comfortable with, and apologizing for any mistakes, though his mistakes don't hurt as bad because he actually puts genuine effort towards it. He's a serious sweetheart! ♥️
Fuck, now I’m crying
There’s nothing more uplifting than a person telling you they support the trans community before they know you’re a part of it. Because people will obviously tell you how they’re supportive after they know, almost to the point that it can seem insincere.  But your boss realistically didn’t know how you would respond to hearing about his trans daughter and he told you how proud he was of her anyway.  Great guy.
Aww he sounds like a great parent. If he’s on FB, there’s an educational group called “You Might Wanna Learn More About Trans People” that he might benefit from joining. Everyone is welcome there and he can ask questions if he has any and get answers from trans and nonbinary folks with lived experience.
We need more parents these like these
🎼💕🎶❤
Awww 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰

Definitely not crying...
I was really worried about my boss at work, who is an opinionated older white woman (who could easily be a terf, she gives off those kinds of vibes) but when I came out to her she literally said ""that's great! My granddaughter is trans. Do you need any help finding places that stock cute shoes in your size?"" 😍

Enthusiastic trans ally bosses are the best!
All the hugs for this guy!!
I *love* parents like that!

He may not know all the terms yet, he may not know the best way to say things yet, but he’s enthusiastically supportive, and willing to learn and fix his mistakes.

What a wonderful ally and support his daughter has!
omg 🥺🥺🥺 good dad alert 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

this is something I emphasize to any of my cis friends when they ask questions or are confused: it's always okay to grow. if you don't know something, then you just don't know, but as long as you're open to learning and growth then you'll do alright in this world
this is one of the sweetest stories I've read ever ;u;
I love parents who are accepting of thier LGBT+ kids
What a great person!  That's true love and curiosity at its best and made my day!
I'm crying reading this. I have never met this man but I would die to keep him safe. What an absolute gem.
whatever smiling and weeping at the same time is called that’s me
Someone so enthusiastic to learn and grow who cares so much. Oh it makes my heart soar.

His daughter is so, so lucky.
Omg, reading this made me cry. This beautiful person, bending in the wind as he learns, and being so enthusiastic about learning about his daughter’s transition, and walking with her…I want to hug him. I want to hug his neck and tell him that he’s the parent we all deserve. Mine are supportive, but not enthusiastic like this. And for him to cone from the background he came from…he is a truly beautiful person. Thank you for sharing.
My kiddo (13) came out to my wife and me as non-binary recently. While it was a bit of a shock, we are doing everything we can to support them because they’re our child and we love them more than anything in the world. I don’t understand a parent who would do otherwise, it makes no sense at all.

That being said, love you all here and if you need a dumb gen X dad to tell you that you’re wonderful just as you are, I’m here for you.
Holy moly that’s some serious love. We love to see it
Omg I'm in tears that's so adorable and great! I wish every trans*person could have a dad like him <3
I really love this. ❤️
I fucking love this. Give your boss my regards, and tell him this trans girl would love to have him as a father.
Aww that’s so wonderful ❤️ trans kids need parents like that it touches my heart 😭
This is so so so amazing, hearing him so excited to learn and being so proud and excited for his daughter is just amazing! She's one lucky kid and I'm glad he's your boss!!!
“No man is an island entire of itself”, and this man makes the whole so much more wholesome.

I hope this man lives another 50 years at least, because the minute he’s gone it’ll be like an entire continent sank into the sea.
I want to hug this precious man. I'm so happy for his daughter, and his children in general that they have such a good father, and I'm so happy for you that your boss is so amazing.
I'm going to cry this is so wholesome
literally my mum
I wish my dad was this enthusiastic about me being Trans🥺
I absolutely adore hearing about awesome parents like this!
i LOVE the fact that hes so excited to show that he made a mistake and learned from it. most people (especially transphobes) are just too scared of making a mistake, so when they do make one, they pretend that they are right and really just make the situation so much worse. the fact that he is willingly talking about his mistakes and how he evolved from them is just so heartwarming
Dude show him all these lovely responses he got on this post, he gotta know that what he’s doing is not taken for granted and that he’s fucking acing this parenting thing!
I wish I had a Dad like that and not one on the complete opposite end. It woulda helped me transition at a way younger age and/or at least be confident in who I am.
Parents like this really give me hope. Supportive and proud parents of trans kids, you're fighting against the tide and doing amazing.
Hi hornies
ugh
[removed]
wholesomeee
Such wholesome tears running down my face!

His curiosity and love are so beautiful to exist at all, and to have been able to read about and experience it; it is so lovely to know that there are people out there so utterly loved and cared for.

I wish we could have all of such curiosity to withhold judgment about things we do not *yet* understand and the empathy and love to fully take them all in.

May they all have as much happiness as they can hold.
This makes me so incredibly happy. Shit, I'm crying.
Please tell this amazing man, that he's giving many of us so much hope that it's to meet people who are supportive.
my dad couldve really learned something from that guy😭thats so sweet
A late comment but please keep us updated on him if something else happens, I wanna learn about what he learns!!
This is how it should be.
Now you see, it's people like him, he's why we CAN have nice things!

\+1 Faith in Humanity
Well now I’m crying. I wish I had parents like this.
This is so adorable I actually teared up a bit. I would've given anything for a dad like that.
Yo can we clone this guy?
I'm glad he is so big on it.  Even accepting parents can have their negative moments and that sticks with you, so seeing that he's both positive and willing to learn is awesome.  I've had to remind people a time or two that their child/cousin/sibling/whatever is still their child/cousin/sibling/whatever no matter their gender.
This is literally all we want. 99% of days I deal with my mom’s transphobia I say I want to cut her out of my life completely but on the 1%, I’m just so sad and lost and I realize… God I wish my mom would just love me. I wish her love wasn’t so transactional in that I have to be everything she wants me to be for her to smile at me and love me and be there for me. I wish she would help me and support me and realize that I’m just happier this way and be happy for me. It’s so fucking hard, so so so fucking hard to go through it by myself without a parent’s reassurance. Sure, you can have a partner, a best friend, a good support system in spite of all estrangement but sometimes not having a parent support you just hits different…
Lowkey dad of the year... I applaud that he's trying to learn and be more accepting and mature than his former self.
This made my day
If we were all like this man the world would be a better place. I hope he's doing well :]
Meanwhile my parents:

Look, I know you won't get it right 100% of the time right away and that's okay, just put in an effort, okay? That's all I'm asking for.

What? No we can't POSSIBLY do that, this is asking WAY too much, this is all so complicated oh by the way deadname, why do you seem to never talk to us?
Wholesome parent posts really are a bright shining light these days
Protect this man at all costs
I cry every time I hear a story like this. It makes me so happy that fewer and fewer trans kids have to go through what I did.
Awwww this makes me so happy!!🥺 Wish more people were like him!
I wish I had parents like these so I don’t need to continue to hide in fear
He sounds so sweet!
I want to hug him and his daughter🥺🥺
* waves and points to himself* I'm trying to be like him.
It's so wholesome it DID make me cry 😭
Dude, I was getting all teary-eyed in the middle of my shift haha.
same lol made my day
Same here and I seldom cry from positive feelings. This makes me so incredibly happy!
I absolutely *will* tell him! <3
Of course! :D
Right? I'm thinking of telling him, the next time I see him, that I made an anonymous post about him. Show him everyone's comments and stuff. Because I think it may make him happy to know just how *awesome* he is in everyone's eyes, now.
Absolutely, no problem!
No, no, that's a valid fear. I know so many people that are terrified to come out or begin transitioning, even in adulthood and living on their own / away from parents, because the fear of abandonment or being hated by those who supposedly love you just *hurts.* So, you have every right to be afraid, in my opinion.

Hope things get easier for you. <3
Of course! It was absolutely amazing, so I just really wanted to share it with everyone!
Hopefully that's a good ""ugh""? I'm sorry, I hope this didn't upset you. I just really wanted to share some positivity.
I mean, homie, I perused through your posts. I know you're seemingly for right-wing political values. You don't need to disguise your trolling as actual concern, you can come out and say, ""I'm transphobic."" It's totally okay, sweetie.
Same here!!!
You're a great parent then!
Same here same 😂
❤️
And he’s helped a mom too
And you did, to use your words that gave me fucking *life* :D
for them it is a good thing obv

Thank you so much
Can I have a dress like yours mom?

Pretty mommy
Sorry I already have a super supportive mum. Can I have you as my super supportive cool trans aunt who let's me watch 18 rated films at sleepovers even though I'm only 12? 🥺

Thanks mom, I needed that, Dysphoria has been tough on me lately.
I want some love and support. I’m too scared to come out and begin transitioning and I’m worried that I’ll never ever get the chance to be myself.
Thanks mom, your genderfluid woman child here, have a good day mom, and make sure to slayy❤️

This means so much! Thank you, mom!
A lot of us need people like you in our own localities
Thank you, Mother! I really do need something like this in my life!
Thank you 🥺
Thx 😊
Thank you. I needed this. My mom basically just said that as long as i continue to identify as female, I'm not welcome in the home. And goes out of her way to make me stay in contact, all while not respecting my name and pronouns all because ""God didn't make a mistake making [me] a man""
Thanks mom
That dress looks wonderful on you!
❤️💖💝💖❤️❤️
My parents are already very supportive but you do look very pretty!
Super hot🔥 🥵
Aww, thank you trans mom! Your hair is really pretty, by the way. ❤️ I want to get my hair cut soon so I can look more androgynous; your nice post made me feel like I can do it. I'm slowly accumulating encouragement for that step. 😅

So many awesome moms out here tonight. Always perfect timing right when I needed one. 😊
Thank you Mom, love you!

You're way to kind. I just need a shoulder to cry on a person to hug and a person to see Sonya when I don't.
I think you could be my girlfriend
Thank you Mom. I did need that. Particularly tonight. And your daughter says the same to you.
What you also are is smoking HOT!!!!!
Never thought my mom would be so pretty! Thank you🤎
thank you I think I needed to hear that I just didn't know it yet
U kinda do like a fairy godmother or something magical lol 
So cute 💕
Thanks so much much this is really amazing 😘
I suppose I am one in spirit everyone here is valid and deserves the full body autonomy deserves to be validated for their identity so long as they're not hurting anyone willingly so long as they're not truly hurting anyone with intent people take offense but that's not you hurting them that's them deny you your identity as a trans person in spite of themselves so even if they wave the Bible at you always remember that the only thing Jesus ever asked of anybody to receive his grace is merely to have his identity accepted.
Thanks mom, it's nice to have you.
You look like Jenna from 30 rock
Hug, please! ♡
Thank you mom!
🥰😊
...

mommy?
I could use some mom love. Thank you so much. Are you accepting new daughters? I could use someone to talk to every now and then

I accept you. You are loved and cared for. Are you safe? HUGS

I don’t know if you responded to me, but it did look like there was a response if so, would you mind DM me?
You’re perfect and valid, doesn’t matter when you start the journey. The important part is that you made that effort happen. I didn’t start until I got away from my abusive parents as well.
Yes anytime dear!

Yes. I live alone 4.5-5 hours away from my mom but i don't really have friends here and the hardest part for me rn is since i had trouble keeping a job here in Texas, I'm barely getting by for food and stuff. *accepts hug*
Ye I realized that a long time ago and it's pretty sad that this many people's have to live like this.

Anyway, did I say you were pretty?
Thanks! Another supportive parent! Now I have five!

This is a repost, I saw this same image from a different account hours before this was posted, this is also OP’s only interaction on Reddit.         Edit: I was mistaken, sorry
<nods> sooo cute!
Thank you so much, you're so sweet. I'm OPs girlfriend and she's so happy with all the love she's getting 💕
sure, just sent you a message in chat
Maybe, I still don't know and it's been a long journey by her side, we've been together for 8 years and I just know that I love everything about her and especially I love her hearth and her soul ❤️
Repost from where may I ask? She's my girlfriend and she's so happy to finally show herself to the world and get support and love from all this lovely people.

Edit: I saw your apology and I'm very very sorry for being so rude, I'm just very protective of her because she's really happy with all the love and acceptance that she's getting 💕
Awww so romantic

Saying being trans is not a mental illness is now bannable on twitter		"*""free speech free speech free speech""*

&#x200B;

**\*Bans people bringing up the American Medical Association\***
[deleted]
This is just screwed up. Elon has really just got himself in a twist with that like why???
This is what the “pro-free-speech” people really want to happen, and it honestly breaks my mind that more people aren’t calling it out.
Free speech platform huh? Free to be un-checked bigots.
good thing i left yesterday 🙃
And yet spreading disinformation is fine. Lovely.
Gender Dysphoria is NOT, I REPEAT, NOT A MENTAL ILLNESS OR DISORDER!  It is a simple fact of the DSM, and the APA, not a matter of opinion or feelings!  It was recategorized, and renamed specifically to point out that it is a disorder of the body, and NOT of the mind!


See this quote: ""Part of removing stigma is about choosing the right words. Replacing “disorder” with “dysphoria” in the diagnostic label is not only more appropriate and consistent with familiar clinical sexology terminology, it also removes the connotation that the patient is “disordered.” 


Ultimately, the changes regarding gender dysphoria in DSM-5 respect the individuals identified by offering a diagnostic name that is more appropriate to the symptoms and behaviors they experience without jeopardizing their access to effective treatment options.""


From here: https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.psychiatry.org/File%2520Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Gender-Dysphoria.pdf&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjGqfKqprn8AhWMMewKHdEFA0YQFnoECAoQAg&usg=AOvVaw2Ju08u5YUqG84dSCffIwO7



We REALLY need a sticky or a bot to post this!
can twitter finally be marked as anti-trans with shinigami eyes now?
Being active on Twitter is a mental illness 🙃
He's just inviting the trash in.
twitter is a garbage truck crashing into a dumpster fire.
Elons just mad his daughter wont speak to him and his ex wife left him for a trans woman
Why am i not surprised?
alright thats it who wants to move to alaska with me
That’s why I stick to Reddit and hate twitter
its probably the twitter bot reading the tweet and estimating that its hate speech
Man, it’s so wild to see Elon spew shit like this when he has a trans daughter.
Twitter is like a car crash, sad to look at but you can’t take your eyes off it
i want to give benefit of the doubt and say the support team may have misread and not seen the word ""not"" - but i dont really trust the musk rat to have not made it banable soooo
https://twitter.com/AdamantxYves banned?
The only reason why my accourt is still active is so i can witness the website burn down in the first row
Many people in that comment section could heavily benefit from googling the causes of gender dysphoria🙄
I more or less stopped using twitter almost a year ago.

And then the day that Musk's takeover was officially confirmed, I went back on just to delete my account.

I've had no reason to regret either choice.

i was going to say there’s an argument to be made that being transgender, or the gender dysphoria that this usually describes is a mental illness as i had heard words like gender identity disorder and such used by medical professionals BUT turns out the WHO revised their global manual of diagnoses back in 2019 and gender identity disorder is an officially outdated term, it is officially not a mental disorder.

note: the reason i would’ve felt comfortable saying it’s an illness isn’t because i think you can just stop wanting to be a different gender from your agab but because everyone would agree that it’s not a great experience to feel trapped in the wrong body so it can impact daily experience negatively, thus it’s a disorder. i‘ll have to look into the way all that is categorised more but maybe some of you can help me
Twitter is not safe for trans anymore, just like Tiktok never was. Highly recommend you delete your account and the app!
i feel like gender dysphoria is, but idk
Leave twitter. Let it devolve into a conservative echo chamber dumpster fire. Mastodon looks pretty good if you like twitter's style.

I mean it is one though. that doesn’t mean it’s wrong but it definitely is a mental illness
I’m guessing this was the algorithm messing up thinking they were calling trans mental illness.
Twitter is playground of brainless people anyway. Theres only hillbillies and rednecks using it anymore for spreading conspiracy theories.Elon fits there well.

That's really wrong it's not an illness it's who people are
Well, that went in the exact direction I expected it to. Elon is such an asshole.
So tired of Rlon Muskini and his straight up fash fuckery
Being trans is just being who you are. How could that be a mental illness? I suppose gender dysphoria could be considered a mental illness, though, because it causes harm to the afflicted, and transitioning would be the treatment. Calling the dysphoria itself as such can draw attention to the need to address and treat gender dysphoria through supporting transition rather than saying ""you're a girl/boy, deal with it."" Yes, you can transition without having this dysphoria, as being trans is a separate entity from dysphoria; I just feel like labeling being trans as a mental illness is really... how should I say... uninformed and counterproductive. 😑
This is a perfect example of why I just post my youtube video links and move it along when dealing with a company ran by the bigoted moron Elon Musk. I will be spreading a screen shot of this in all my trans grounds in Facebook.
Elon moment
I got banned from that shit hole months ago.
But doesn't that go against free speech? *Hmmmmmmmmm*
This is why I do my utmost to avoid twitter
Jesus Christ. Twitter has gone to shit.
well i guess that's elon for ya
Wtf?
Yea they really love free speech as long as it’s agreeing with them
fuck twitter
Tumblr is honestly better. No Elongated Musk and the culture of the site is honestly better.
I love the silly inside jokes and the weird meme pages :D
Is it me or is the world kinda declaring war on trans people? 😂
Is Elon literally the only moderator left?
Objective: As a CEO/moderatiin team, you don't let your personal life affect your judgement.

Looks like he failed
Elon will rule Twitter, along with its 10 users
I’m feel weird to say that I’m somewhat impressed with how trans positive r/whitepeopletwitter is
Of course, what did you think that will happen once Elon Musk gets Twitter? For real my opinion did a 180 degrees turn.

&#x200B;

Now, let's leave Twitter, and everyone who stays agrees with Elon Musk's bullshit.
Were they banned for that comment or another one?
What was this Muskrat saying about ""free speech""?
The only people who I hear whine about not having ""free speech"" are the ones who are most opposed to others having opinions.

""I want freedom of speech!¡!"" = I want to harm and insult others without repercussion, and anyone who disagrees with me is silencing me
That's fucked up
my peep, ya gotta get off Twitter. Platform is dying and imo it's not worth saving. Not even worth the time of day to fight the transphobes and bigots on the platform. Trust me, you'll be a lot happier once you get off that cesspool.
So, so so hypocritical, free speech but not for us? I""m glad I don't have Twitter, nor TikTok. They're a bit too mad for this girl.
Twitter is the worst for trans and LGBTQ, I don't even have it,
WPATH standards most recently determined that gender dysphoria is a physiological symptom not a mental one. So it’s just accurate to say being trans isn’t a mental illness, simply put
Bannable?
Remember who owns it. We gotta stop being surprised at this point
Stop using the hate speech bird site.

good ol' fashioned freeze peach once again showing it's ugly head. musky must still be mad at grimes
Elon musk why
When you push, they push back. We seen it happen to both sides of every disagreement...haven't we learned this?
This is why I don’t use Twitter.
It's not a mental illness within itself, but all dysphorias are related to some kind of mental illness.
Of course it was Twitter. Yet another reason that shit hole just needs to be shut down. Pre Musk Twitter was already a trash heap and it's just gotten worse.
I've also been banned from Twitter for wondering if the cause of being trans is a metabolic issue and noting that a lot of trans people also have mental illness (which we know is true) then wondering if there's a connection. They claimed it was ""hateful conduct."" I can't see how it's hateful to ponder something that has context and meaning to me. There is far worse on twitter right now that's been there for months. Tweets that are blatantly transphobic and homophobic are still there, but they ban me for simply wondering the origins of being trans which nobody knows.
But isn’t it? You all seem pretty unstable, IMHO.
That's how it should be!
This is making me feel even better about my decision to leave Twitter since Mr. Cringe took over.
Mf’s crazy
Woah woah woah there buddy, we don’t mean THAT kind of free speech. /s
I've literally never had a Twitter account. No Twitter, no Facebook, no snap and no insta.

...I'll stick to youtube, Reddit, Twitch and discord mixed with a few dating apps ever so often. 

Lol, it's been just about 4.5 years and I am a happier girl for it. <3
I think sam Seder has an interesting take on this. If everyone that dislikes Elon left Twitter, it would only be ""centrists"" to far right which wouldn't make a fuss about blatant bigotry. The advertisers only care about the bigotry because the people on Twitter care. If people started leaving, the advertisers would be able to freely go back without a blow to reputation and give Elon the ads he desperately wants.

Not that you should subject yourself to Twitter if you don't want to.
Here's the thing though, while you make a good point to the average casual user, for many people, for better or for worse (worse is the answer), its not so easily done.

Many businesses rely on twitter to effectively market and release information to the public.

Of these companies many are small proprietorships known which are independant lgbtq content creators.

For them, Twitter is instrumental in finding new fans/customers and keeping people posted.

The problem is that they can't just pickup shop and move, because nowhere is ready to accept them with a sustainable enough audience to maintain business.

So really, no one can leave twitter, until there is an already successful twitter, that offers more than twitter including better protections from something like this happening again, and I just don't see it happenings.

So really, the best we can actually hope for is twitter failing in such a fashion where elon makes enough boo boos that hes willing to cut his losses and sell it, to hopefully another billionaire who happens to have better views, because selling it to some nameless corporation would also likely spell bad news for many content creators that while seemingly perfectly fit for western markets, might not be for others in the eyes of the faceless business corp.
Because his wife left him for a trans girl
“pro free speech” mfs when you disagree with them
They don’t want free speech, they just wanna say the n word
I'm pro-free-speech and against this no matter who does it :(
Supplementary info: It was only ever “disorder” because genders have been repressed and oppressed by colonial patriarchy, with a touch of abrahamic religion misquotes. There were always all kinds of genders until the big abrahamic white colonial lot went out on boats to massacre anyone and anything different.

Gender history is fascinating and harrowing. It’s well worth taking the time to learn about if you ever argue vocally about cishet norms being the bs they are :)
Thanks for the link!!
oh it already is at least last i checked it was. and shit the official twitter accounts on twitter have been marked for awhile.

oh it already is at least last i checked it was. and shit the official twitter accounts on Twitter have been marked for awhile.s and even its wiki page apparently are marked anti trans.

Reddit isn’t much better if we’re being quite honest.
Dear God, have you accidently stumbled into a truscum or gender crit sub yet?

Crazy the amount of dishonesty and gaslighting they do.
reddit is full of nazis too
thats a chance sure but most of the time even when it's actual hate speech calling being trans a mental illness the posts never get taken down.
Given elon himself has an enormous hate boner for transgender people, and trans women specifically...

Unlikely. This policy of allowing outright and open bigotry against transgender people was probably one of his explicit requests.
didn't they get rid of the rule that said you can't be transphobic on there? honestly i doubt that's it.
I think it saw “transgender” and “mental illness” in close proximity and made an incorrect (but well-intentioned) assumption about what was really being said.
She hates him.
He has a trans daughter? Didn’t know that
Not all trans people have dysphoria, and even for those who do, it would now only be considered a disorder  (which is not as easily defined than an 'illness') if it negatively affected the person ability to go on with their life.

Even if the general consensus was that it is a mental illness, it still would be extremely troublesome to see dissenting opinions censored on the supposedly free-speech absolutism platform.
Correct! You don't know.
Gender dysphoria is considered a mental condition not a mental illness
It's literally not a mental illness, doesn't fit the diagnostic criteria for one, and the WHO and APA no longer consider it as such. And since i doubt you're mote correct than the majority of the medical community, everyone can safely ignore your opinion.
Being gay was also a mental illness for years. Same with women being upset and getting admitted for hysteria. If you let them label you as a mental illness they will use it against you to the full extent of the law.
You're being inaccurate. Gender Dysphoria you could say \*causes\* mental illness via the psychological distress of living a lie. But being trans is NOT a mental illness.
Im sorry but no. This way of thinking panders to the right and its not gonna work.
It isn’t a mental illness and that’s been proven, it is insulting and not truth
trans ppl🤝neurodiverse ppl, getting fucked over by our normative counterparts for literally no reason.

being neurodiverse is not a bad thing at all. if anything it's something that should be celebrated.

that said, I think the world would do better if being trans was seen as an endocrine issue (""right brain, wrong body"") by the establishment than the other way around. they hate NDs with a fiery passion and want us all wiped out. they have specific prisons that exist solely to detain us, and no one gives a shit. In many states, NDs like me don't even technically have voting rights. similarly, whenever a mass shooting happens, NDs are immediately the scapegoat. If a group can graduate from the DSM and lose their ""mental illness"" classification due to meeting more acceptance in overall society, that's a massive win.

Being a lesbian isn't a sickness. I don't need a cure, I need acceptance, care, and respect. The same goes for my autism, BPD, NVLD, or plurality.
At least you're wrong with some confidence
Seems like it
Yeah, I’ve had Twitter, FB, SC, and IG in the past, but I left them all a few years ago. So much happier.
I do have a Twitter account, but if I get banned it won't be a huge loss (I barely use Twitter, other than for gimmick accounts). I'll just continue using Reddit and Tumblr.
I’m the same way. Only Reddit, YT and Discord
I have a Facebook!

If all those people leave Twitter then why would the advertisers want to be there? The whole point of them being there is to reach people, so if people leave then so will the advertisers.
First of all, even if people who enjoyed Twitter on its own merits left and Twitter was nothing but a sea of bigots, there would still be tons of accounts of people who want to watch and report on all the bigotry, just as there are on Truth Social and Parler and all the other shitholes.

Those accounts would happily tattle to the public that Pampers was buying ad space over pedophile accounts, and so on. People who aren't on Twitter still buy Pampers, and won't like that, so Pampers pulls the ads.

Secondly, leftists _buy shit_. Advertisers that manage to publish ads that are otherwise untainted by association with Nazis, will still not be seen by leftists, who would otherwise _buy their stuff_. If the target audience disappears, the ads are much less valuable than they were before. I'm sure companies selling guns and gay reprogramming camps will be happy about the demographic targetting though.

Leftism abandoning Twitter will not change the economic reality for advertisers one bit.
Advertisers care about bigotry because they don’t want to see their adverts next to repulsive content; it has nothing to do with people leaving the site.  What do you think YouTube’s brand safety systems are about?
Rlly?
One of my biggest pet peeves is when you call someone out for being shitty and say ""it's free speech I can say whatever I want"".

Like, did I stop you from saying that? No? Then you still have free speech. All that grants you is the ability to say what you want, not the ability to deflect people rightfully getting mad at you for what you said.

In other words, you can say whatever you want, but that doesn't mean people can't disagree with it.

He also probably bought out the board of directors so he doesn’t need approval for anything, he just does it
That doesn't explain why so many tweets saying it is a mental illness are still up, just put transgender mental illness into the search bar and see what I mean. There are hundreds of them from weeks and months ago still there. Someone must have reported this tweet for a bot to even look at it where the others were never reported. It also doesn't explain the fact that this is a response to an appeal which you would think a human looks at, but it wouldn't surprise me if they are using bots for the appeals as well, especially given Elon fired all the trust and safety people.
Experiencing gender dysphoria is a disorder/illness where the best course of treatment is transitioning. Being transgender is fine, being dysphoric is not.
im sorry
oh yeah, sorry, english is not my first tongue so i often forget about some words im sorry 😅

There aren't that many progressives compared to ""centrists and the far right"" there would be plenty to advertise too, and it be easier to do so having a more narrow demographic.
Do you think corporations give a shit about being seen next to racism if there is no one to share and criticize that? If the only people seeing it are also racist why would they give a shit? You have too much faith in corporations.

Time and time again, they only care when they get caught and have repercussions.
Grimes dated Chelsea manning, yeah. Technically Elon and grimes weren’t married, but same thing, ya know?
Being able to voice disagreement is a necessary part of free speech. But of course, these types don't really care about that. ""Free speech for me, but not for thee.""
Being a horrible person is using free speech as a weapon and a shield doesn't suddenly make you not a horrible person.

That's what I say to people.
Thanks for asking. I find “gender history” unhelpful as it brings up lots of grammar and etymology. Try “history of trans non binary gender” or something like that. It always differs based on cookies, but one of the first results for me was this, from a massive heritage organisation in the UK: https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/lgbtq-heritage-project/trans-and-gender-nonconforming-histories/

“History of gender nonconformity” works pretty well too. I get a lot of scientific journals and historical organisations come up.

A great resource is Instagram (date I say it!), @alokvmenon is a fantastic creator and if you scroll through to their “book review” type posts, they give informative snapshots and can help with search topics as well as the books being reviewed, as you’ll likely be interested in some aspects more than others. Also Pink Mantaray and Madison Werner have really informative Instagram accounts on politics, ethics and current affairs related to gender. 

I guess add whatever words you’re keen to learn about (e.g. body hair and eugenics are very relevant to the racist history of binary gender; a lot of people are interested in gender nonconformity in the natural world and animals; or any other themes).
ok wierd asf i checked it not long after i made the comment and came back and edited my comment saying edit: just went and looked and its not and it says the site itself cant be marked. but the official accounts and even its wiki page apparently are marked anti trans. a little bit of the end of the edit is still there but somehow most of it go replaced with the original text zero idea how that fucking happned.
Thank you
ohhh makes sense lol
😭❤️
Saying that being dysphroic is not fine is like saying being depressed is not fine. Both things are fine to have. You just need to work on alleviating the issues they cause you to live a fuller life.
Mental health and our understanding/definitions of it evolves rapidly. As of DSM 5, gender dysphoria diagnosis requires that  ""the condition must also be associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.""

DSM isn't used everywhere so, for example, the diagnosis criteria might be slightly different in some European countries which uses different standards.
Oh no worries! That’s completely understandable! :)
You think a tiny group of people getting their rights stripped away are ""cancelling"" the world health organization into changing their diagnostic criteria. That's the absolute craziest thing I've heard. If queers really ran the world, we'd go a lot harder. 

Being trans is not by diagnostic criteria a mental illness. Therefore""literally not a mental illness"" We don't have to try and find something physically in our brains or bodies that causes transness so queerphobes like you can try to physically cut it out of us.
As someone who's all of the above and also depressed, mental illness definitely is a useful concept. It's definitely abused, but it's a useful concept even in an ideal society.
Yeah not gonna lie, I'm having a hard time thinking of a way to phrase what I want to say in a way that isn't incredibly rude or mean so I'm just gonna end the conversation here with stating that I whole heartedly disagree with you.
Technically this is just downright incorrect. Gay couples, both in humanity and in other animal species, often raise the unwanted/abandoned young of heterosexual couples. They do, therefore, have an evolutionary purpose.

However, most of the things humanity both is and does are ‘against biological evolution’. How is it evolutionarily advantageous to keep disabled people alive, since they’re less likely to survive than able-bodied people? How is it evolutionarily advantageous to try and cure diseases, since letting them run their course would only leave those able to survive it to reproduce? How is using condoms evolutionarily advantageous, since it actively hinders reproduction?

The whole ‘being gay is against evolution’ thing is a pointless argument. Humans have kinda moved beyond doing things based on their evolutionary advantages, so this even being brought up is kinda irrelevant.
Being gay is not against biological evolution, it’s a product of biological evolution.
Being in not amazing physical shape (maybe you have a little bit of chub) is also ""against biological evolution,"" but would you consider that a mental illness?

Also, believe it or not, but psychological terms do in fact have definitions. A mental illness is a health condition that causes change in emotions, thinking, or behavior, and causes distress and/or problems functioning. Being gay, by itself, does not cause distress or problems functioning. It does not impact the happiness and wellbeing of the gay person. Mental illness also strongly implies that it should be something to be cured or at the very least treated, and you can't cure or treat gayness. 

As someone who has been diagnosed with depression/anxiety (mental illness), and gender dysphoria (mental disorder), changing your definition of mental illness to suit whatever you think is right with no evidence to back it up is doing absolutely nobody any good and makes no sense
what do you mean i cant call anything i want a mental illness? it is just my opinion.

...lmao
DSM-5 is not up to date. Check ICD-11 by the WHO where it is not listed as a mental illness, but a bodily issue related to sexual health. HA60 & HA61 for gender incongruence in adults and children.
Gender dysphoria is not the definition of being trans. Two different things
I am a sex-repulsed ace, and aroflux, so I have varying levels of romantic attraction. I am only romantically attracted to women, so I am a lesbian.
I suppose different advertisers care about different demographics. For example, maybe the sneaker companies care more about the progressive demographic (at least along some dimensions), while the hobby supply companies may care more about the conservatives. But even the centrists care about the nazis. And Twitter was already in trouble before they started losing users — even before Elon got Twitter to pick up that massive debt so he could buy it. Losing net users is bad, whatever the demographic, because some paying advertisers are trying to reach that group. That’s why the old Twitter worked so hard to keep everyone on, other than the groups that caused others to leave.
To put it simply:

advertisers post in a way that implies endorsement (for instance in a right wing video or site) -> that somehow gets to a journalist, it always will -> an article is written -> brand is damaged 

Even if no journalist sees it, a customer probably will somewhere, which still causes damage. Alternatively (and more dangerously), employees may see it; companies *need* diverse talent to succeed.

It’s unsafe and too dangerous to do, even if it’s a site only used by right wing trolls.

If they personally care about racism etc. or not is irrelevant, advertising around it will almost always cause issues, which means they don’t.
Huh, I didn't know that. Interesting
no problem, happy to help!
Yeah, I think it depends on what we mean by “not fine”. 

Being dysphoric (or depressed) is not something to be ashamed of, it doesn’t represent a moral failing, and it doesn’t mean you’ve failed in any other way, either. Those are the things that I typically jump to when someone says something is not fine (though that may just be the conservative Christian conditioning). 

But if by “not fine” we mean that anyone with dysphoria (or depression) deserves better, and should be able to pursue the course of action that will help to alleviate those issues, then yes, 100%.

Humans are dope! I can relate in the opposite way bc im a straight woman.... who is also trans.
yeah i was thinking you were gonna be ace or aroflux thats cool.
Also because his trans daughter disowned him.
DSM-5 is not in use in many countries, mine included, and even in countries where it is used it is widely accepted in the scientific community that gender incongruence/being trans is not a mental illness. This is the case in the United States where DSM-5 is used. So there's no true debate on whether it is a mental illness or not, that debate is already settled and it's not a mental illness. The problem is simply outdated and factually wrong classifications. It's an outdated classification issue, and considering how long it takes to make new DSMs that wrong classification will be around for a while, but the experts that even use DSM-5 knows it is a false classification and that gender incongruence is not a mental illness
Not every trans person experiences dysphoria. Not every trans person wants to medically transition. The idea that one needs a medical diagnosis to tell them they are allowed to be trans is transmedicalist gatekeeping bs
Gender dysphoria is the distress caused by a disconnect between sex, and gender. Being trans is having a gender that does not correspond to sex assigned at birth. You could cure dysphoria by transitioning, and still be trans.
I’m trans/nb/Agender/xenogender, and I don’t rlly have gender dysphoria.

ok

> **It is important to note that gender nonconformity is not in itself a mental disorder.** The critical element of gender dysphoria is the presence of clinically significant distress associated with the condition.

https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Gender-Dysphoria.pdf
Here’s an in-depth explanation from the American Psychiatric Association.

https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria

TLDR: not all transgender people experience gender dysphoria.

The diagnosis in the DSM-5 was created to help people with gender dysphoria get access to necessary health care, and treatment. The term focuses on discomfort as the problem, rather than identity.

While many countries require a diagnosis of gender dysphoria for various treatments not all do. As a Canadian I didn’t need a diagnosis to access HRT."	106v38o	trans	3465	0.97	2023-01-08 21:37:17
Can we get some support for transmascs in the chat? Roe directly impacts them and I see a lot of erasure on mainstream Reddit.	"Abortion is not just a “women’s issue” and you aren’t any less a man for having a uterus. I’m sorry that people are being so stupid about this. I’ll be fighting for your rights and the rights of everyone who can get pregnant in the streets. 

-an angry trans girl"	"Anyone that can have children should have the right to choose for them selfs and politics need to stay out of it PERIOD.!
My heart goes out to all my bros and non binary mascs 🏳️‍⚧️🤟🏻🤬
Thank you.
Keep supporting each other over there in the states. I wish y‘all luck to get this issue fixed!  

Also, this post contained some info [how to access abortion pills](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/uhl3ia/athome_abortion_guide_where_to_order_pills_online/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).
I saw a particular infuriating Tumblr post claiming that the tiny proportion of people saying 'pregnant people' rather than 'women' set the groundwork for this by apparently taking misogyny out of the equation. Talk about infighting and forgetting who the *real* enemy is...

My heart goes out to all women, trans men and AFAB non binary people who just had vital bodily autonomy rights stripped away from them.
Thank you, angry trans girl
Thank you. Seriously, this means a lot
Anyone who can get pregnant should be protesting anti abortion laws.  It's ridiculous that they're letting religion overwrite constitutional rights again.

Edited to clarify that by ""religion"" I mean white Christians.
##WHO WANTS TO START A REVOLUTION!!!!
Thank you so much, as a trans masc we often get forgotten when it comes to afab reproductive rights
Hell yeah!
It affects everyone! Not just women, men, cis, trans, everyone. Your legal right to privacy will be revoked if this goes through.
I saw a good amount of transmasc erasure on Twitter as well but thankfully I keep seeing people speak up and keep our brothers in the conversation.
Politics should run a country. NOT OUR RIGHTS TO BE US. Who's life is it anyway? Live it your way in spite of them. Another angry trans girl.
And therefore, anti-choicers are simultaneously misandrists and misogynists.
If you think about it, the government is switching from protecting the rights of AFABs, to protecting the rights of the government to use them as surrogates. Gross. In effect, the government acquires ownership of anyone once their body contains a fertilized egg. 


**Optional story time!**:

I live with a staunch conservative who, shit you not, deadass believes that this is something that the Dems have been fighting to overturn. I quote, “the Dems are loving this! that godless socialist Bernie Sanders is having a hay day!” 

Remarkably, he himself believes in womens rights / choice and Im generally polite and gentle in redirecting him about other right-wing nonsense (albeit in vein), but I couldnt not laugh in his face… even when the head of the Dems was on TV saying “we will fight for the rights of women to have choice over their bodies” he said “see? see!?” ..He expressed genuine confusion of how this one ahem is slipping through the cracks since conservatives have the majority of the Supreme Court now. Its honestly beyond him that that is the *exact* reason why this is happening. 

So, my angle with him is so far, “ok so you say that this is a Dem thing and that the Repubs want to keep Roe v Wade and the Dems want it overturned?” (Yes). “Ok, 35 states have it within their laws that if this gets overturned that their abortion laws will reset to pre-Roe v Wade, most of which are red states, and many of these would be a total ban. THAT said, when this gets overturned, since Repubs want to keep these rights in place, do you anticipate that those red states will instead keep the current abortion laws and protections in place?” (Yes) “………….well thats reassuring. I guess we will know for sure when it is officially overturned, and see what those states end up deciding.” 

….. so. This guy is in for a rude awakening, however, I am quite certain that when the reality of this smacks him in the face he will believe that its a Dem conspiracy. Unfortunately. Interestingly, right wing news that I have had to hear thus far is redirecting all of the attention about this issue towards the leak itself, and the immortality of breaking this sacred code of the confidential materials of the Supreme Court. They seem to be “playing it safe” on the content of the issue, which is a bit surprising and at the same time not. The look-over-here tactic is their go-to afterall.
Thank you for this post, OP. I’ve (NB, TM) been depressed and spiraling all day so your support is so appreciated.
Speaking as a trans woman I support your call for action as a trans man. Often too many trans women wilt when the need to take a strong lobbying position because, I suspect, they feel they're not being dainty enough or internalised gatekeeping is getting to them. I'm sure similar for different reasons might apply to trans men scared off from taking a stand on abortion. The way I see it is the more support from as many and varied people as possible the better!

The undoing of Roe versus Wade is important not just within the domestic US but internationally too. The UK, or Terf Island to some, has been used as a launchpad for transphobic action in the US and mainland Europe too. It's all connected.

I think some US politicians have been very good with throwing punches back at the extremists. Elizabeth Warren's statement today was very powerful. In the UK the odd woman such as the politician Emily Thornbury stood her ground when standing up for trans women. They and other cis people of good faith show what can be done.
I am a trans man and I’m consistently harassed for taking bc because I “don’t need it if I’m a real man”
I’m here, I’m queer, and I’m trans, ya hear?
This is what I've been saying! This affects basically EVERYONE, and we need to stand by not only our cisters but our FtM brothers and sibbies, too!!
The thing is it isn’t just about abortion. It’s about basically all bodily autonomy regarding reproductive organs that are uteruses and ovaries. 

This includes birth control. Something that many many people need for MEDICAL reasons. This will make getting access to these things harder.
Anyone with a womb should have the right to choose what happens with that womb. 

On a separate issue but one that I feel is relevant, we really do need:

1. better contraception options for those with testes
2. the right for the non-carrying parent to have a ""legal"" abortion (as in, to legally sever rights and responsibilities towards a child) up to a week or two before the deadline for the carrying-parent to have an abortion.

The whole system is crap at the moment, no one is doing well out of it.
Yeah I don’t exactly understand what the Roe thing is, but from what I can tell it is completely and totally shit.
Is there a way to sign up to help?  Like I can drive people around if I need too?
To anyone who’s impacted by this scary bullshit, I’m sorry, please be safe!!

- an angry trans guy
I wish I was American so I could support fellow transmascs and all other people. I am very furious that there is a draft to overturn Roe vs Wade. That is such a disgrace. As a Filipino transfem, I support our trans men!
there should be no gendered care.

care should be individualized by your primary health care provider.

Anything in the way of that should be scrutinized.
Transmasc NBy - I'm making an appointment to get sterilized ASAP (I've never wanted to have children, but now it feels like I need to do this, just to be safe). Every step of the way scrambling to get ready to have human rights revoked in a state with a trigger law, it's **WOMEN'S HEALTH**. It's only been a day but I'm emotionally drained and numb. 

  
My biggest personal fear right now is that I only JUST recently was finally able to get started on oral contraceptives in order to treat PCOS - so if they overturn Griswold, I have no idea if I'll be able to continue my treatment in the long run, and it's back to constantly stressing over the negative health impacts and things like cancer risk.   


I don't most people realize that prior to ruling it unconstitutional to legislate against people using birth control, CONDOMS were included - they were sold under ambiguous names like 'rubber goods,' like how bongs get labeled 'water pipes for tobacco use only.' Are we gonna go back to euphemisms and making possession of even non-medication protection a crime again? I know that the GQP would *love* to have a surge in desperate, impoverished, generationally traumatized wage slaves and soldiers to die in wars defending stockholder profits within the next 18 years, but are we also trying to breed up a new STI epidemic?

I cannot imagine that even among conservatives that are gleeful about rolling back reproductive rights that there's enough popular support for the idea of a total ban on contraception - even the LOUDEST Trump-is-still-the-president idiot I know isn't enthused to have an unplanned kid if he can take some precautions (though apparently he's just peachy with the idea of just accepting it if he knocks up his girlfriend and introduces a child to an environment where they're regularly wasted, physically violent with each other, and screaming and destroying things so loudly that the police regularly get called on them) so anyone with the barest level of awareness realizes it would hurt them just as much to lose legal access to contraception.   


...But I'm also scared that I'm overestimating the awareness and foresight of a large portion of the population.   


Are people going to have to fuckin... I dunno, 3D print molds for reusable silicone sheathes or something? WTF is this timeline, everything is so fucked.
Sometimes I wish punching the ones responsible for this shit was legal.
I’m glad someone did this
Thank you guys! Nice to see some love and support 😊
Thank you.
thank u for this! this whole situation has left me terrified and the support helps much more than u may think 💖
? i see plenty of transmasc stuff. idk what you're talking about.
Good reason for using TOR browser.
Bump!
[removed]
thanks for this. roe affects anyone who cares about anyone with a uterus, and that should be everyone
If politicians stopped interfering with lives of people they'll never meet, they'd be out of a job
Pun intended?
Terrifying that we may have to resort to this but I'm glad the info is available
Seriously? What about the TERF groups who allied with right wing groups against trans people... Same right wing groups who oppose abortion rights... Will the same TERFs be upset about this threat to abortion rights? OR maybe they were never really feminists in the first place?
That is almost surely either an op or someone who has no idea what’s going on.
No problem! ❤️✊
As a religious transmasc, I agree. Life is important but I'm pretty sure if I ever get pregnant I would have complications. These people aren't thinking about how this will affect people who can't safely support a baby. What if someone can't get an abortion and then both them and the baby dies due to them having complications? What then? And even if there are no complications, forcing someone who doesn't want a kid to have a kid won't be good for the child. And some people aren't financially stable enough to have kids, so then the child would grow up poor. Bringing someone into this world only for them to have a bad life is more cruel than aborting them.

Honestly, some religious people are so brainless.
And apparently in Judaism it’s said that a pregnant person’s life comes before the fetus, meaning if an abortion is needed then it should happen. So technically anti-abortion laws are impeding on religion and religious practices.
ME
Many are saying this!
Correct! This is a massive threat to the civil liberties of every American.
What the fuck? How on earth can you think republicans are protecting abortion rights? What is happening to these people.
Wow, that was a difficult read despite your expertise in articulating the thought process of another person. You are a lot more empathetic towards another person's feelings to put that much personal time and effort to play such a game.  The majority of left progressive/liberal democrats view anything republican as ,""Those rightwing conservative Republicans are inconsiderate, ignorant, uneducated, close minded, and full of hatred( fill in the blanks)"".

... the civil rights and LGBT movements have been *lead* by trans women and other trans folks. Not sure where you got the idea we ""wilt"" when we need to take a stand. Trans women of colour have got to be one of the most politically active and effective groups in history.

Stonewall was a (trans) riot.
Maybe some do but many of the loudest activists for abortion and lgbt rights are trans women. I hope I can live up to what my older trans sisters have done!
Nah, screw them, keep taking that BC my dude. They're probably the same people that believe ""real men"" don't wipe their butts and other toxic masculinity stuff, lol
Oh it’s about even more than that. Roe is the precedent for federal right to privacy. It’s the foundation of countless modern civil liberties. Everyone’s rights are at stake.
Roe vs Wade was an amendment to the constitution that said people have a right to abortion.  So basically they're taking away the amendment, a constitutional right.

https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113

That's the full thing.
Do you mean to get abortions? I would contact your local planned parenthood or reproductive rights organization and tell them you’re interested in escorting people.
Anywhere that’s not specifically trans is referring to it that way. Someone in my school sub even made a joke at transmacs’ expense about it

I am glad to see it’s mentioned here at least
/r/politics calling it a “women’s issue.” Idk. It might just be my feed but I’ve seen this on other socials as well and I want to make sure transmascs aren’t forgotten right now.
Lol
It‘s been deleted :-/
I agree feminism isn't just about fighting for women it's about fighting for equality among all genders. If you can't do that then you have no right to call yourself a feminist, they are just trans exclusionarys.
They were never feminists. They’re far right weirdos who don’t have any presence outside of their online echo chambers. And of course, none of them are fighting to protect Roe.
This. Yes. 

The Satanic Temple is also using this as a reason to fight anti abortion law too. 

 I edited my original comment because I meant white Christians when I said ""religion"".  But these people are so egotistical that they think their religion is the only way.   It's ridiculous to weaponize religion and use it as a form of control.
😂 Right?! I was dumbfounded. The some serious delusional shit. Im still having a hard time believing it. Ive pulled him around with a few things subtly… I *really* hope this wakes him up. Not going to put a wager on it though.
Thanks 🥹
Yup
I haaate to be annoying here but it’s technically not an amendment, but a judicial precedent.
Thanks!
oh! sorry thought you meant here 😅

Is this message in response to trans hate offensive or supportive?		"the biologist is supportive of trans folks. and he's slagging on phobes trying to use ""science"" to prove their bigotry... when biological science directly and repeatedly debunks anti-trans rhetoric.
It systematically destroys the original XX/XY ""sexual species"" argument, so I'd say it is supportive. Nor that conservatives believe in science, so limited use in the broader sense. It's just saying that even your DNA is not a reliable metric for determining sex, and gender.
I like that comment, it gets an upvote from me. I find it supportive. It shows very clearly that gender (as well as sex) is everything but binary, and that being trans isn't just ""some made up bullshit"" or whatever bigots think, but an actual thing that doesn't have anything to do with religious beliefs (or lack thereof), politics, or whatever they pull out of their arses.
The purpose is to state that biological sex is much more complicated than the XX/XY stuff we were taught in 8th grade destroys the biological sex argument from transphobes so it is generally supportive. Forrest Vallaki on YT has a video that is basically this statement titled Sex and Sensibility

(The one in the original post, not Xx= girl xy= boy)
This is the tldr for ""basic biology is cool, but have you taken an advanced course?""
Why would this be offensive? It’s accurate biology
This is very supportive! I say this shit myself just not as eloquently
He's supportive, even if he talks a little complicated :)
Supportive.  

Not that transphobes really care about science, but we can and should demolish their bad science.
this is one of those ""okay, I'll make my argument on your terms and still be right"" kind of posts. I love these. My religion growing up centers on agency so whenever they try to argue that they should vote their religious beliefs into law I can just say ""hey your religion is founded on agency and the belief that Satan's plan was forcing people to live ""correctly"" and Jesus' was allowing choices even if they're wrong so you're going against your own god with that mindset"" and it works every time. Bigots are almost always wrong even from their own definitions.
I like this
Supportive obviously
Wonderful! I love that text!
yeah the tldr is that gender aside, sex is not even the binary it is made out to be.
It is affirming and supportive.  Male vs female is not as cut and dry scientifically as many people think.
Very supportive. Science DOES defend us, it doesn’t deny us. Simplifications of complex processes to support a narrow worldview is what hurts us. This science teacher gets it
It’s supportive of trans people. Basically saying that in reality, biology is much more complicated than transphobes would like you to believe. It’s almost like it’s an entire field of science that people are still studying and changing because we don’t know everything about biology (and probably never will).
supportive, essentially they are saying “chromosomes do not mean as much as you think they do”
pro trans scientist spitting absolutely biologically accurate Facts 👌
this made me think of a joke

What does your DNA say when it forgets to give you a gene that gives you a feminine body?

Sry
The ONLY thing I have an issue with is bringing up the behavior of bluegills, and cuttlefish. Since transphobes often say that transwomen are just predators who ""pretend"" to be women as a means to get close enough to...yanno. 

It just feels like smth a TERF would latch onto as a means of reinforcing their fucked up beliefs. It's defo pro trans tho.
very obviously supportive. the last two sentences are ""Don't use science to justify your bigotry. The world is way too weird for that shit""
I honestly see this as an ABSOLUTE and unrefutable ally for trans people
Based science teacher taking the piss out of a transphobe for their obvious ignorance of biology
It’s evidence that transphobes can understand to support “sex is determined by more than XX or XY.” The intent is to debunk transphobic arguments, not to make any claims about what trans people are or aren’t. I don’t see it as offensive at all. I also haven’t seen it work (I hope it does anyway) and it’s a very bio 101 take, but most transphobes are stuck at middle school biology, so… step up? Basically, there’s more work to do to understand trans issues than just that, but if that can convince anyone to start down that path, it’s done good, and it certainly doesn’t do any harm, so I don’t think it’s worth fussing over.
I found this, didn’t type it myself. I’m queer, but not trans. I thought it was really cool and grounding for people who only see 2 black and white cis genders, but there was an offended comment about being compared to fish like fish are below us. I don’t see any animals as higher or lower than others, just different species, including us, so maybe my vision is impaired here. I don’t want to try and stand up against the whole “trans men aren’t men/women aren’t women” if I’m actually offending trans people.
the last sentence is my favorite. The transphobes are the same folks who see humanity as a big declining pile of waste, ruled by our animal instincts. We are, and can be, so much more than mere animals. It is a moral responsibility some are too afraid to face. We are wonderful beings with special gifts. It is tragic. It’s a dehumanization across the board. Hence misogyny = transmisogyny = racism = misogynoir = all the rest. At the end of the day you either humanize yourself and others, or dehumanize.
They got the gender of clownfish wrong, they're born male and transition to female as they age
It kinda goes back and forth in the beginning but the end part kinda suggests pro trans, idk I think they're speaking less on the general concept of trans men are men and trans women are women and more of focusing their argument on disassembling people's uneducated arguments against transitioning to begin with.
Im pretty sure this is an old post because i l've seen it or at least seen something extremely similar years ago. This is for arguing with people who are sort of centrist on the matter and care more about science than respecting fellow human beings. If they want to talk about biology, then biology shows that black and white two genders is made up. Anyone being offended about being compared to fish needs to realize that when biology is whats being argued, feelings dont matter. Which is a funny thing to say considering transphobes love to parrot ""feelings dont matter"" without understanding science.
This definitely seems to me to be supportive. The teacher is calling out transphobes that attempt to use biology to further their own bigotry, and they quite effectively blew up the whole thing. If it's anything other than supportive, I don't see it, admittedly.
What an awesome response
This is absolutely supportive (at least from my perspective) They’ve basically just destroyed “science doesn’t support trans folks”
100 percent supportive. Debunking every ""science says"" anti trans argument one after another
saving this for later lol
“male reptiles develop in cold environments”

maybe im a reptile
Supportive, the universe is not binary, never was, never will be. Only haters have a one-dimensional view they want to force on everyone.

Now I am going to go look up the thousand sexes of slime molds.
It’s supportive
They’re debunking the chromosome argument with actual genetics
Uh… pretty straightforwardly supportive.
definitely supportive!
Sounds supportive to me. The science teacher’s final line drove it home for me
I love this teacher
It was literally someone like this that helped me realize I'm trans (Forest Valkai - specifically his video ""sex and sensibility"" it's got the same ""biology is NOT SIMPLE"" and ""being trans is 100% biologically supported"" feel to it). So yeah, I LOVE when science is used to just trounce transphobia!
based science teacher
Yeah def supportive. That last example was meant to be us I'm pretty sure, all the rest was just completely dunking on the 'phobes on how inane it is to use science as their argument like that
To answer the question: Is the message in response to trans hate offensive or supportive?

Supportive of trans people
It’s supportive. It’s destroys the argument that the X and Y chromosomes are the only way to identify sexes.
Jesus Christ thanks for saying it. This is most of my rants damn near exactly
Thank you, doctor.
Very supportive in my book. At the very end they clearly mention trans people in a supportive way and they very effectively debunk the transphobe's arguments. (to anyone who cares to read it)
This is amazing
I am a trans christian, not only do I say it's absolutely supportive, but it makes for some FINE ammunition lol. I knew about a tiny bit of this already but the rest is blowing my mind lol.
Omfg I needed This
Even in humans sex chromosomes arent all XX/XY. People can have XXY, YY, XXX, ect. assortments of sex chromosomes. Its science.
That’s an amazing response, & definitely supportive! We should all memorize this so we can recite it at the phobes until thier eyes glaze over & they pass out from cognitive dissonance.
This is great.    The problem is the 'phobes like to say ""Trust the science...BaSiC bIoLoGy...TwOoOoOoO GENDERS, GaWd....""  They don't care about advanced science; they don't trust educated people or intamallectuals.  It sure seems like they are just proud of being stupid.

I don't want to be completely negative though.  I really like posts like this because they help me when I sink into imposter syndrome or my internalized transphobia. I can't be the only one.
extremely supportive. they're just pointed out the ""biological and scientific"" variance that exists in nature.
I learned this crap back in 5th grade science class
why would it be offensive??
Like it’s science so I don’t think it’s offensive. I think the point is, humans are more complex than XY XX… science justifies trans people even if it’s more diverse than what they’ve said.
This is good
This is the advanced and in depth version of what I tell people when I have the energy to engage.
I vote supportive.
Supportive, I know that the talk about a female body can sound inherently transphobic but this was aimed at transphobes, so using inclusive language would just make them disregard the post and probably not even understand it
I'd say this post is very supportive.
Like looking in a mirror for me. Nothing is more satisfying or empowering then putting someone in their place by displaying overwhelming intellectual dominance.
He’s 100% for trans people here and against transphobia, he’s saying chromosomes do not determine your gender at all and have an effect on the sec your born as but you might have certain mutations that muddy the water on which sex you are and so saying makes and females only have certain chromosomes is a bold face lie because it’s simply not that simple
I want ""don't use science to justify your bigotry, the world is way too weird for that shit"" on a t-shirt.
It’s the objective truth about biology when it comes to trans’ing your gender.
I'm adoring this whole post and will defenetly respond with it to anyone who wants to TRY TO use science to back up their bullshit
This biologist just crushed years of transphobic arguments in just 1 long text. I love it :)
Damn the way that hit straight up distortion finished that phobe fr.
why would it be offensive??
Supportive very much especialy at the end :)
absolute supportive
Well, look at the last 4 sentences, what do you think? /nm
Definitely supportive. The ~~second~~ fourth to last sentence.
Yes!!!!!
People will take one biology class in high school and think they know it all. We really need to update textbooks on this shit so that people don’t get the wrong ideas
Supportive, especially the very last bit! 🥰🥰🥰💖💖💖
Flatworms? That's awesome.
I wouldn't go over to other species frankly, never take the bait from reactionaries and never address issues on their terms.  


Ben Shapiro loves to say ""facts don't care about your feelings!"" because he doesn't know what either is. The feeling of thirst is as real to a person as anything that you can touch, and yet nobody else but him can perceive if his body is asking for water.  
When I feel I am a woman, it is a self-perception of myself akin to all the other ""feelings"" I have!
100% supportive. Reading this was so heartwarming
This person is awesome
They're being supportive. They're basically explaining how the ""BeInG tRaNs GoEs AgAiNsT sCiEnCe"" is bullshit, because not even our birth sex can be explained with simply saying ""xx chromosomes mean female, xy chromosomes mean male"", and because maybe not being trans itself, but ""changing one's gender"" (for a lack of better words) can be found in the animal kingdom aswell.
Honestly you are my hero for commenting this xD
Hero
Its the bigots calling it ""basic biology"" for me. Like the existence of basic biology must mean there is also advanced biology. I mean, were we expecting these bigots to be smart in the first place?
I take this as very supportive and a successful attempt to debunk every trope rolled out by transphobes trying to hide their bigotry behind ""science"" rather than just owning up to the fact that they are bigoted. The post covers a lot of different scenarios, and it grounds it in biology. It includes the difference between our thoughts, brains and bodies and how these can be out of sync and in conflict with each other. But most bigots will just ignore it, and some will play mental gymnastics to convince themselves they've debunked it. But I take it as strong and objective support.
I kind of want to save this. Don’t get me wrong, it’s got issues, but it still made my day.
I can’t explain it but this gave me a lot of validation…🥹 happy trans noises
As already said, it’s supportive. My flatmate, who studies genetics and experimental biology was taught the same stuff as mentioned in this message. I can clearly say that it’s very much accurate. Biology is a very dynamic science, I’d say. It only proves that we’re much more complicated than bigots think.

Side note that I really wanna take this message, translate it into my native language and shove it into my intolerant mother’s face.
Biology is science. The only thing that matters is how you feel.  I’m 55 and regret that I never gave in to my feelings, I  was born male and had to be a male because there was no other choice for me. But I am unhappy in my life because I never came out that was a woman,  even now I'm afraid to say it out loud because I don't want to lose my wife and family,  so don't come to that point i’m  at.  Fuck science and go for happiness 💋💕
Bro literally ate and left no crumbs
Gonna print and have this on me at all times 🥰😌
I find it supportive as someone who’s gender has absolutely nothing to do with my sex
This is one of the most supportive things I've seen
This sounds hella supportive.
i kinda want 5-alphareductase deficiency now :(
Definitely support. He's educating them on how science actually backs up the fact that gender snd sex or more complex than black & white
This make very happy
When they said ""you can have two X chromosomes and have a male heart and brain"" that really got me
Finally something that speak correctly about biology. I would like to add: SRY is a gene responsible for the development of male genitalia, but it's also...you know, a gene, and genes comes in many different forms, called alleles so...which allele is the ""Real male""? The manliest of them all? How can we decide? And if a someone has a SRY gene that is also inefficient in its function, how do we decide when a SRY gene is male and when it is not? Since a gene can have a spectrum of efficiency, the fenotype it determines also will have a spectrum of efficiency, and how about mosaicism?
You can't reduce genetics to just ""this does that"", it is more complex than that.
It's a mixed bag.

It's supportive in the sense that this person is completely dismantling chromosome-based arguments about gender identity (good!) but the way they're explaining all the human examples, many of the ""male"" and ""female"" labels are still referring to the *body* rather than the mind.

That is, they're still based in a cis-centric understanding of gender identity as being something fundamentally body-based.

Yes, they end with some proper ""heart and brain"" understanding of gender identity, but in context I don't think it overcomes the body-centric focus of the majority of their points.

So it's good, but it could have been better.
Idk but surely ""cuttlefish"" has got to be the new term for someone pretending a gender for ulterior motives?

Edit: I'm in no way meaning to support the idea that that is common as transphobe narratives would have it. More in the sense of ""what, are you calling me a cuttlefish?""
I think it's an attempt to take science away from the farts to justify their horrid opinions
Supportive but ultimately misguided. Arguing on the terms of transphobes is all well and good because transphobes have literally no good or logical points, but it's wasting time debunking bad faith arguments. The support, however, is endlessly appreciated, waste of time or no.
Not bad, but i personally would've been like ""thats the difference between sex and gender. Science. Biology science. Brain knowledge.""
Chromosomes play a part but is not absolute as they are just compact, organised sets of genes and genes can have alternative forms (alleles).  DNA/genes/alleles can be reshuffled before expression and there are many ways RNA can be modified before making protein, proteins can be modified/interacted with other molecules (many) before they do ""what they are designed to do"" and even at that point can have many interactions/effects.  The design of a biological entity with every protein, carb, lipid, nucleic acid, et al all in the whole metabolism is to interact in someway with the environment which in turn (unavoidable) will interact with that entity, even directly/indirectly affecting the expression of genes.

I still say that chromosomal/genetic sex creating an average set of characteristics is (at this moment from what I and others understand so far) still useful to keep but (like everything in science) its understanding should be expanded to encompass its full complexity.  Nothing mcan be done (at the moment) to change chromosomes, but that shouldn't stop people from being trans.  Likely because its their chromosomes in how they were expressed is what allowed them to be who they are.  That's why I personally prefer to understand myself as a biological entity and aware of everything in me (from what we do and can know) rather than just a simple label.

Biology major, hope this helps
Why are you even asking this?🤦‍♀️
Learn to read dumbass.
I think neither. It isn’t really about trans people at all. But it’s also not wrong, and good for them for arguing with bigots. 

I could do without the example of cuttlefish “looking and acting like females because they are trying to get close enough to actual females to mate with them,” because that really is what the transphobes think about trans women and they WILL use it as ammo.
She is ignoring the full spectrum. Of genetics, she is taking what she likes and running with it. But intersex is a real thing, and a good number of people don't even know they technically are through what their genetics show. But it still only shows one genders  traits. This is from my time studying as I a biology and human science field. So I don't know where her being a teacher does anything, especially if she is teaching below college where you don't have the freedom of research and resources. Every genetics break down would prove her wrong. (We are all female starting out in the wowmb.)

So, I would say they are being supportive in using facts to help defend the reality of gender spectrum. Because it is a spectrum. Not black and white. Deffinately seems supportive to me, at least.
No
Kinda neutral sounding. Scientifically sound. Meh.
I think they’re basically saying that Biology isn’t as simple as “XY and XX” and to not use grade 1 biology to justify being an asshole
They're trying their best
Learned something new lol
have no clue at all, i have very smooth brain!!!
but i know that it reminded me of a lyric: 

“It's not a mutation; it's just the way I am. Whether that's X or Y”

anyway literally was not on topic at all but i just really like this song-
""It's basic biology!"" has always been a lazy argument that makes me laugh. 

""Basic chemistry"" teaches children that there are 3 phases of matter: solid, liquid, and gas.  This is so we can ease kids into the subject without overwhelming them.  Then we learn about plasma at some point, probably in high school.  If you continue in chemistry or physics post-secondary you learn about Bose-einstein condensates, quark-gluon plasma, superfluids, Fermionic condensates, Rydberg matter, and plenty of other exotic states.

""Basic math"" deals with integers, and the 5 primary functions: addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, and exponents.  More advanced math uses letters and symbols, far more complex functions, and even irrational numbers. 

But for some reason, these morons never got past ""basic biology"" and assume they know everything there is to know because they remember ONE lesson on genetics and chromosomes.  Life is far more complex than they realize, and their attempts to put everyone into exactly two boxes, even though it obviously doesn't work, would be comical if it weren't also literally killing people.
This is absolutely pro. Literal scientific examples of genome differences in nature, and how that likely extends to humans since it's not at all uncommon.

This person is showing that biology tends to disagree with the shitheads that say bigoted, transphobic shit.
Fascinating
Supportive unless you’re nonbinary
Definitely supportive!

Pointing out that the XX/XY “it’s basic biology” argument is scientifically, *empirically* inaccurate because biology is NEVER simple. It’s not simple in non-human animals and it’s UNDOUBTEDLY not simple in humans. The person points out that intersex people exist and that trans people exist (“you can be male because you have two X chromosomes but your heart and brain are male”). 

Also, if a person uses the word “transphobic” to describe another person’s actions, there’s a solid chance that they are educated and supportive of trans folk! It’s not a guaranteed thing but transphobes rarely genuinely use the word transphobic.
Supportive 100%
It's supportive with the very last sentence, however it would've been nice if they also explained that biological gender isn't just about chromosomes. Taking HRT literally changes our biological gender as well. It doesn't change as much as we'd like to obviously, but it does enough to change our gender scientifically.
it doesnt completely represent the thoughts and feelings of trans people but its a good dumbed down explanation for cis people who cannot understand how we feel at all
Supportive.
i believe this is supportive, as they prove that science is not simple
He destroys transphobes with not so basic biology
Supportive, no doubt.
Why does it feel like we have to have a council meeting before accepting support?
Supportive, but in some places misguided. You're not going to win over ignorant people by comparing humans to slime moulds and flatworms. It's better to focus on humans and explain (in simple terms) why chromosomes aren't the ultimate denominator of sex that transphobes believe them to be.
The second last sentence says ""Don't use science to justify bigotry"" so I'm pretty sure it's against transphobia, as in it's saying that science doesn't support bigoted viewpoints.
I say supportive tho
I say supportive tho
The last two sentences are all you need to read if you are in doubt of the authors intent.  F\* yea love seeing basic biology bitches get owned.
this is a very supportitive post as it not just debunks the myth of fixed gender, but also the myth of fixed sex, and the cis sexist act of forcing the xx and xy binary concept on every other thing in this world, which, as this person says, will never be anything short of bullshit. 

It's the long and extended version of ""your basic biology is just very fucking basic and nothing even remotely more advanced works as a basis for your bigotry, so shut the fuck up and let trans (and intersex) people be""
Why the hell would that be offensive? It’s spot on!
I dont see how one would see this as offensive
I like it. It's a rebuttal to the people who treat their vague memories of a 7th grade life science class they got a C- in, as conclusive proof that trans people can't exist. They deserve to get pwned by an irl actual scientist/science teacher. 

There's a [great video](https://youtu.be/szf4hzQ5ztg) on this that I like to post when people use those shitty arguments (although 95% of them probably either don't bother to open the video, or barely make it 30 seconds in before losing interest)
I think it’s meant to be supportive for sure
100% this is support
That’s supportive. They’re explaining that in reference to biological science, sex and gender are way more complicated than most people realise or care to learn about. In the “human” paragraph they list a variety of intersex conditions before saying “you can be male because you have two X chromosomes, but your heart and brain are male.”, describing a trans man and including that in their definition of a valid way to be male.
I have pieces of y chromosomes that are attached to my x chromosome making me intersex. Do I count?
i think this post is supportive and i appreciate the person posting it. even though it doesn't use the most commonly accepted lanugage to talk about gender issues, it's still an explicitly pro-trans post.
Yeah basically proving that biology is not as black and white as bigots with rocks for brains insist it is.
The transgender phenomena is a tangible, biological phenomena because **our species fucking exhibit it**. 

Same can be said for any emotional/spiritual/intellectual phenomena. I'm so tired
I would say supportive, we know science is on our side. Their point is that the bigots post isn't even accurate to science and a shit argument to begin with. That nothing with our species is black and white and if you're going to be a bigot don't try to use ""science"" to make it seem like you're anything other than a bigot.
I don't see how anyone could interpret this as transphobic. This person is doing a very good job at shutting down a dumb argument.
The intent is be supportive. As much as I love to see someone who knows biology try to educate the BaSiC bIoLoGy set, and as much as I think this science is cool and interesting in the abstract, I don't think anatomical science is really a relevant argument for the validity of trans people? 

The reason trans people are valid is because we're not livestock and we shouldn't have to define ourselves by our reproductive anatomy, and that's a philosophical point, not a scientific one.
Bigots can go much beyond a thought that is about one sentence length. They'll never get sex spectrum.  It's absolutely not relative to me being trans but I've tried to use the XXY as a stepping stone for them to maybe get trans. These people attack anyone different.. they'd be the ones at public stonings etc in the mob. They are primitive! 🥺
he's using science to disprove transphobes
The vast majority of transphobes hate the word ""transphobia"", so if you see someone use it unironically, chances are they're not a transphobe
Supportive of the fact that *sex* is much more complicated than XX/XY, definitely. And a much needed defense at that. But that's not *necessarily* a pro trans argument. Gender ≠ sex. I personally don't like using ""male"" and ""female"" to talk about gender, and this person says something along the lines of ""your body might be [male/female] but your brain and heart are [female/male]"" as an argument supporting trans people. However, it kinda obscures the difference between gender and sex as one being a social construct and another being biological. I don't think there's anything wrong with this argument, tho, as it's not exactly trying to be anything other than ""trans people valid"" which ofc I support. It's just simplistic and kinda confused imo. And in the end, noone needs a *biologist* to validate their gender from a biological perspective, precisely because gender is sociocultural and each of us can and should have the final say on our own gender. Mind that the sentence in essence is saying that you are who you say you are, which is cool! It's just using biological terms and mixing it in with biological phenomena.
It is supportive but difficult to follow.
How is it in favour of trans hate?
Ok, I'm probably in the minority here, but I don't love most of this comment. The only part that I do like is the last bit, because that's why trans people are valid. If someone claims ""male is xy, female is xx"", and your response is to point out that a percentage of people do not neatly fit into one of those categories, they can let those people be exceptions, but if you are not in one of those groups, still consider you invalid. Obviously the claims made in this post are true, but this post was written (presumably) to defend trans people, of whom a minority have one of the listed conditions. By countering a cellular argument with a cellular argument, it feels like admitting that gender is cellularly/hormonally/sex-characteristically determined, which it is not. Still a good post and I agree with the sentiment, but seeing such an emphasis on physical/cellular traits bugs me.
100%
Basically someone who knows anything higher than 6th grade biology is talking to an adult toddler
I enjoy being a trans biologist for this reason haha
Plan B: use religion
Don't assume their pronouns.
A lot of your DNA is not a reliable metric for determining anything, as many genes rely  on environmental factors to express themselves. Run a simulator of someone's life with the same genes, but growing up in 100 different times and places, and you will have 100 totally different people.

Anti intellectualism is all about that, refusing to accept that high schools teach a simplified story on all subjects, so when experts disagree it's not because they learned the nuance of reality, it's because they are dumb indoctrinated liberals. Trying to explain exactly how the real world is nuanced in explicit detail is helpful, it's just super fucking hard.
Previous commenters on fb were offended at being compared to fish.
it is called scientific ...
This keeps being pointed out, sex, isn’t one thing, and those things aren’t binary nor necessarily in alignment with each other.

If you know ANYTHING about sex, that should be obvious, but these bigots…
Yeah I second this. Though, I don't think the intent was to share something harmful.
If you had asked me a week ago, I’d agree it’s harmful, but you tell me if I’m performing mental gymnastics: I’m in the military and as of recent have found myself in the middle of heated “culture war” debates, most recently discussing gun politics and covid. 

My conservative coworkers claim if someone dies due to gun violence or covid in America, it’s the way things were meant to be, aka natural selection. 

This entire post, assuming it’s proven accurate, is jet fuel in favor of my perspective. I’m not saying it should be a primary facet of our argument- to be flaunted the first round of debates- but in the current context, according to their logic isn’t the existence of Transbians simply natural selection?
The person offended by this is an exception I wouldn’t worry.
Misogynoir? I apologize, I've just never heard the term before.  I assume that's the intersection of racism and misogyny?  (Just was curious, I promise I'm not asking in bad faith or anything).

 I agree with what you're saying as well, people really do have a lot of capacity for doing beautiful things, even if the world seems (and often can be) evil and heartless.
its more of a debunking of the genetic ""argument"" (XX female XY male)
So still a good thing to show people who are uneducated?
This is the first time I’ve posted this. I posted it a while ago on fb, but like I said, got worried I might be offending people when I saw the upset comments. Sorry if this is an oft-repeated post. Just want to make sure I’m respectful in what I’m saying.
Report back and educate us! :-)
Try one of those sites that lets you create your own tshirt :-D like customink.com or Shutterfly.
I explained in a comment, because it doesn’t let you add text to an image post. There were commenters where that is from, on fb, offended at being compared to fish, like they were so low I guess.
I think it’s supportive, but someone got offended at being compared to a fish when I posted it elsewhere, and since I’m not trans, I am not equipped with the right to definitively say it’s fully supportive of the community or not. Maybe it was just a couple people and the majority like it.
Great comparison! (Not sarcasm)
Do it! :-)
❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤍
Do it :-)
You’re not going to come out? :-(
I think they're focusing on the body there because that's what phobes tend to be preoccupied by. I get it; it is at the forefront since it's what one can actually see.
Is the allele reshuffling and RNA modification responsible for things like identical twins with the same DNA being different?
Thanks for your input and emoticon. Maybe read one single comment made by me explaining? Since you can’t post text in an image post? And don’t be a jerk.
The irony when if you learned to read other comments you wouldn’t need this one.
Ok actually I missed the fourth- and third-to-last sentences—definitely feels more supportive with that part
[deleted]
I didn’t want to think I was showing support if I was actually offending people, since I’m not coming from a place of being trans myself, and when posted on fb, people got offended at being compared to a fish.
People on fb were offended at being compared to fish and bugs.
Of course you count! ❤️
""It's basic biology""

Like yeah BASIC biology. Like elementary level. Anyone who understands past that basic level of biology would know you're full of shit
Am I the adult toddler?
it's made me hate my own field of study (psychology) as an autistic trans person.
Me literally obsessed with all things science as mtf LOL
True. That experiment has been done many times, on identical twins separated at birth.
Thank you, I forget I can post links here lmao (used to Twitch ig)
Blubblub I don’t see any problem with being a fish sounds fun
I mean, halfway through they say “Oh, did you mean humans” and then spent the rest of the post talking about human genetics only, so I think people complaining about a fish analogy are missing the forest for the trees here.
""No animals are gay! It's unnatural!""
""Actually, they are...""
""Uhmm well uh... we are not animals!""


The words ""natural"" and ""science"" are used to their convenience.

For the gay argument I like to say ""no animal gets married, even straight marriage is unnatural""
I don’t think there’s any actual comparison in the post. They’re simply describing how nature in general can be really funky, therefore countering the argument “2 sexes is NATURE!”

They then go on to give human-specific examples which relate to intersex conditions and disorders of sex development etc. Now they’re showing how *humans* don’t even follow the binary
Those commenters sound pretty stupid.  We evolved from fish, of course.  Even knowing every form of life on earth is different...just allow it to be a  an overview of how different species ended up with all sorts of different ways to reproduce and be in the world.  It's interesting; they're dicks.  The end.
Well that's why. Facebook isn't generally a good gauge for whether something is offensive or not (neither is Reddit for that matter, but obviously this subreddit is way more progressive than the rest of this site lol). I left Facebook due to the rampant transphobia and just the general alt-right opinions on there.
funny enough in some biologic classification systems humans are fish, because you are not able to get a branch form the evolution tree that includes goldfish and sharks, but no humans.
I would be honored to be compared to fish
Yet the same probably compare others to vermin/insects etc. Funny... Y'know in a not very funny way
It is, and some people might have problems to understand that. I also think that most transphobic people doesn't care for any argument anyway. There's no treatment for being ignorant.
Oh yeah, 100%. Like I said, they're for sure pro trans. It's just a mighty, unfortunate addition.
It's very over simplified especially when it comes to human genetics but it's roughly accurate. 

I will point out that the majority of fish do have chromosomal sex determination too, but some are ZW and some are XY. Also snakes and lizards have chromosomal sex determination (ZW) but other reptiles do have environmentally determined sex determination like they allude to. 

There's some obfuscation here of the fact that there is in fact a central definition to what makes a creature male or female in a biological sense and it probably is one that transphobes wouldn't object to (they just don't know enough about biology to point to it). In all species that produce two different kinds of gametes, females are the ones who produce the larger ones (eggs) and males are the ones who produce the smaller ones (sperm) -- that's why we say ""male seahorses get pregnant"" instead of saying that's the female sex because it looks more superficially similar to human females. 

It totally misses the point though imo. Gender is a complex social structure built on top of sex. Yeah, most of us fall into either the male or female category biologically speaking (the only people who don't are those who never developed internal sex organs / can't produce either eggs or sperm). But that really, *really* shouldn't have any bearing on our gender, pronouns, clothing, social roles, even what hormones we choose to take as medicines, as none of that is biologically predetermined.
Yeah, you are doing mental gymnastics. Basically, natural selection is not something that is relevant to humans. Humans have consistently made advances to overcome natural selection. Additionally, natural selection and humans value very different things

Stephan Hawking is a highly valued figure to humans due to his knowledge and intelligence, but to natural selection. He should have been left to die as he could not have survived on his own. You can not both value him and enforce natural selection as the ""correct"" process. 

If you feel human advancements are part of natural selection. Then how about mass shootings. Most mass shooters are mentally ill and typically have ideas destructive to society aka: Human survival. If the shooter survives, were the, presumably, better functioning members of society contributing less to human survival than the shooter? 

As you'll notice in both paragraphs, human advancements are the reason how natural selection is able to be defied. Stephan Hawking is allowed to survive through technological advancement despite not being fit to survive. While the shooter is able to remove multiple more fit humans through means of human advancement, aka firearms. 

In short, you can not apply natural selection to humans anymore because modern humans just don't play by those rules anymore. Citing it as a reason as to why X group doesn't *really* matter feels like eugenics with extra steps. 

Also, as an addendum because I'm admittedly a bit miffed at your last line. I'm a transbian with a cis-fiance. And we're expecting in august via natural conception. So your last line is 100% wrong.
yeah, I learned that’s what misogynoir is. It’s so particular to what black women experience. Transmisogynoir is a whole thing too - if you’re in NY you’ll see how black trans women are treated completely differently and dehumanized by all these cruel, thoughtless behaviors and policies.  It frustrates me when people want to reduce us to our biology, when we’re clearly such special beings…it’s one of the few things I’m religious about: that humans were put here as caretakers
I can see that
In response to someone claiming chromosomes are the end all factor. I would say it passes but thats only if the person your replying to considers humans similar to other animals, And sometimes they dont and think were special.
Other scientists have absolutely said the same things you have here. And its effective for arguing with centrists, especially if they havent seen this before. I find it respectful enough because its true, and i hate it when people decide not to listen to facts just because someone is ""rude"" or ""cold""
Woah, the real fun guy is Schizophyllum commune with over 23,000 sexes 

Sexy Fun Guys

One species of fungi, Schizophyllum commune, really shines when it comes to gender diversity. The white, fan-shaped mushroom has more than 23,000 different sexual identities, a result of widespread differentiation in the genetic locations that govern its sexual behavior. 
huh. well, that's that i guess. i just think fish are cool🦈
Oh, that person was probably trolling or just looking for something to be mad over lol
I came out to my  wife, and at home i’m dressed feminine,  I don't hide it, but my wife is very scared that other people will see it,  she even told me that in case I would transition, she divorce me, in  2 weeks we are going on vacation with one of our kids and she wants me to let my body hair grow and wear male clothes all of the time,  i’m feeling desperate allready
I don't know much about twins other than the two types and that some genes/phenotypes can appear differently  in different degrees in twins (concordance).
You’re failure to clarify in a post does not constitute an issue for me when one is forced to look into comments for an explanation.
Yeah, I am just agreeing that what they are saying is supportive. That first part was just making a point that the ""teacher"" isn't properly educated to know the truth about intersex and true gender spectrum, I am not downing what the post says at all. Just my own repeating of basically what they said probably unnecessary, but it's what went through my head when i saw this. I am just agreeing. That's all.
I am sorry that it didn't seem very clear. But in the first section, you can see towards the end I say the teacher has no backing because she is probably only a high school teacher or lower. Meaning they don't get the full freedom of information, they can only teach what the parents in that school will vote in. She couldn't have a true understanding of intersex. 

The second is just saying how this post IS a supportive post for the community.
Hell a 5 minute google search about definitions of gender and effects of HRT would already clear things up way past basic biology.
“Basic biology” also says hibernation is just a long ass nap. It’s not, it’s completely different.
Exaclty. Like basic math says that the square root of -1 doesn't exist. Or basic physics says that there are three states of matter, or any myriad of examples.
No I think they meant the opposite
Really? How come? I'd be very interested to hear about your experiences on the subject.
I would add, even with those not separated at birth. Same DNA and different people.
np, had the link handy, the vid's also one of my gotos
I know this is really weird, and I have no idea why, but since I was a little kid I always really loved the “blub blub” sounds fish make 😂 I think I was jealous
Literally yeah. It’s not even a fish *analogy* it’s just saying that the first person’s “logic” in inaccurate in several, several ways and binary gender has nothing to do with actual biology in any creature
But our ancestors been apes and we share the same DNA for % , so aren't we animals...xd/s I have no idea if humans are still animals hahaha but maybe I should look into that

Edit wait we are animals 👀
I think it's good to dunk their asses using the jargon when they try to pretend to be scientists, themselves though. 

I wouldn't expect he'd use this language when talking to people who don't claim to know science.
except pounding it in with .... but that would be uncivilized
Yeah, they just like using “science” to give their bigotry a sheen of credibility. When, of course, there is no credibility to it, they’re just evil. 

It’s just phrenology, bigots using pseudoscience
Unfortunately they are. I mean even if we prove them wrong they're always gonna make some shit up and be hatred -.-
Surely even a terf wouldn’t be moronic enough to pick and choose just that one tiny part and discard the rest… right?
Duly noted. Thanks 😊
I love fish too :-)
She doesn’t sound very loyal and loving. Though I have no room to say that really if you’ve been married so long; you know her better than I do. It seems like you’re between a rock and a hard place. She doesn’t want you to be who you feel you are. It seems some spouses - from people I’ve known only - get embarrassed, like it’s a reflection on them. That’s not okay.
If you feel forced into this post in any way, consider yourself forced out of it. I hate how obvious trolls are when they think they’re being stealthy. If you’re not a troll, then instead of reiterating an insult in a reply, please enlighten me on means of clarifying a post without Reddit giving the allowance to post anything in an image post but said image. But no normal person who isn’t here to troll and hurt would ever be like this without malevolent provocation on such a supportive post by someone speaking on how they want to stand up for the trans community. I really doubt anything at all is an issue for you standing in the way of trying to hurt others.
Yeah hormones are literally a huge part of ur sex so taking hormones does change your sexual features and, therefore, changes ur sex. Ppl js don't wanna admit that you can change ur sex. There's no reason to be like ""well you were born that way"" when so much changes from the moment you were born to now.
The even bigger thing here specifically is, that this isn't about Gender in the ""Societal Structure"", but about the male and female sex. Even if someone bigoted might say shit like ""I don't care how you feel, you were agab, and you'll always will be and there's nothing that can change that"" you can easily point at cases, where said change simply happened naturally
No that's not ""basic biology"" it's parents or teachers or some other guardian that just says that instead of explaining what it actually is
Oh good! I’ve been a bit worried I look stupid for asking if it’s offensive when everyone is saying it’s very clearly supportive. I just wanted to check with the community before taking action speaking for you.
hmm... let me rephrase that a bit. i hate what right-wing armchair psychologists have done with any discourse around psychology, and specifically around autism. 

it's made trying to talk about those things outside of more professional settings virtually toxic to engage with.
I'm married to an identical twin. They are very very different people.
It's such a good video
You. You get it!
Yes we are lol.

Also believing in evolution is the devils doing obviously
Sometimes you just have to do that (especially when they start taking away your civil rights)
But the scientist also explained how chromosomes and genitals don't have to match in a singular way in humans. So that should be good in any case
I know, but i’m in a difficult situation.  Got recovered from the decease and getting blind from an other, so I have to depend on her and other family
No one is insulting you. You’re making something out of nothing when I asked a simple question for the sole reason of you not wanting to answer it. If anything, you’re provoking me, not vice versa. 

Please relax and reflect on yourself.
Which the exact same thing as the “basic biology” they spout.
concur!
This is amazing lmao. I'm cis (kind of? trans but it doesn't affect my life enough for a transition to be worthwhile?? Like I'm non-binary but I would present fem anyway so?).

Just wanted to stop in to say that, can I join the blub blub club? 👉🏻👈🏻 I've always wanted to be a fish lol.
Yesss, lets pound those terfs with our cool trans superpowers 

/hj
Is other family supportive?
“Relax” “smoke some grass” just another thing all trolls do to try and irritate as much as possible, some pathetic control tactic. If they get frustrated at your infantilizing, you can just say “hey, hey! I was only trying to help! See, look how much you need to relax.” Maybe passive aggression goes by most people unnoticed but you’re talking to someone well-versed in psychology. Keep responding with passive-aggressive hits in a way that keeps you sounding “sweet”. Along with the gaslighting. “That never happened! I never said or did that!” You guys really need to step it up. If this makes you feel good though, keep doing it. I just hope your life gets to a point where you can feel fulfilled without this sort of bullshit. Now respond with more infantilizing, gaslighting, telling me I’m overreacting, it’s all in my head, and I just need to calm down and relax, because I can recognize and dissect said bullshit. 😂😂I’m waiting.
Yes :)
I don't hide a lot of things to my children and are supportive
Again, making some more out of what isn’t there. I’m trans, but it amazes me how there are people such as yourself that are aggressive when they feel even the slightest bit threatened by a stranger on the internet. 

Oh, and you can keep waiting and keep replying, because I can tell that you needed an argument to start anyway. This is the kind of attention you like, yeah?
Perhaps if you thought to add context to the post rather than force people to read a comment and expect them to automatically know that it exists, this wouldn’t happen. This is no one’s fault but your own.
Nevermind. All of your comments that you make on multiple subreddits are you calling anyone and everyone a “troll” and starting arguments or jumping into arguments with a lot of people. You relish this kind of garbage.💀
This made me so irrationally happy, thank you :"")
Maybe you could just depend on the ones who are supportive ❤️
You’re welcome :D"	11n1s5p	trans	3425	0.98	2023-03-09 19:48:53
I'm leaving the community	"Update (09/14/2022): Turns out that I was wrong about being a cis man. I'm actually still a trans woman, just that I was really deep in denial at the time. But thanks to therapy my egg hatched and now I can go on living as a trans woman. In celebration of that, I created a AMA post in discussions in order so that you can learn more about what I am up to right now.

Original post:

Hi all! I got some good and bad news to share. The good news is that I have finally figured out my gender. It turns out that I am actually a cis het guy, and that my gender dysphoria was just a symptom of the childhood trauma that I had unfortunately experienced. Which leads to the bad news, in which I have to say farewell to the trans community as well as the larger lgbt+ community as a whole due to now being anything but queer.

That said, I just want to thank everyone who came to support and encourage me to find myself in my darkest hour. I really appreciate all that you have done, and as a result I will always be a proud ally to your fight for equality and representation. It is the least that I can do after all the kindness you have shown to me this past month.

Farewell, friends."	"All I care about is that you’re happy and comfortable with your decision! Go live your life and continue to be happy!
The queer community is all about finding yourself, and I applaud you for doing so, even if it means you're no longer part of the community.

But you'll be an ally who has a hell of an inside view :)
It's a beautiful thing when someone fully understands who they are.
I don't see you realizing your CIS meaning you have to leave the community.  We need allies more now than ever and remaining plugged into the community will allow you to continue to be informed.  That said if you feel this is a step you need to take I totally understand that as well.

I hope you hang around, but it not, I hope you continue to be happy!
Happy for you that you figured yourself out and I wish you all the best in dealing with those traumatic experiences from your childhood. We always need allies so feel free to stick around :)
I'm really happy for you :)

Most cis folk never actually query their gender, they just go with what they were told; if you've actually examined yourself and know that you're really cis het, that's a big step!
Okay but I hope your identity still leaves room for you to use conditioner. Nobody is so cishet they need 2in1 shampoo & bodywash
Hey, I'm glad you found your way and you know what you want in your future now, but why do you have to leave? Who is anyone to gatekeep you from staying in this community? People here have helped you, you might want to help people here.

I think your experience and journey would be a great addition here, it would be a shame if you stopped participating.
Congrats on figuring out yourself, it's nice to have a good ally
Aww I am happy you have found your way ♥ Be happy my dude, walk strong! You're never alone ♥
Happy that you found yourself after al that time! Remember we love you whoever or whatever you are
i will screenshoot the fuck out of this OP and comments so show off the next time someone will acuse us of been too pushy on femboys and queer-questioning people

thanks for a lovely thread OP :D
The entire point of the queer community is so that people can feel safe to experiment, explore, and find who they are and what makes them happiest.


I’m glad you found you, and if you feel you have to leave so be it. But at least for me, you will always be welcome here, and you are always welcome to reach out to me directly if you need to talk.
Glad the community could show you the support you needed to work yourself out! So happy for you that you pieced you’re identity together and can live as yourself :)
It isn't ""bad news"" to figure out you're not trans (obviously the trauma part is bad news); it's actually great news! Just like figuring out you're trans means you're that much closer to knowing who you are, figuring out you really are cis means the exact same thing. So, I would, if anything, say congratulations are in order! 

Additionally, you don't really have to leave the community. Allies are always welcome.
Time will tell if you are correct in your realization. If you do have gender dysphoria it will not go away. If you are correct then at least you understand the struggles of Transgender people. You don't need to abandon us. We need allies like your self that understand the struggle.
That's totally valid, bro! I hope you found the labels useful while you had them, and I wish you well on your journey xx
Good luck and glad you figured you out. All the best
I’m sorry you had some trauma that really affected you and made some things confusing :(, but glad you took the time and effort to confront it and figure yourself out. :)

I haven’t seen anything else you’ve posted >~<, but I’m glad the rest of the community here was able to offer some guidance and support :).

Realizing that this path doesn’t affirm who you are, even after exploring it, does not make you a fraud or any less human. I think it even adds more to who you are by your willingness to face that and figure out who you are and what’s right for you. 

I wish you the best of luck homie :).
Thanks for stopping by!!
Trying on labels and experimenting while you are figuring yourself out on these crucial things is not time or energy wasted. You are returning to your old label this time with an understanding of yourself that you did not have before.

Best wishes on the rest of your healing journey.
Congratulations. Trans or cis it’s good for all of us to discover who we are
But your experiences and journey are valuable. Why not stay and help those on a similar journey?
Best of luck my dude! Congratulations on the self discovery and I wish you all the best as you heal.
glad you figured yourself out!! what matters is that you're happy with yourself and that you now get to heal :) best of luck!!
Good luck on your journey friend.    ☺️
It's great you've done self- exploration, hope things go better for you in the future :)
That’s okay! Experimenting with gender is something everyone should do to get a better idea of who they are! No shame in it! Continue on being happy, you’re still welcome here as an ally 💜
Goodbye have good day
Hey I really hope you start healing from your trauma and I’m proud of you for finding yourself.
Congrats on figuring urself out! :D
Congrats on figuring yourself out!
You're still valid, and a friend of the community❤️🏳️‍⚧️👋
Quitter. Just kidding. Big hugs and hugs kudos to you for doing that work.
Good luck on your journey forward! And I'm happy you were able to find yourself!

Also, the radio litterally just started playing See you Again by Wiz Khalifa lol. Almost feels kinda appropriate for your situation
Wow, thank you for sharing your journey here 💜 we appreciate you and wish you all the best!
YAY!!!
SO GLAD YOU WERE ABLW TO WORK THROUGH YOUR STUFF, sorry things took a longer route to healing but I wish you the best : , )
So happy for you
Now you can be awesome ally to the community, be the best boyfriend to a trans girl, or if your journey leads you back here, we’re happy to welcome you back! ☺️
I'm very happy for you that you figured out your gender:)
I WISH YOU WELL!
Even if you aren't any of the letters you are always welcome in the community spaces. LGBTQ+ is all about figuring out who you are and accepting everyone's differences. You are welcome in LGBTQ+ spaces any time, really, feel free to lurk or comment/give advice if it's asked for. 

Congrats on finding your identity and good luck in therapy, good job😄
congratulations on figuring yourself out, dude! good luck in the future!

and remember, even if you're not a part of the trans community now, allies are always welcome here :)
Im happy you've discovered more about yourself good luck with your journey!!
How did you figure it out? And how do I figure it out? It’s too confusing >.<
We’ll miss you! Thank you for being so kind about everything. I hope your trauma heals somewhat so the symptoms of gender dysphoria dissipate. Have a good life ! <3
We still love you. If anything, that experience of self discovery has helped you become a more rock-solid ally than most - feel more than welcome to stick around :3
This is so sweet but so sad, it's great that you found out more about yourself!
Exploring and finding your truth is what it's all about, and discovering yourself is validating regardless of that outcome. Thank you for sharing your journey and best to you moving forward!
I'm glad you're comfortable in your identity, and I hope that you'll continue to support us :)
""it's not about winning or losing it's about the friends you made along the way""

Congrats on finding your true identity!
Congratulations! Im glad ur comfortable in ur skin and figured things out. Thats the only thing that matters :]
Congrats on figuring out who you are!
Congrat !! Hope you will be okay and all the trans-internet is proud of u ♡♡
I don't think you need to leave; you're a lot different from a person who needs their gender assigned to them, and conforms to it without question. Being trans to me is about exercising your right to express your gender how you want.
Glad you figured things out hunny 🙂
Farewell friend 👋
Congrats to finding urself bro
This is a place as much for people with transgender experiences as those who ARE trans.

Just the fact that you embraced gender non conforming paths to discover you're mostly cishet means you are actually queer AF and will always be welcome here ❤️

PS. Keep that courage in the years to come. There are surely more surprises of self discovery waiting for you.
Its a bittersweet thing, i know i dont know you bit its kinda lile you gradiated and now get out in world leaving the nest. 

Anyways, hope you find your happily ever after my dude 🤟
Understandable, but we the community need inside Allie’s more than ever. If you truly wish to leave then no worries, just know we are always here.
I'm happy that you're making progress in resolving your trauma, best of luck in your journey, you're still welcome here even if you're not Trans. Farewell.
that's totally fine man! I'm glad you realized your identity even if its not apart of the community. Best of luck and know that you'll always have a place here as an ally. <3 Farwell friend :)
I think most people just want you to happy, go grow yourself 😁
Well, glad you figured yourself out. Plus you'll always have hella an inside view on queer communities that most cishet people never will get.
it doesn't matter what you are as long as you're kind. the knowledge you have fought for and earned is yours. I wish you only the best, and that you are happy. you're always welcome and appreciated as an ally
Glad you were able to figure yourself out, wishing you the best mate. 🙌
Congratulations on finding yourself, dude
As long as you’re being true to yourself… that’s what matters.
The lgbtq+ community is all about supporting others and helping them find themselves, and it can be very difficult. I’m glad you were able to figure out what was right for you!
Me 6 months on E: huh I also had a lot of childhood trauma….oh no I’m doubting again
This is so good to hear. Proud of you for getting to know yourself better and having the courage to confront your past!
As long as you're happy we'll be here for you, trans or not!  That's what the lgbtq+ community should strive for, people being willing to find themselves and feel comfortable with yourself, and I'm glad you found that ❤️
Sad to see you go, but it is your decision and I will respect that. 

Also congratulations on figuring out about yourself.
Wish you luck and we are always here for u!!
I'm really happy for you for finding yourself, and not going to lie - a bit envious. Eight years in and I still question whether I still made the right choice sometimes. With that said... I'll leave you with a quote from my favorite Hashira - a character who a few years back helped me make peace with my own masculinity:

“Go ahead and live with your head held high! No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness…set your heart ablaze. Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.”
I’m curious how your dysphoria manifested and how you determined that it was from trauma and not identity-linked? I would love for this to be the case for me and put all of this behind me lol.
i dont see why you would have to leave. if you have friends around here, you could just stay, not like youre required to prove your identity to anyone. in fact you can share your  kindness to others in the community, even being cis. up to you tho, and only if youre willing. i wish you luck in future endevours regardless
I’m glad you figured yourself out and are on the path to healing! Best of luck in whatever your future will entail ☺️❤️
If you ever wanna visit just say hi!!!
You know realistically you don't have to leave the community; you can still be a part of this without being trans
Well, we all love and welcome you anyways. It's good that you found yourself! I hope I can achieve that too one day!
Glad you figured things out.

Anyone who is respectful is always welcome, trans or not, so you don't have to leave if you don't want to :)
congrats on being sure
you chose what's best for you. i wish everything will go smoothly from now on!!! :3
Pls don't leave.. You sound like a cool guy..
I'm really glad you figured yourself out!
You can always stay as a supporter
Would you mind if i PM you, i have a few questions, specifically if you could share what trauma it was or how you realized it. Im struggling with gender identity as well, and a very toxic family, so im constantly thinking about the chance im just too traumatized and actually not a girl.
I’m proud of you!! Self exploration is all a long journey we are going through, and I hope that our community was able to help you in any way!! I wish you luck on your continuing life journey!! :)
Hope you’re doing ok man, take care of yourself, and just know you’re always welcome in these spaces
Best wishes, and you’re always welcome back if things change
I'm so happy you found yourself. Just continue as you deem fit my friend.
I know you have your reasons for going, and they're totally valid and reasonable and I don't want to stop you, but remember that the reason we call it the lgbt+ community is because the acronym was unwieldy when it was LGBTQQIA (and growing), and the A stands for ally. You're welcome back any time you're ready.
That’s ok! Gender is a journey even if it turns out you’re cis. You understand why you’re like this and can feel more confident in your gender. glad to have you while you were here.
You know I think in a lot of ways this was a nest, but some people reach a certain point of flight where they're comfortable enough to go out and be themselves, whether that be any variation were all just human and we come here feeling scared and alone and hoping to learn from others Introspect, and it's a beautiful thing I'm so happy for you,  I'm so glad you found help here like so many people do, best wishes !!!
The queer comunity is always here to support you, no matter what. Be well and I hope the best for you
farewell my friend, i only hope that you live the best life possible ! the queer community is one big tent. even if you don’t fit inside of the identities here, you’re welcome here! 

i also hope you do deconstruct that trauma, i know that road can be difficult.
Hugs to you on your journey through healing. LGBTQIA+ includes allys and we’re lucky to have you if you’ll still stay.
how did trauma give you dysphoria?
Please stay in some capacity, what you’ve been through could really help someone. I might be in a similar position as you, I’m right on the fence about transitioning and what you’ve just said might apply to me. So please hang around, it could save someone. 💖🥰
Once lgbt always lgbt Dosent mean you actively take part but it has been a part of your life and you’ll always have a loving community too talk too if you ever need. Godspeed my friend, Godspeed
Just saying, that the only prerequisite to being trans is to think you’re trans. It doesn’t matter where you *think* your dysphoria comes from as long as you’re living the life that brings you happiness. In any case, wishing you healing ❤️‍🩹
Fair winds...
Good for you :D
I recently came across r/detrans. The experiences of people there might resonate with you. Take care, OP!
dude really notified us of his absence
Yk you don't have to leave, you could still stay just as an ally
Thank you. I'm actually going through therapy right now in order to make that a reality.
Freaking true! Proud of it too, as the community has kept me sane and alive while I sort myself out.
Agreed. Though I will admit, I was not expecting that this was the path that I would take. But I am not going to complain, as it makes this moment even more special.
Don't worry, I'll still make sure to fight against white supremacy and transphobia wherever I go. It is just that I need to separate myself from the trans community in hope of figuring out what it means to be a cisgender man and most importantly a cis ally to you all. 

I had basically spent too long ingraining myself to this wonderful community that I had lost sight of what it means to see myself as a separate person from everyone else in the society I live in. Thus I just want to spend some time alone to gather my thoughts and prepare for my new life ahead.
by the way cis isn’t an acronym, it’s from a made-up language called latin
Allies aren’t part of the community though, they’re allies *of* the community
Oh, you really think so? Here I was feeling shame over realizing that I am not actually queer, as I had built my entire life to be that up to this point.
LOL! Don't worry. I learned that the 2in1 shampoo and conditioner and other variations are trash. So I am definitely going to wash my hair with separate bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash from now on.

Healthy hair and skin is better than brittle hair and dry skin any day.
I'm trans and I use 2in1 shampoo QwQ (I have bad dandruff so I use Head and Shoulders lmao)
If I had any coins, you would surely get an award for this comment. 💕
One time at a friend's house party I met a girl that had the most beautiful long thick, straight, shiny hair. Her hair looked like the models in the hair commercials. Of course I asked what she used to wash her hair expecting a long list of the most expensive hair products. Her answer? Pert Plus. LOL. I've been using Pert Plus since then, and I've gotta say, it's made my hair look much nicer than it ever did before. Though I still use a L'Occitane body wash :D
I was under the assumption that since I no longer identify as queer, I should step aside and let the queer community speak for themselves. I've seen far too many times when a cisgender person, much less a cishet person, tries to speak about the queer experience only to end up damaging the already strained relationship that the queer community has with the rest of society. So I just want to be respectful and not get in the way of progress when you definitely deserve better.
You are most certainly welcome. Oh, and if you encounter any transphobic person trying to twist my words into another transphobic attack, please remind them that I am a proud ally of the trans community and that there was no way in hell that I was ""mislead"" into thinking that I was trans for a while.

Or even better, tell them that I have no regrets over exploring my gender identity. Because I really don't, as it had allowed me to grow into a much more confident and kind man that sees the importance of allowing people to be their true selves.
I'll be sure to check by from time to time. I just need a breather from the chaos that is going on right now.
I agree with this and I’ll add that hopefully the realization of it being solely a trauma response wasn’t guided by others who have less than good intentions towards the trans community.
Thank you. I wish the same for you too, friend.
Thank you! I wish the same for you.
I'm certainly working on it. I am already seeing a therapist to help me go through it.
Thank you!
For sure! I will always be an ally too, as I now know how much it sucks to deal with gender dysphoria.
LOL! Nice. It is definitely going into my playlist now.
Oh for sure! If I ever fall in love with a trans woman, you can bet that I will be the most doting and validating boyfriend that I can be. I'll give her all the pillows and Blahajs she wants so she can be the ultimate pillow princess... No. A pillow QUEEN!
Years of therapy and self-reflection for the most part. Also letting go of your self-hatred helps a lot too.
True enough. I do got that.
Relax. Take a deep breath and then let it out. There is nothing to worry about. What works for me doesn't mean that it will work for you. But if it helps, try finding a gender affirming therapist to talk about it. They are much more qualified in helping you sort everything out than I do.
-----------   Trigger warning: Abuse     ---------------------




|| I was abused as a child by my parents. They shamed and mock me for everything that I did, only to isolate me and psychologically torment me for going against their command no matter if it is real or imaginary. They gaslight me into thinking that who I am and what I was doing was wrong and that it would only make me end up on the streets with no help or comfort in sight. Even when I was doing normal stuff a person my own age was doing, they would find a way to twist it into a message about how immature and naive I was to do so. So as a result I learned to despise everything that I am, including hating my body and my gender because I wrongly thought that the reason why my parents (and by extension, the society that I lived in) had hated me so much was because I was the oldest son in the family and that it would have been easier if I was born as a woman. ||

Hope that helps.
I'll stop by from time to time. I just need some time to figure myself out now, as I still have lasting effects of the trauma that I have to contend with atm.
Thank you! It was a difficult journey indeed.
Thank you for your kind words. I really hope so too.

Btw, Happy Cake Day!
I wrote this out on another thread in this post, so I will just copy and paste it here. Just be warned that it is distressing as it talks about abuse.

I'll think about it. I'm kind of preoccupied with other things right now tho.
That subreddit has actually been taken control by terfs/transphobes. You really shouldn't go there unless you want to see how vile terfs really are.
bad sub, think there is a different one that isnt as cringe.
Awesome! I know from my short experience with therapy that it’s nice to just talk about how you feel and then start working to make the negative into a positive.
That's totally valid.  I hope maybe at some point you can reengage after your more sure of your place.  

I also hope that if you feel after some distance maybe it wasn't the right call, don't feel like it would be a problem to come back and again seek help.  I can't speak for everyone but I know I've waffled back and forth a few times on the path to accepting myself (And I'm probably still not done)

I truly wish you well and hope to bump into you out there. :-)
I think I get what your saying, he isn't a part of the trans community because he isn't trans, but I think what others were saying is that they can still vibe in r/trans the subreddit and be a part of this community, despite not being trans
The community is in this case the subreddit. Why would a cis person not be allowed to interact with/be a part of r/trans?
Respectfully, but strongly, disagree.
Lots of us had build our entire life around being cis. Doesn't mean we should be ashamed of that, just like you shouldn't be ashamed either.
You thought you might be, you explored it, you realised you're not. It's not a big deal or anything to be ashamed of; people grow and change and develop themselves as they live, it's natural.
The queer community can sometimes be a little heavy-handed in pushing the idea that a person who is questioning must be queer. I would say that, similar to the way most cis people don't question their gender and most straight people don't question their sexuality, most queer people don't fully consider if it is a fully internal thing for them or if they're being influenced by outside sources, like a childhood trauma.

That being said, life is a journey, it's not about where you end up as much as it is how you get there. You have unlocked more about your past and now understand more about yourself than most people will. There's no shame in realizing you're not queer, there's no shame in realizing you are queer. It's just self-discovery and that is a powerful thing that no one can take from you and shows a massive amount of introspection into the way you were, the way you were brought up, and the way you are and the way you interact with others today.
I wish more people would explore their gender. I celebrate your for going through that exploration and finding yourself. That's what its all about, discovering and embracing yourself and it looks like you've done that <3
If every man could learn this lesson, the world would be a better place. Congrats on your journey, and much love! 💖
Same but I use 3 in 1 lol
You've gone through gender dysphoria and figured out it wasn't because you wanted to be the opposite gender, but early trauma. You're not alone in that and I think that experience can be of value for some people that aren't sure wheter or not they're trans.
Unfathomably Based 😎👌
OP said in another comment that they came to that conclusion themselves
That’s a good step!
If I didn’t already have an amazing boyfriend, I’d be hitting on you right now :P
Ty lol
Thanks for sharing. So happy for you that you’re working through all of that!
ty!!
thanks. did you come to this conclusion yourself?
No problem, I’d just like to say thank you for your input. 💖
Oh good to know. That's sad because if it were sincere, it would be such a great space for questioning people to access!
What's the less-cringe sub?
I'll be sure to keep that in mind. Thanks.
Exactly that yes. More people in these subs is always great, especially someone who has experienced gender in a way that isn’t stereotypically cisheteronormative, but that doesn’t mean they’re part of the community at large
That’s not even remotely what I’m saying, I’m saying cishet allies are not part of the community. The subreddit is fine and welcome to all obviously
It doesn’t matter if you agree or not, you’re just plain wrong.
Literally this. My entire life was built around being a cishet white man, and casting any thoughts to the contrary aside as shameful dreams and wishes. Turns out I’m much happier now lol, I’m glad he figured himself out :) we all deserve that in the end, and to be allowed to be ourselves without feeling like we shouldn’t or can’t for reasons A, B, or C.
Tbf, I am still dealing with the aftereffects from the trauma that my parents inflicted upon me. They made me despise every aspect of who I am inside, only to then shame me for even questioning and exploring my identity. So it is still a struggle for me to acknowledge that I did nothing wrong by going the direction I did, even if it lead me back to being a cishet man. 

But I am thankful that I did go down this path and learn what the queer experience is all about. I do not ever want to forget that experience for as long as I live.
I will think about that. But for right now, I just want to work on myself and move past the trauma.
Me too.
Yes I did. I wasn't forced to make that decision by anyone but myself. I had even distanced myself from the toxic people of my life for a while by the time I came to it. So this is truly coming from my heart and soul.
Yeah. It pisses me off too as I would have loved it if such a genuine place exist. But alas, it is not the case.
I think its called real detrans or something like that.

Edit: hit me as soon as a pressed send - its actualdetrans
I'm comfortable with my position.  And judging by the votes the wider community would seem to agree.  I don't know what your so mad about, but I do wish you well.
Interesting story. Thank you for sharing. Wishing you good luck on your continued healing :)

If you feel comfortable sharing, was there a specific moment or thought where it ""clicked"" where you realized ""Ah hah, i'm not actually trans, it's just Trauma #2341""?"	wkwemz	trans	3374	0.95	2022-08-10 12:39:54
Wholesome supportive friend		"They never believe in the beginning🥺😰
That guy's face makes him look transphobic. I must be reading that wrong.
I prefer this version (and I don't think I even need to read the original to know I prefer this version).

Edit: I've been told the original isn't bad like I feared. :)
This is more funnier than it intended to be 😂 cute ending tho
Im not in school anymore, but it would be interesting to ask a friend to purposely bully you with ""affirming"" gender comments, when you're not passing yet. So all the other kids will finally call you those names too. But little do they know, its your identity. We are outsmarting the real bullies here.
I do love support through teasing.
The good ending
Having support from another would be awesome.
The good ending
It's not a ""girl bike"" the center bar is straight across. On girl bikes it dips down.

The only thing ""girl"" about it is that it's pink.
This reminds me of a regular at work, he's always coming in and saying I look cute with my long silky hair, but little does he know.. 😂

I like to joke with him and be like ""Why thank you! Sometimes I like to feel pretty too you know"" and he always gets a chuckle out of it!
Lucky bastard, she gets to take hormones while I can’t even get blockers
Is this legal to starting HRT before 18?
Fun fact: she had him moaning like a good boy later that night 🤣 we love a supportive king.
Repost
A based friend.
lmao
This my goals of life
I must be a negative person bc it looks like hes mocking her to me, but i understand how its supposer to be interpreted
i love that
BFF’s
I like how she does the Dreams Works face 24/7
My friends just say “nice tits” 

It’s funny and supportive
The best revenge on those who scoff and hate and point is to live your best life, achieve your goals, and show them your tenacity to never give up on yourself!
Look at the text at the start compared to the later on text. Its been altered
I think thats the joke. At first it looks like he’s teasing but in the end you see he’s supportive
I think the original was supposed to be the guy being transphobic and at the end he didnt know it was the same person (not 100% sure it was the original but I do remember one like this)
I think it’s a bonehurtimgjuice
You're not reading it wrong, the last panel's dialogue was changed to be more wholesome lolol. Pretty sure it was originally him being shocked and finding her attractive, but in this case it was changed to sexualize her less.
its an edit of the original. so you're reading the guy character correctly.
The only thing different in the original is that in the last panel he just says “nice” and she doesn’t say anything, thankfully the original is not transphobic
""more funnier"" is linguistically redundant
I had this happen in school accidentally. My bullies started calling me queer as an insult, and a lot of the other kids started doing it, too.

They thought that they were being hurtful, but it was actually one of the best parts of my day.
Any kind of support is welcome
there's a unified design philosophy across bikes made for small children? and it's this specific?!
the glittery streamers and the basket are usually found on “girl bikes”.

which is dumb imo, where are boys supposed to store shit??
Only in some countries
As far as I know, you have puberty blockers to delay your puberty, and then you start HRT later when you're older and able to make judgement.
So?
Edit: I'd heard this a few times... so I looked it up. And I was right. Someone said this much more succinctly: ""Living well is the best revenge"" -George Herbert
Fuck yeah! 🌟
It's an edit, the original comic had a different punchline I think
I think it’s the pack of commas that does it for me. “Nice, girl [anything]” sounds a lot more supportive in the “wow that’s nifty” kind of way
Thank you for that. :)

I was concerned the original was either transphobic or him unduly sexualising her.
If you're gonna nitpick strangers' grammar, then you should at least use correct capitalization and punctuation. :)
if it's redundant then why did the author say it anyway? because it was the simplest word to express a stronger form of the word ""funnier"". In another language, they might have doubled the word instead (""funnier funnier"") instead of using the word ""more"". Both uses are ""redundant"", but still useful for expressing one's thoughts.
It’s more funnier that way
You’re redundant
ur linguistically redundant aye goteem
Afaik, the dip is there to accomodate skirts and dresses, so it could more accurately be called a ""skirt bike""
Yea, it's kinda fucked up when you think about it.

Have you tried finding pockets on women's clothing?? Lol even my work shirts have pockets for guys but jone for girls. It's infuriating.
No, we don't.
Though the original punchline is just ""Nice."", implying that he finds her very attractive, so... Somewhat decent?
Yeah the bottom panels font is different
It's more incorrecter

Yes, it is :) [Here](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.Knd0QwAwBpj_x_LLW_zQlQHaVt%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=ec96b2364a21c5c871cf5ffc08bd335aa0799069a5f1930e84bcbf8756720261&ipo=images) is the original!

I wonder what to do with my daughter who's still with my parents and I have since found their allegations against me false according to a specialist alcohol, drug and mental health psychiatrist, said I had nothing wrong with me, the ones with issues are my parents and the judge who allowed the allegations to stand in family court
Oh god. 

This meme is too real.

Holy shit. I'm dead.
""She uses he/they pronouns""🤪🤪
A week before my first visit to my parents presenting as my real self.

We'll try our best to use your new name and pronouns but we'll likely make a few mistakes.

Within 5 minus of arriving in deadnamed 4 times without any attempt to correct themselves. 😔
my dad says he supports me and he’ll try to understand 


weeks after i came out to him he’s still calling me by my deadname, when he doesn’t he calls me by my nickname rather than my real name and uses he/him pronouns etc
hello yes my entire family is in this meme
same.
""Yes, I support you!""
meanwhile, the next sentence:
""Hey [Deadname]""
Fr my family act like they’ll support me but just ignore that I’m trans. Esp my mom who acts like she’d be supportive and then turns around and not only pretends I’m not trans but is transphobic towards me as well :/
My mom has constantly responded everytime I correct her or get upset for the past five years with this: 

""baby, I promise I'm trying. It's just really hard for me.""

Like it's been half a decade and you don't even call me by my name unless you're drunk
My brothers to me lmao (except one)
My mum says she won’t call me by my name because it’s the name my sisters dad wanted my sister to be called and honestly don’t see how it plays a part in being who I am. So freaking annoying
This reminds me of my brother. He was the person I trusted most and after a large amount of pain, deliberating and stress I decided to open up to him. He was…accepting. Kind of.  It was awkward, but I figured that was just the situation in general. Over the next few months, I start slowly opening up to him about things. Nothing major, but little things like how I used to wonder what it would be like to be a girl when I was younger. Sometimes it would be prompted by me, sometimes by him. Fast forward a few months; I’ve seen a doctor and a gender therapist. I’m unsure about transitioning medically, and that has put me on a *looooong* waiting list for therapy. I’m with my brother and we are having a fairly honest discussion. At this point I bring up the topic of pronouns and something I want to try out. He goes on a rant about how there is a deeper underlying problem, and I specifically remember him saying “first it was your sexuality, then it was politics (I was fairly active in attending Socialist Party meetups when I was younger), now it’s your gender. I’m not saying you’re hopping on a bandwagon, but this is very sudden. I don’t think you’re trans, but I’ll support you. I think you need to look into yourself though. Being trans just feels like an excuse. What is it you don’t like about yourself? Because it’s something. You’re trying to label yourself and fit into different groups. That’s not the answer. Like I said I’ll support you if you want to go through with this, but I just don’t want you making a mistake.”

I hate the feeling I had while he said that stuff. Unfortunately, I’ve had that feeling before. But this time, it stung. It really stung. But, it’s helped me close off emotionally again. So at least some good come out of it haha
Or they hit you with the ""but I've known you so long as deadname but I'll try"" then proceeds to misgendered you and dead name you. For context I've know this person for 5 years but my sister brother and the rest of my family has known me my whole life and they only slipped a few times the first few weeks. I've been out since the beginning of June :>
ahhhh martina hill, what a funny sketch that was, way to awesome 😄😄😄. op did you made this by yourself?

Edith search martina hill chilli or knallerfrauen vorsicht scharf thats a skatch from a german comedy show.
Been experiencing this at work
I did this to myself so many times lol, I love spicy food I'm cutting something and then rub my eye smh. I don't find spicy food that spicy anymore at least for the type I'm eating I guess that's why I keep forgetting 💀
You didn't have to hurt me this hard!

lol, I laughed so I wouldn't cry.
I know this pain far too well, not the eye pain, the other thing
I know, my mom will tell me ""of course i support you"" 

I turn the corner not even leave yet ""yeah deadname was here, he (not she) blah blah""
Happened with a friend of mine almost right after I came out, it really sucks
My mom hates my name and only when she really wants something will use it. Uses my old name exclusively beside that and literally invents words instead of calling me her daughter or using she/her. 



My wife also only uses my name when wants something or sees that I’m upset. Neither want me to come out to family or the kids…so meanwhile my 9yo son is like “hey dad you want to be a girl don’t you.”



It’s a damn good thing I have supportive, affirming friends.
This exact comic has happened to me before. And also not to mention how relateable the title is too 🥲
“I support you!”

Two weeks later: “don’t you think that outfit is a little too girly for a ‘boy’? Don’t get me wrong, I know it’s not safe for you to transition in your home, but how can you call yourself a guy if you don’t even own a binder yet?”
“i love that name, top 3 names honestly”

*proceeds to never use said name*
My brother. The dude knows I'm Trans, he was the first family member I told. He's seen my progression on Twitter and even when I left home and come back to keep the peace with my family, he still deadnames me. 

I get that it's not an easy adjustment but fucking hell, put some goddamn effort into it.
I understood the *template*. It’s Chili. Never. Touch. Your. Eyes. After. Handling. Chili.
My mom told me that she would support me if i ever come out as trans.

I told her that I wanted a girl's name

She got mad at me
oh yes this is my mother, where did u get this pic of us
""I don't really support trans people, but I'm fine with their existence"" 🙁🙁🙁
This is so true for me. Ever since I changed my name.

“I’ll call you by your new name and respect your pronouns.”
*The next day….*

“This is my friend. **HIS** name is Neon”
Me: fucking really?
This person didn't say they'd support me, but post op hysterectomy one of the nurses misgendered the hell outta me. I'd correct her and say ""It's they, not she"" and she just turned back to my partner and said ""Well **she**....”. Seriously? It's been a whole 1.2 seconds. And I couldn't ask for a new nurse because I was the only patient left in recovery and she was the only nurse left. Yeah...not fun.
My mom was ‘hurt’ that I called my birth name my deadname. You named me after an ex boyfriend, ffs
I understood this reference.
The world doesn't revolve around you
I have family just like this. they act all supportive until they show their true colors and you find out for sure that they aren't all allyship as they claim
Mom: *calls me by my preferred name. *


 *ten minutes into the conversation later. * 


Mom"" ""I raised a boy not an it if you like guys only that's fine, but it's still a sin before God because I may be calling you by your preferred name but I still see you as a man and men shall not lay with men.""

 Me: *Quietly banging my head into the dashboard as I try to blank myself out of the conversation waiting on a text to my friend for help out of the conversation. * 

Mom""""oh honey why are you crying "" 


me: ""because your words and only your words about my gender hurt me everyone else can say what they want and I can tell them off"" 

Mom: but honey how come you're hurting I'm not hurting you I'm telling the truth *this reason due to other situations in my life secretly being why I'm too blunt with people instead of having more tact on how to not be as blunt. *


Me: ""because what you are saying isnt true, it's not a sin before God, God taught to love others and not judge people for who they are inside or out, to love them unconditionally without separating them from who they are in God's name, judging them saying you're a man, saying it's a choice, saying I don't condone it and neither does god thus putting words in his mouth"" 


Mom: I don't want to talk about this subject *her secretly knowing I've backed her into a biblical corner of her trying to act like God's mouth piece. *


Me: ""why is it that when I make a point you stop wanting to talk""


Mom: ""because this conversation is hurting my feelings""



Me: (and who's been talking down to me telling me what God says this contradicting his teachings by judging and hurting feelings in the first place when being trans has nothing against it in the bible and her only argument is that since she sees me as a man and it being a sin before God for me to let me rail the everliving crap out of me)



Mom: ""honey can you please answer me please you're too quiet I'm worried""



Me: it's nothing mom *slumps over as she goes to pat me on the back making me flinch. *


Mom: "" why are you flinching?""



Me: * having been beaten and abused by several women while trying to be what my mother would call straight being unable to stay hard for any of them being with them solely for my mother's benefit not my own so I tell her. *


Me: it's because my ex used to beat me....*only wanting her to know the minimal amount of abuse I've been through as to keep her safe from blaming herself. *


The lady behind us eaves dropping from the car parked behind ours as she's getting in: ""oh so she's a bitch that's why she's crying"" *this being the highlight of the argument with my mother no matter how unrelated or insulting most would think it is. *



Me: ""mom I'll talk to you later ok I love you"" *slinks out of the car depressed. *


Mom: ""ok sweetheart have a good rest of your day I love you"" 


Me: ""I love you too mom I'll talk to you later""


Mom: ""I'll see ya honey, goodbye""


Me: ""bye mom I love you""


Also me: *quietly shuffles into my apartment until no one can see me closing the door and breaking into tears sobbing into the floor curled up into a ball. * 



*Me being a 29 year old woman almost thirty. *
Gotta admit this is pretty accurate for me, but I'm the one accidentally rubbing the chili in their eyes... My sibling changed to gender neutral pronouns a while ago and I'm pretty sure I keep saying she/her by accident, I didn't think it'd be this hard to change the way I refer to someone.
Drunkenly came out to my family last night mom introduces me at the store today as her boy 
me: 😮 

now I didn’t take offense because I drunkenly told her I can always be her son and I’ve not started transitioning yet
I love spy x family!
Ahh this is what I go through, I'm to scared to correct my parents
my mum tbh
friend: alright i’ll support you :)

same friend: *never uses my actual name and pronouns*

**edit** not to mention that the same friend fucking out*ED ME TO A FUCKING TEACHER THAT I PURPOSELY DIDNT COME OUT TO* im seriously considering dropping her as a friend if this continues n she still doesn’t ducking correct herself
this is like, every interaction with my mom i’ve had in my life lmfao. then the troglodyte has there nerve to tell me she loves me
I told my family my first choice of a new name and they all made fun of it

I picked a new one I liked more and didn't tell them until it was legally changed like 6 months later. Get rekt fuckers you can't discourage me when it's already my legal name
Yikes... I feel this way too hard. Don't let our shitty parents dictate how we feel.
This just hit me in the chest. I went thru something similar yesterday with mine, put me on a binge today. Very not good...
I'm sorry...I feel you because that's how my mom is.
My dad does this but gets my pronouns wrong. He normally says ""this is my son Stephanie"" I know he's not trying because he still calls me my old name when talking to family... My other family mocks him for it and all just sucks.
His pronouns are she/her 🥲
😳

Wut
This is very important and im so sorry you are going through this. but i have to ask, how does this have relevance to the meme?
I’m not 100% sure those 3 paragraphs are related. Some shit just went down in a very peculiar sequence of events.
Unfortunately some people see someone going through self discovery as threatening. The idea that 'you don't like yourself' is used as a backing for keeping people in the status quo. They don't realize the self discovery process/self acceptance is the cure (and often have a vision of what they believe would ""fix"" you that does not line up with what you need.) It may seem sudden to him but it's been all aligned with what you've been working through from the sounds of things.
Ughhhh I hate the whole ""you've been influenced"" thing
I got somewhat the same reaction from my mom but she didn't support at all. in fact she won't even help me go pick up my estrogen when I don't drive and any related medication. She tells me the guy I was with that I was the one that said yes to him fucking me when he asked if I'd ever thought about it. (meanwhile me having been wishing I could have been born female so I could be with him the way I wanted, instead having been stuck with this ludicrous, floppy, abnormal, weird appendage I've hated since the 4th grade, I tried to destroy it myself with a steel poll bashing on it, so many times over the years trying to break it so they'd have a reason they could be ok with for removing the thing. I thought he'd like that more too. being heavily dysphoric i agreed anyways to anal which I thoroughly enjoyed.) so I agreed to sex and now my mom says he'd perverted me into liking men. when I've wanted a man in my life ever since I had a crush on a guy named Emerson in the 6th grade, before I'd ever even had sex. I knew I wanted one before that but wasn't old enough to get one, ""but hey this is so sudden let's talk and think about it for a sec, you know the truth right?"". but yeah let's just let you assume it's not what I'm telling you and act like a royal behind not only behind my back but here have some misgendering and public announcing that I'm her son in the store when we are shopping, to her friends she sees there.
I did not create this, it just frames a perfect image of unsupportive ""allies"".
That's what I'll do with my new name, I'm so done being dead named. Congrats on your new name
same with my first name! granted it didn’t really suit me, but i was trying it and they gave me so much shit for it. made fun of me and it’s not like they were offering any alternatives. changed my name, didn’t tell them till they found out on their own, made fun of it, threatened to name our new cat my name so I couldn’t keep my name??? like they didn’t thank god, and it’s still my name today (evan), but god I can’t wait to get away from them
And you know the worst part all I ever wanted was someone who's on my side in life
This kinda stuff really annoys me, like you're *so* close to getting it right
I heard this one a couple days ago. A cis girl overhead me talking about LGBT stuff with the only other queer kid in my school and thought to show how much of an ally she was.. 

“I have a non-binary brother! His pronouns are they/them. 😊😊”

My parents aren't supportive and looking back never have been, they have my daughter due to a family court ruling and now have ceased all contact between her and I due to me being trans using false allegations to get the ruling they wanted, as far as I know I'm not the only trans person in this position with regard to false allegations in the family court
Just my parents being unsupportive despite saying they have been in their past, why cease all contact between parent and child if you're supposed to be supportive?
Haha. Just my reaction to it.
Not blaming you, but whoever made it just edited over the original clip. I'm guessing the anime characters pictured are some kind of meme within a meme thing.

Any honestly, anything Martina Hill is great to watch. It's all in German, but the comedy is mostly physical, so it works.
The fuck

Yeah hope you can get away from that garbage asap, I'm fortunate that I live on my own so I can just completely ignore them if they go too far
Oh no! Now I'm crying again. 

Dammit... 😭
Ya trying my best with my SO
Fuck I’ll settle for being on my own side
That's majorly fucked up, almost to the point where I would consider talking to some public media about it or something. Don't know if it would go anywhere but..
ah i see, im so sorry. you deserve so much better
Ah, a zombie!!

Huh. Zombies can type. Hollywood and comics and that weirdo at the end of my street all lied to me. Again. Now I’m starting to doubt if fizzy cola bottle sweets *really* contain the exact same ingredients as the drinks…
I accepted that a long time ago but it'd be nice not to have to fight every doctor I meet trying to get access to IVF and later on to Metoidioplasty you know
Seriously want to but yeah, not exactly sure who would write about it, sadly a common occurrence in family court
It'll all work out in the end, my dad has unresolved trauma from when he is a kid, I have a feeling both my parents are trans tbh, my mum is butch and my dad is femme and whenever I have brought up him being trans he's vehemently denied it straight away, neighbours and friends of theirs have said to me on multiple occasions that they can't talk with my dad due to a block being there within him
Remember cis people can also present butch and femme, and that's fine also. And them being able to express themselves without stigma would make everyone a lot happier.
That is true for sure, my mum did allude to wanting to be a boy early in life, dad though has too much of a trauma brick wall up to be able to get anything out of him, as for how he is, femme...and he has issues being around gay and trans people (has also teased me for being drawn to gender non conforming people  before i came out which is also what delayed me coming out)"	xo16mz	trans	3023	0.98	2022-09-25 22:32:26
