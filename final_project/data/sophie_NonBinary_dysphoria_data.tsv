A comic about my own Gender Dysphoria (TW). Hope it resonates with someone ❤️		"Very well made. Do you want to talk about your dysphoria? I am here to listen :)
This means more to me than u can know! Thank you for sharing 🥰
*angry dysphoria noises*
I can relate with this too hard. Going through a lot with my amab body right now
Your comics are so sweet, and for what it’s worth, I don’t think anyone sees you as critically as you see yourself. At least not here :) keep being you 💛
:<

Thank you for posting this, but also damn this made me sad.
Wow this made me cry.  Thanks for sharing it hits home.
Saw myself in this, thank you for sharing
Lowkey made me tear up
This resonates… way to much with me.
What a beautiful way to express yourself, there’s loads of mtf people out there who feel exactly like that, (myself being one of them). Well done! 😘
I feel like the odd person out with comics like these. I don't have dysphoria so much as I just don't feel attached to myself. Just an odd ""yeah that's me"" and a weird hatred that things I enjoy aren't made for me or in a me size.
This is very relatable. My body hair basically starts to come back the day after I shave it, face usually waits a full 24hours at least. It makes me so sad and dysphoric :(
I feel this so much 💖
Ahhh, yeah, I can relate. I hate shaving so, so much more than I hate my facial and body hair - but now I’m facing my dysphoria instead of hiding it I just can’t let it grow. A good hot shower is my favourite way to distract from the pain, I hope HRT starts reducing how much I need to shave. That, or I’ll just have to save up for a *lot* of electrolysis. 

It’s weird though, none of my recent partners did much about their body hair. I don’t know why my own bothers me so much when I didn’t care about theirs at all.
I feel you, except afab. I wish I could just transform sometimes, don’t you?
This resonates a little well rn
Damn this is beautiful in a sad way
I can relate to this.
This does resonate with me, I was born at 25 weeks gestation in 1982, always liked saunas,  steam rooms as well as hot showers for my lungs, now I look back and it was also to try and open things up, to get rid of the imbalance which was testosterone in my system that caused issues with my body (night sweats, hot flashes, apnea and depression) from age 6/7 or so, 

Since starting hrt I don't need the shower that hot and all the menopausal symptoms have gone as well as my past 22 year want for booze pot and tobacco have disappeared too
This really resonates with me, it’s so awesome that you shared this because it really helps me (and hopefully others) feel much less alone. hugs 💜
Totally relatable. As a former male, I'm so sick of feeling and looking masculine.
This is honestly super beautiful. I’ve been heavily struggling to listen and hear myself on where I stand with my gender identity and reading this resonated so well for me that I know the steps I’m taking are the right ones
Can u be non-binary if u don't have gender dysphoria. I'm not sure. Help
I feel this.
This is really beautiful but also I like the implication that trans women have a dangerous feminine energy constantly trying to emerge from the human shell. You goddesses scare me sometimes. 

have some affirmation: she, her, girl, woman, women, girlypop, feminine, sis
Epilate! 
And yeah, thousands of dollars and years later & still need to shave facial hair daily.
To have ask the questions: it's pretty common for Dysphoric people, whatever their AGAB or their gender to have this habit,

If the person also do self harm it's not always a good idea though as the line between too hot and a real burn is close .

(Talking from experience)
I love this and I completely relate its insane
That’s how I feel so much
Seeing this coming out of the shower myself hits too hard
F-Word. This is resonating with me.
Fuck…this hurts because it’s so true
Fuuuuuuuuuuck me this hits way too close
Relatable but I have it the opposite way around.
Are you in my brain? This is so me.
God this is how I feel every day.
I felt that..
That hit me hard. Thanks for this 💛
OMFG this hits me so deeply 😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️
Thank you for this. It's exactly what I needed as a reminder I'm not alone in this.
Relatable as fuck.
I used to love baths because of the warmth and quiet. Now that I stopped ignoring my feelings my dysphoria is raging and is the worst in showers, I feel like my comfort was stolen from me by it. :(
I relate to this a lot despite being transmasc, your not alone, hopefully we will both be happy one day :)
Yep me too this resonates alot 💜
I feel this but I'm also confused about my body like I'm AFAB but feel more masculine like my face looks more masculine my voice in my opinion is masculine. There's times I feel masculine af then other days i feel feminine and it's just all confusing
Fuck I love this. I have to shave my face everyday and still have stubble :(
This is beautiful but also so deeply relatable. I'm AFAB and some days the dysphoria is so bad I see myself and want to puke. Just a deep feeling of... wrongness.
Beautiful comic and beautiful message. Thank you
Hey that's me. That's litterally me...
Thank you for this comic now I can use it to explain to my psychologist how I feel
i feel this but for my femininity (so basically the opposite)
I was 5 or 6 when I my thought of not wanting body hair popped in my head. Being AMAB, I have accepted defeat.
That's sad but... poetic. I feel you though, hang in there sis.
If I (amab) could choose, I would have no breasts, but feminine curves and no body hair. This is pretty much impossible, (expect maybe some laser hair removal stuff) but I guess I’ll just stick to regular shaving
Wow, what a beautiful comic. I half relate, half don’t. Instead of shaving my chest I’m holding it flat or covering it or trying to make it look masculine somehow. I’ve always showered with my arms across my chest for as long as I can remember.
I feel you. Just want to be free from the chains of gender
damn kinda reminds me of myself
fuck i relate so much, but its the other way around   
kinda makes me teary
I can connect with that, my parents question on why I want to shave my body hair and facial hair because a man must be that way. Lucky I convince them but I really want my body hair to go away. I also trying skin cream   and find it very pleasant for me. Hopefully when I out of my parents house I can finally do these things freely.
I can relate to this, even though I'm  afab trans and GQ. Testosterone caused great things but also gave me way more body hair that I'm self conscious about and is hell to shave/wax. I try to remind myself that our ancestors all used to be hairy af, even the females.
I have a lot of scars in my legs, in my neck and my face, thanks all the gods in don't have chest hair because they would be awful. I want to start HRT as soon as possible to thin my body hair.
Thank you for making and sharing this. I've been working with trying to make heads and tails of my dysphoria, and I've really strived with how to explain it, and it's just refreshing to see those feels in print.
Razor bumps are the worst :( Something that might help is waxing. You can get home kits pretty cheap and if that worries you, there’s the natural alternative called sugaring. It’s also an exfoliant. Wishing you the best and sending you love ♥️
This was an immediate save as it describes exactly how I feel. Thank you so much as I wasn't able to put this into words before
Thanks for sharing this. Yesterday today I've been feeling this SUPER hard.
Noo don't burn yourself you'll get infected
Omg- that hit different bro…
Nair works great for razor bumps
I found Nair works well to remove hair without leaving razor bumps, You just put it on like a lotion let it sit and then scrub with a loofa in the shower
Ouch ouch oof :(
Know the feeling. Love to have bigger Breasts
This is beautiful. TBH I've never done this with dysphoria, but I have done *literally the same thing* with the parts of my body that were giving me chronic pain (now thankfully resolved).
Maybe not fully resonating, but this definitely finds something close to a harmonic frequency some of the time.
Cis guy here, I can actually kind of relate to this in regards to hair and curves in places. Like, I go through the motions of exercising and shaving but I know that I can't change those things about myself which bothers me at times.
Thank you! I actually made this comic a few months ago and I’m feeling a lot better about my body now 😊 thought I’d share in case anyone else can relate to it!
So glad it connected with you ❤️😊
Thank you ❤️❤️
I’m so sorry! Don’t be sad :0 If it helps I’m feeling much more gender euphoric and happy with my body now! I hope you’re in a good place too!
That means a lot! Thanks so much ❤️❤️❤️
Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.

I have checked 1,011,745,721 comments, and only 200,827 of them were in alphabetical order.
Thank you SO much! I’m very glad it resonates with you 😊
I’m glad you don’t have to deal with dysphoria so much! I have several non-binary friends who don’t deal with dysphoria, and it’s totally valid too! Just sharing my own personal experience!
Same, usually I'm just living in a state of Depersonalisation, just very rarely do I have like, active discomfort
Black hair on white skin! It feels smooth but I can still see it all!
Thanks for sharing your experience! 
Body hair’s a pain. And also same! I don’t care about body hair on a partner... kinda funny. may we someday have the same grace for our own bodies as we do for others’ ❤️
There's so many tips and tricks for shaving that should make it a lot less painful. I have really sensitive skin and now even I don't get any pain from it. I can share some info if you want?
If only!
I’m so glad it made you feel seen ❤️ this comic has served it’s purpose 😊
This means a lot to read!! I’m so glad this comic made a difference in affirming your own personal journey 🥰
Absolutely!! I have a few non-binary friends who don’t experience gender dysphoria, and it’s a wonderful thing if you don’t have that. It’s so valid to be comfortable in your skin and body, and still exist outside the gender binary!
Yes, I would never condone self harm!! It was more metaphorical than literal.
I’m so glad ❤️
I’m so sorry you’re going through that. I hope you can feel reconnected with your body and enjoy those experiences again someday ❤️
I made this comic a few months ago and I’m a lot happier with my body now! :)
I’m so sorry you have to deal with that :( I hope you can find ways to become more comfortable with your body!
❤️ Thanks for the kind words!
I’m so glad! 😊
Thank you for sharing ❤️ gender dysphoria sucks in whatever form it takes...
❤️❤️❤️ You’re so welcome!!
Thank you! I’ll definitely look into those options! Tbh I have pretty sensitive skin which is why I’ve been hesitant to try them out, but I think it’ll be worth it to at least try!
❤️ Glad it captured your experience!!
Glad it connected with you 💜
Totally, I would never actually burn myself for real.! Just want to make it clear that this was more metaphorical!
I am glad to hear you are feeling better! I can somewhat relate but I kinda have the opposite problem. Can't wait for top surgery...
so glad you're feeling better.
As a I! Trust me this was something I needed to read growing up. Sorry for earlier reply, I was commenting on something else I saw. All seriousness though, it definitely brightened my day that u were able illustrate this perfectly!
Thank you. I too have been feeling more comfortable with my body over time. I honestly consider my body rather perfect. But the body hair is hell. I'll definitely try to find a way to get rid of it as long as possible. Hopefully indefinitely.
It certainly does! 😘
I get ya. I guess I can be counted as lucky. 

Won't deny as someone who shaves...10/10 would love a permanent option that could be easily done though!
I have been reading a lot about absurdist philosophy lately, it’s definitely helped me come to terms with glaring contradictions like that! But you’re right, the journey is about coming to love ourselves, and I hope that happens for you sooner than you dare hope ❤️
That would be lovely, thank you!
The dream 😔
I don't even know what I am yet. Why is it so confusing.
I understand, it was just to invite some of us with this habit to caution on some case.

Tw : harm.

>!it's just that, recently, I have slipped from taking a very hot shower to needing a trip to my general practitioner because a bad burn on the back.!<

>!When a tidal wave of dysphoria hit, I have in the recent past cross this line , so I just want to warn other people to be prudent about something they may inflict to themselves when their mental health is in a particularly low state!<
I'm hope so too, I really miss them and I'm so done hating myself. We'll get there one day <3 thank you
That's good :D
Oh for sure
You could always do a patch test! Just on a small part of your skin and then follow up with aloe! Let me know if you end up trying it out!
Yeah. I've actually wanted to send it to people to help them understand how I feel
Ah true lol I'm not a very metaphorical person lol
Thank you for sharing ❤️ that’s gotta be hard. I hope that comes soon and that it gives you all the gender euphoria!! I know there’s a lot of transfemme enby representation in this sub and not enough transmasc representation. You are seen!! ❤️
Same. Just got my date... July 2023. A long way off but it will be here before I know it!
Thank you so much ❤️❤️❤️
Is laser removal not easily done? Too expensive?
I wrote a heaps in depth response and then accidently deleted it! So tldr version with my preferences in brckets:

- exfoliate skin (Italy towel -once a week) helps prevent ingrown hairs
- type of shaver used (safety razor, 1 sharp blade = less irritation)
- technique: keep wrist straight, optimal angle of blade on skin, short downward strokes = effective shave and less need to go over area again = less irritation
- dry blade after use or in rubbing alcohol = stops rust and bacteria = less irritation
- After care: don't towel dry, air dry, if possible, which let's skin absorb water, then apply moisturizer. Also witchhazel can help. 

This is my way, and I've found it works for me anyway, I actually kind of like shaving now since it doesn't hurt and afterwards I have less dysphoria.
It’s okay ❤️ it takes time to figure things out. Labels are unimportant, get to know yourself and and explore how you want to dress/present 😊 it’s okay to try things out—clothes, pronouns, hair and makeup looks etc if that’s your thing. I’m rooting for you!
I’m so sorry, I had no idea. I will try to be more sensitive in my future comics! I have never done self harm, and strongly encourage others to not hurt themselves either! I am in therapy and think therapy is a great idea for anyone who experiences gender dysphoria.
I thought the representation was pretty 50/50, no? Thank you for the kind words! I just have to wait 4 months! Which is pretty doable. Especially because it is getting colder so I can wear more layers.
Yay! So happy for you. I'm underage and my parents are not quite the type to sign off on me getting top surgery so I'ma have to wait a couple of years :/ Excited for when I do get to though. Hope it goes awesome for you! :)
My pleasure 🥰🥰🥰
Depending on how much body hair you have and where you live, it can be quite expensive.

If I wanted to get rid of my complete unwanted body hair, I would have to pay ~5000€.
Expensive and awkward to do for a body job. Few years back I looked into it. 2-4 sessions with a healing period between  them to get my torso, pits, back, legs done. 

I don't have the urge to look it up again. Got one of those Philips one blades. Kicks ass for shaving large areas fast
Thank you so much! I shall try this ASAP! 😊
Thank you 😊
No need to be more sensitive, you can't take care of everyone, and have every corner covered.
You will always have people more fragile than anticipated.

And for what it worth, your work really resonate with me, and until recently, I will haved not have warn anyone about it .

The hot shower is really a good thing that really help numb the dysphoria usually....

It's not a matter of encouraging or discouraging in my case, it just ""happen"", and I just need to be aware about it.

Than for therapy, it's one of my problem: I'm on the free healthcare system of my country, and it doesn't go well (I detect Freudian BS coming from my psychologist....), So I have literally no help on the mental health side atm...(this not help).
Aw okay. I don’t spend a lot of time on this sub and saw a meme from an afab enby saying they felt unrepresented. Anyways! Glad you have that milestone to look forward to!! Very exciting :)
Oh shit I didn't take the body hair into account. That really adds up.
Oneblades are great, but personally that's not enough. I didn't think about body hair, but facial hair is a pain for me. I use a razor, even smoother than a oneblade, and it's still visible. It also grows back within a day. 

Other options like epilating and waxing require it to grow longer than I'm willing to walk around with, so I'm holding my hopes up for laser once I saved up enough.
Good luck!
Yup. I'd wanna get rid of everything below my head, and I've got relatively much hair growth literally everywhere. It really does add up quickly.
Yeah facial hair is such a lose lose if your trying to go without.

For me, I don't hate my face unless I am doing makeup. But my body hair is politely put....fucking thick ass public hair like strands on 90% of my front and 30% of my lower back"	x2i0lw	NonBinary	3463	1.0	2022-08-31 16:31:04
"Stop asking if you ""pass as non-binary"" (Rant)"	"That isn't a *thing*. You can't ""pass"" as non-binary any more than you can ""pass"" as gay. If you're gay you're gay. If you're non-binary, YOU. ARE. NON-BINARY.

**Non-binary** **≠ Androgyny.**

If you are asking if your clothing or makeup helps to make you look more androgynous because that's how *you* would like to look, that is a perfectly fine question. But carrying the mindset that non-binary people should look more androgynous as a way of more fully stepping into their enby identity is harmful to both you (believing you need to do *X* in order to ""pass"") and the non-binary community more broadly, where it can invalidate identity by setting irrelevant expectations based on looks, and can trigger dysphoria for others.

Thank you for listening to my TEDTalk.

EDIT: This also applies to seemingly positive posts saying, ""Look how enby I look today!"" -- because you can't ""look enby"", you *are* enby. You're just dressing in a way that further validates that for **you**, just as any other type of dress can be validating for another enby. ""I love how this clothing makes me feel like myself!"" = perfect."	"Thank you for saying this! Agreed! I’m so sick of seeing posts like those. It’s so invalidating for so many in our community. I, as an androgynous enby who loves androgyny for myself, don’t ever want to be seen as “more nonbinary” or more valid in my identity than enbies who aren’t or don’t want to be androgynous. The whole concept of “passing” is so harmful and is a huge step backwards in a community where we’re trying to show the world that anyone of any gender (or lack thereof) can and should express themselves however they want!
Thank you! It's triggering for me whenever people say that so it doesn't create a safe space for me here too. I get told all the time, as an actor, that I don't look non-binary enough, even tho that is bullshit. Considering leaving the group because of that.
Thank you for this post. I’ve been seeing a rise in the past week of these posts and it’s honestly been making me feel like crap. I’m also worried that newer/discovering enbies will think they have to look a certain way to be “truly” be nonbinary when that isn’t the case at all. That’s why I’m so glad that the r/LGBT subreddit made a new rule addressing this issue.
THANK YOU. It feels like this sub is 50% ""do I pass?"" and 50% ""what should my name be?"" and it's starting to become tiresome. Surely there are more interesting and relevant things we could discuss that are less likely to trigger dysphoria for people innocently scrolling.
I also don't really think that it's possible to look androgynous in the sense that many people mean it - I think some people use androgynous to mean having other people not be able to guess your assigned or presenting gender, which is incredibly difficult to achieve and depends entirely on the person looking at you and the cultural context in which you live.

I think it's more achievable to present androgynously in the sense of being read 50/50 by other people, or intentionally presenting mixed gender cues, but of course neither is necessary for being non-binary!
Ppl doesnt understand the difference between gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation
THANK YOU!!! This trend is suuuuuuper upsetting to me, and I think it ought to be added to the rules, because it makes me feel dysphoric and small. I literally hate the concept of passing. Like, do I pass the acceptance of the cis test?? It’s absurd.
THANK YOUUUUU. Nonbinary is an umbrella term. It does not mean ""genderless"".
A million times yes, queerness is about not fitting a mold and owning your whole self, androgyny is one way to express yourself but relegating non-binary people into an ambiguous “third gender” is so regressive. 

I really wish we could take some kind of action, to stop this constant gender checking. It’s so triggering !
Yes!!! It is so invalidating and harmful to this community to repeatedly see posts defining what classifies as a “non-binary look”. The point is that we are not confined to any look or definition. Gender euphoria is great and we are here to support each other’s self expression, but not to decide what does and doesn’t fit into a stereotypical view of what it means to be non-binary. When one person’s goal becomes recognized as a universal standard for non-binary presentation it can be so invalidating to other people.
Yeah that’s totally true. I just like always saying “yes you do” to those posts no matter what they look like lmao.

That’s basically the main reason I support their existence.
I agree with this. I’m AFAB and sometimes I present extremely feminine. Does that detract from the fact that I am non-binary? Absolutely not. Sometimes I present extremely masculine. Sometimes androgyny is the word of the day. None of these things weigh into the fact that I finally know who I am. That’s where the joy lies for me.
There have been days where I've just wanted to step out of this sub because I'm never going to look androgynous, I don't want to look androgynous, and I feel less valid because of all the pressure to do so.

It's bad enough outside of spaces like this, I don't like that it's coming from INSIDE these spaces, too.
I will never be androgynous. I have huge tits and a fat ass. That don't make me any less enby. 

Thank you for your ted talk.
 I don't believe in any kind of universal nonbinary expression - there's no way to pass as something people don't recognize the existence of in the first place - or even any universal expression of the binary genders. 

The idea of passing-as-goal is just so deeply toxic. At best, ""I must meet these arbitrary benchmarks of physicality and behavior for my own safety"" is symptomatic of a broken society, and at worst we get bullshit like ""if you cannot meet these arbitrary standards, you should just cease to exist"" and it's infuriating. Life is hard enough, don't tear down your sibs, we don't owe androgyny or ambiguity to anyone for any reason
Yeah as a trans masculine nonbinary person it really sucks to see so many younger folks (I'm 25) asking if they pass or not, as well as makes me feel less and less accepted as nonbinary since people view me as a man 90% of the time.

It shouldn't even be a thing for trans men and women honestly, because it still enforces colonialism and pushes western beauty standards and aesthetics onto people who have nothing to do with the person asking.

Our physical features do not have a gender, that's just what society wants us to believe so that we'll change ourselves to fit into cisnormative boxes. Not only is that not accessible to everyone, not everyone wants to change their bodies in ways that would make them ""pass"" and they shouldn't be made to feel wrong for that.

I know most in defense of this phenomenon will claim it's only about the feelings of those asking, but that's not true nor is it realistic. There will always be people who look like you and who don't have the same gender as you. Asking if you pass it's putting scrutiny on those people as well along with anyone else who may share key features with you that contribute to both how you view yourself and how others view you.
Honestly I'd like a ban on selfies as well as the 'do I look [gender]' posts, or at least limiting them to recurring threads on certain days. Inherent problems with seeking validation on one's appearance on the internet aside, they tend to detract from threads with more substantive discussion.
*Thank you.* I've been feeling like shit because I'm a little more femme than a lot of people on this subreddit. I am non-binary, but I present as femme sometimes. Not that I want to, that's just how it is

I appreciate you saying this
When i first came out I tried so hard to look androgynous as a large framed person. 
Eventually I realized I don't owe the world an image to make knowing me easier.
I agree with this so much there is no non-binary “look” hence the point but if people want to be androgynous look wise there is a community for that called r/androgynoushotties there they discuss questions such as do I “look” androgynous
The trend is very annoying, ngl.
Agreed. I’m tired of these posts and the ones asking if their name sounds gendered. I don’t want to focus on gender, I want to think as little about it as possible.
THANK YOU. 

I hate those posts too. I was recently told I can't be enby because I'm too feminine.
Like ok thanks, I just had a baby and I wasn't skinny enough to do physical androgyny in the first place (ever notice how enby fashion only ever seems to have uber skinny white models??) but thanks for erasing me due to factors beyond my control!
Yeah I keep asking myself if I need to find a different sub because I see those so often. They do kinda make me think “oh am I supposed to be aiming for a look?”
I’m so happy that people are addressing this more. I avoided enby spaces for a long time, and it took me a while to even feel comfortable IDing as enby, because of the equation of non-binary identities with androgyny and the expectation that being non-binary had to look a certain way. We’re all just people, and we’re non-binary. That doesn’t come with a certain look because we’re a diverse community and it’s really important to not project our personal experiences onto other people. There is no single valid way to be non-binary.
I DISAGREE.  One CAN look enby.  
They simply must be wearing a froggie hat.  
All jokes aside, I firmly agree.  I'm transmasc but I don't like to bind and a lot of the times the ""do I look enby"" posts are thin and flat chested and... yeah, yeah you do look like what cis people imagine enbys to look like.  But, I don't.  That doesn't make me look less enby.  FeelsBad™️.

Edited because I don't know how Reddit formatting works shhh
I like this. I wore make up once and then some of my friends said something like, “You are finally exptessing yourswlf!” I was like…..since I was assinged male at birth, I guess you assume any male expression is faked, but thst is not true. I love wearing suits. I love tight fitting tshirts (male style). I love being confident while dancing. I have been expressing myself since I was about 16. Granted I do hide some parts of myself, but that does not mean I “finally started expressing” myself when I fo something feminine. Just express myself in a new way.
Louder for the people at the back please. Can we pin this at top of our sub? Can we get sub rules of which this is one? Can we ban the posts that don't understand how counter productive they are being? These posts dominate our sub and push people away
thank you, i needed this.
Thank you for making this post. I am guilty of this mistake myself
THANK YOU
You are 100% correct. None of us owe androgyny. But this knowledge does nothing to take away the pain that I, a large masc-presenting brute, experience at everyday misgendering. No amount of education and no number of pronoun badges has eased my plight. Androgyny is my last resort.
Thank you im glad someone finally said it
Honestly? I needed this today.
THANK YOU! If we are outside of the binary box system, we shouldn't create another box. Fuck the boxes.
Honestly yeah. Some of the validation being sought is validation for the wrong thing.
Thank you 🙏 fr it's toxic
#THANK YOU

And can mods please enforce this?  Remove reported posts that are asking if someone passes/what their AGAB looks like? PLEASE?
110%. Thank you. Somebody enby who is AFAB, uses she pronouns, dresses up in skirts and full makeup every day is JUST AS NONBINARY AS SOMEBODY ANDROGYNOUS. Nonbinary doesn't have a look. You can't 'pass' as nonbinary. Clothes don't have gender. You can't dress more or less nonbinary
Honestly all those posts make me feel unwelcome for whatever reason and invalid. I question if I'm ""enby enough"" because I'm AMAB but identify as agender, but I don't like to wear things to make me look more fem because I'm not fem, I want to be outside of that binary.

I know I don't owe anyone androgyny but coming here and feeling not good enough did drain on my confidence that I am enby.
Thank you.

I've struggled with my enby identity because NOTHING about androgyny sounds appealing to me. I don't want to look androgynous at all. But for years, I believed that meant I wasn't non-binary because I thought ""real"" enby people looked androgynous. It's still something I struggle with. I still spend a lot of time telling myself that I'm not actually enby, because I'm AFAB and like to present as feminine. I doubt that will ever go completely away, but hearing and seeing people talk less about ""looking non-binary"" certainly wouldn't go unappreciated.
This. I don’t want to look more “nonbinary.” I just want to look less feminine.
Peole need to know that r/androgynous exists too
Would “Look how androgynous I look today!” be fine?
This. Yes.
I'm gonna link this post from now on
Agreed! Literally said the same thing yesterday in this same sub. Can we please stop replicating the cissexual idea of looking gendered?
Thank you!! I actually messaged the mods about this yesterday, hopefully they listen soon!!
As high femme nb ty
capital B Based
posts like that do make me sad
This!!!!
Thank you for saying exactly what I feel. I’ve been going to an lgbtq+ support group and saying exactly this every week! How I feel imposter phenomenon because I don’t always look androgynous, but that these feelings are wrong because it doesn’t matter what I look like to others, it matters how I feel about myself. Thank you again!
This post should be pinned
It gives ""you don't look trans"" /  ""you're pretty for a trans person"" / ""you're pretty for a black girl"" / ""you don't look autistic"" vibes.
Thank you! Even with hormones, I can't change my facial structure or body shape, so those posts feel invalidating, especially to a POC.
I agree with saying that an outfit makes someone feel good/pretty/whatever is a better way to phrase it.
You’re looking for r/nonbinaryover30 mi amor. The kids are still working on it.
Agreed
YES. THANK YOU.
So this. I have no non offensive way to describe my physical features.  I am short have a very curvy butt and large breasts.  I am not a woman but I am in that I share a lot of common experiences.  People assume I’m cisgender all the time. It’s frustrating. Because I constantly have to educate people and it takes a lot of energy. 

I am agender.  So under the umbrella trans-gender, not binary. , agender. It’s the closet fitting box. 

I literally had a women in transition berate be in this private group chat because she didn’t believe that non-binary folks being ignored in the sports world in terms of classification. She thought that “female gender based division doesn’t make me feel like I don’t belong because I don’t have a gender.

I had to leave the group and said some hurtful things which I regret. But I was so taken off guard because it was such a safe space. 

The original post was a lovely post that while a lot of the group were woman there where also non-binary folks who were part of and while we support them we don’t want to be erased. I
Everything about this!

I've been considering leaving this sub because all of those post really trigger my dysphoria and make me question if I'm ""really nonbinary enough"" because I am so femme presenting most of the time.
Thank youuuu!! I am not androgynous like at all. I would never be confused for a dude. It honestly sucks so much seeing people asking about this constantly and acting like being androgynous is the only way you can be nonbinary. We're all enby. Idc if you have massive boobs or a beard and chest hair. Idc if you like to wear tight tops and skirts or oversized jeans and hoodies. There's not a certain look you should have for people to respect you and use your pronouns. Honestly this sub makes me feel more insecure in my identity than anything has before. Be androgynous if that's you I'm so happy for you. But it's not me. It's not so many of us. I'm not gonna try fit myself into a tiny box right in between the male-female binary just so people respect me.
The idea of passing is toxic to begin with, even for binary trans people. It comes from a culture of “clocking” trans people and it just sucks. Plain and simple.
It sounds what people might be looking for is a ""vibe check"", which is probably a better way to phrase it than ""do I look androgynous/enby"".
This! Also the posts that are like “would you assume I’m AMAB or AFAB?” I just scroll by because I know they’re looking for affirmations but it really annoys me because your sex assigned at birth has nothing to do with being non-binary.
The purely aesthetic thing with the non-binary world is so fucking irritating. For some people that’s really all it is
That's the thing about passing. Because of the gender binary as a social structure, people will *try* to categorize everyone as one thing or another. Now, one could be in a position where people find it actively harder to categorize, but that is *because* they're *attempting* to do so. And when we talk about passing, that is the dynamic we're talking about. So I agree, it is kind of impossible to *'pass'* as nonbinary.

Slightly separate, but linked; as you say, there is no such thing as 'looking nonbinary', just as there is no such thing as 'looking gay'. If you are, then you are.
Mods sticky this pleeeease
Passing discussion always just ends up uplifting cis-het standards of how people are allowed to appear. Always gives me a bit of ""am I pleasing my oppressors"" vibe even when the question is ""Do I look neither male nor female?""

Not to mention how these kinds of post denigrate folks who can't or don't want to ""pass.""
Absolutely agree, you can identify as non-binary and dress however you like. 

You don't have to ""pass"" as anything other than your own authentic self.
Yes! THANK YOU! I can not upvote this enough.
Thank you for saying this, it was all I was seeing lol. I know for some people it's just something they're not aware of yet and maybe think the terms are interchangable and it's not their fault really, but it was getting very much.
I aim to look androgynous over non binary.  

I’m okay looking either male or female most days- but some days I want to look like neither and both at the same time. I enjoy diverse fashion and I want to look masculine sometimes and feminine others. It’s different for everyone. I consider myself non binary but I still prefer the pronoun she. I do get happy when people call me he on mistake though. It means I’m coming across the way I want to.
Thank you for saying that. I’m afab and with my height and figure I’ll always be perceived feminine and if I tried to force an androgynous look, I would at most look like a young boy, which I don’t want. Like, I’d love to look androgynous but the way I want it isn’t achievable for me so I’m just… mostly sticking to very basic clothing and everyone assumes I’m a woman 🤷
Its true that as a Nonbinary person there is no such thing as passing when you can dress as you please. I've also saw someone post a reddit for these kinds of things if people want to ask. 

Other than that as you said if they are asking I think it's a form of feedback especially if you're going for a certain look.
thank you for saying this. 💕

in other non-binary subs, people have - completely unprompted - told me how to change my body to fit their standards. & i do understand why they do that: my body is so lacking in traditional androgyny, it’d drive people absolutely wild to be forced to live in it. *i’m* not having a great time living in it.

but i don’t understand why people push a whole different set of standards instead of realizing that the standards are, in fact, the problem. it’s impossible for my body to obtain traditional androgyny: maybe the definition of traditional androgyny is the problem. maybe being androgynous being the only way to exist as non-binary in this world is the problem. maybe nobody’s body is the fucking problem.
Thank you this is very frustrating for me. I’m afab and I will always have curves but that doesn’t make me ANY less non-binary.
I think the discussion about passing as a binary man or woman is valid cause that can be about safety as much as it is about easing dysphoria. But I fear passing as nonbianary might make it seem like a solid third gender instead of the umbrella term it is. We can celebrate how presentation and even flagging give us gender euphoria but there's as many ways to ""look nonbianary"" as there are nonbianary people.
if i could upvote this 100x i would. it’s so annoying, i’ve considered leaving the forum bcs it’s constant posts like that. you look like a human in clothes, that’s it.
Facts. I’ve been seeing so many of these posts and every time I think 


“Do y’all not get it?”
THIS!!!! I adore the pics of people feeling good or trying out something new and looking for validation, or anyone who just wants to share a selfie :) it’s great seeing people in our community! I love y’all!

But please don’t ask about Passing unless you need help looking like a “cis” person for safety or something.

Always happy to help people asking how to look more masc/fem/androgynous etc. That’s absolutely fine! It’s a great way to find tips on reducing our dysphoria and making us feel happier! I always want you to be happier! (Yes, you reading this!).

If you don’t feel “nonbinary enough” that’s okay. I don’t most days either. It doesn’t mean anything bad. It doesn’t mean you aren’t valid. It means society is pushing us so many directions and we are trying to find out how best to express ourselves, be healthy and safe. Please just say you are feeling unsure or want to know if you are valid (you are! But it’s okay to ask that if you need to hear it!).

TL;DR: you are valid and great just how you are. But if you want specific advice or support, say so xxx
I really like the ""look how enby I look today"" posts because everybody looks so different.
You said it. This is why the term nonbinary exists in the first place. It’s literally a category so you don’t HAVE to fall into a gender category. Nonbinary is like a free space in a bingo game, or a free choice activity for art class. Anything you want. Anything YOU want.

If you are more feminine and want to present feminine features, go for it! You are not less valid or more valid than someone who chooses to present as androgynous.

If you want to present as androgynous, your presentation is not ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ because as nonbinary, you do not fit into binary gender constructs, and therefore don’t fit into one certain appearance to represent all.

My point is that, just do what makes you happy. Dress, act, talk, feel the way you want. You are not right or wrong. Stay safe, all.

- Kíeran, he/him (I still like this sub because identifying as nb for years was a big part of my identity, and I like to honor it. I also like complimenting people lol. And, my partner is nb, even though I’ma trans guy)
But we can still ask if we pass as androgynous, correct? It's really important for some of us.
thx!! the concept of ""passing"" as nonbinary has lowkey hurt me as an afab demigirl, bc it makez me feel like i can NEVER be even remotely fem/be ok with fem language or my identity wont be valid anymore and i wont be TRULY nonbinary, which is just absolute bullcrap. to me, skirts and shorts are just pieces of fabric and pinks and blues are just colors so idc abt fitting my presentation into a box, i just dress how i want and look how i want and ive gotta remind myself that doesnt make me ""less nonbinary"" or whatevr <3
This is right up there with referring to people as they/thems. There's already a gender neutral term for people that is not men or women. It's people/person. There's no need to make up a new word that plays off some non-binary people using they/them pronouns.
For myself it's a huge thing to also look more androgynous/masc-leaning/whatever. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I can't speak for others, but in my daily life I still get 85-95% of the time misgendered and I made a post a few days ago cause I really started to question my looks and efforts.

Some people have a drive to bring inner stuff to the outside. Like I also have some tattoos of the, for me, most important things. Like I have a tattoo for the people I lost in my life, but not everyone could think about getting a tattoo. Not only cause you have to find someone who is really able to do what you like, also some people just can't think of showing important things like that around.

In my native language and location you for example have no kind of ""they/them"". So I, as a patient with multiple chronic diseases, has every time to tell the docs to call me by chosen first name (extremely uncommon to do this, it's only ok if you are really familiar) and the formal use of ""you"".

Even if I do this, I still get all the time misgendered everywhere.

That is something that makes ME very dysphoric.

That's why I asked here, how others here would see me, cause I needed outside opinions.

I think the most others who post similar questions like how good they ""pass"" or what others think, is born out of similar issues.

Maybe that helps understanding a bit more both sides.
This is a very good point, but the same can be said if a trans men was to make a post asking ""do I pass as a man?. That's not invalidating trans men who don't wish or can't ""pass"" as a man. Getting called ""she, miss, young lady"" kills me. I can't reach into people's minds and scream ""I'm fucking nonbinary!!"" So I want something, anything about my outward appearance that can other people see that will get me gendered correctly.
As long as we’re ranting in here … wow I would love it if I could go ONE day without being bombarded with binary affirmations / celebrations / references here in the NONBINARY sub!

“Gender euphoria because I look so masculine today!” I … okay? Great? I’m happy for you, but … is this remotely on topic? “My partner called me her girlfriend and it was amazing!” Again … love it, I celebrate and elevate you, but in what possible way is that nonbinary?!?!

I struggle because gatekeeping is a shitty thing to do, but come on, this feels to me like going into the Skyrim sub and talking about how much you love Elden Ring, and it’s just CONSTANT in this sub!

</rant>, thanks for listening, and feel free to let me know if I’m thinking about this wrong, I’m open to feedback and learning
[deleted]
People want to look distinct from the men and women in their lives and that's valid actually. They're not asking for the one true enby form, and it's actually not very empathetic or nice to project that onto people. It's okay to care about how you're perceived and if you don't suffer from dysphoria, congrats, some people do tho and it's worth contemplating whether ""just look like how you want to"" is actually going to make someone feel better or not.

If you've spent your life only knowing what you're not, someone telling you you're heccin valid just do whatever kinda sucks!
Yeah… I dunno, “dressing in a way that validates you” and “signaling that you are non-binary with style choices” and “passing” are all kinda the same thing. Isn’t “I love how this clothing makes me feel about myself” just the subtext of a phrase like “Look how enby I look today?” Idk, I think for some (not all) playing with the ambiguities of everything is really enjoyable.

Like I pass as enby in the sense that when I meet new ppl out in the world I will sometimes be asked my pronouns (no one else will be asked this question) and when they assume, they go they/them. Ppl see my style and appearance and assume something about me.

That’s just passing no?
Stop gatekeeping and telling people the rules. There aren’t rules. People get to live their lives the way they want and you don’t get a say in it. We’ve been fighting too damn long to get other people to stop telling us how to live into our true selves to just let another group of people start telling us how to live.
I personally view social acceptance of your non-binary identity to be rooted in ""failing"" rather than ""passing"". When people who don't know are no longer reading you as either binary gender I'd consider you to do the non-binary equivalent of passing.
IS EVERY SOCIAL MEDIA CALLING ME OUT TONIGHT WTF?
[deleted]
I think a lot of it just comes from a mix of insecurity and still struggling to re-wire the brain to think of gender differently than how it is treated in the cis world. Ik it can suck to see bc the person clearly isnt really understanding a lot about what gender actually is, but I think it’s important to keep in mind that we’re all in different places of our gender journey and a lot of people are still learning and growing and becoming more comfortable. 
I think we as a community need to be careful how we treat other non-binary people who are still figuring themselves out and de-programming their way of thinking. It should be more of a priority to help our fellows than automatically get mad at them, even if it can be frustrating.
There was a post about this about two weeks ago, and it made me so happy at the time to see that other people had a similar opinion to me on this (it had several thousand upvotes). 

And then... Nothing was really done about it. I thought that maybe it would be added as one of the rules of the sub that you couldn't make those sorts of posts, because so many people were sick of them and commented saying so. But, nothing.

I was actually considering leaving this sub for exactly the reasons you mentioned until your post. I might hang around a little longer and see if things do change. If they don't, I guess I'll leave.

Edit: apologies, it was about 'what gender do I look?', not 'do I look enby?'. Both problematic questions tbh,  and ones it's clear many people here are sick of. https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/z0zyam/the_what_gender_do_you_assume_i_am_posts_need_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
Thank you. I know that there is supposedly an authentic look. I hate that there is an unspoken measurement. I'm nonbinary every day. My androgyny is innate. I don't have to wear it I'd perform it. It's not an aesthetic. It's in my spirit.
I agree. It makes me feel like I’m not nonbinary enough because I have long hair and look more feminine. Nonbinary shouldn’t have rules or certain ways to look. It makes no sense.
It is very very wrong but I don’t fault people thinking that they need to pass some kind of test for being non-binary Given that in every other group there seems to be some kind of criteria about how you need to be to do X otherwise you’re not  y enough. it is incorrect But not surprising to imagine that people think that it’s the same for this. What didn’t seem to get is the non-binary by its very definition Abandoned notion of traditional gender roles or even criteria in general. You are what you are because you say you are. You could be the most masculine Scottish highland games type man but not feel like that inside and if he were to Declared that he was non-binary he would be. People need to understand that it’s all about self affirmation and acceptance not the acceptance of people that somehow think it’s necessary to clamp criteria on something that by its very existence is criteria less
YW
Thanks I honestly needed to hear that
I appreciate the positivity of this post. However, I understand where people may be coming from with asking if they ""pass as nb"", because I've literally been asked ""how can you be non-binary with a big chest"" and also nobody at work can get my pronouns right even though I wear a pronoun pin AND we've had work meetings about it AND I correct them, they always want to address me as my AGAB. While how I've learned into my identity is what makes me comfortable, a v small part of it is also so people actually respect and remember and identify that I am nb 😞
Anyone who asks me if the pass from now on is only ever going to get a yes and aggressve support from me when others disagree.
The idea of passing and the standards set for passing are standards set by people who aren't even queer or trans.
Enough is enough. Let's set our own standards 💕
LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK
why limit it to enbys? it's less obvious but technically nobody passes as a woman or man either.
And not to mention the privilege that comes with being able to look androgynous in the first place
> is a huge step backwards in a community where we’re trying to show the world that anyone of any gender (or lack thereof) can and should express themselves however they want!

Preach 🙌🏽
Yessss like ik society loves boxes but why does it have to be a hierarchy? I dress more femme but it doesn't change how I feel about my gender.
I completely agree with this my androgyny is from my dysphoria non from me being non binary.
It’s so sad and wrong that you get told that. There is no way to “look nonbinary” so I’m sorry you have to hear such invalidating stuff all the time. I support you! Enbies can and should present in any way that makes them feel the best! And so should binary people for that matter!
100% yes
Cultural context speaks to another awkward aspect of this which is the appeal to the dominant cultural ideas of androgeny. Thin and white, to put it bluntly. It's not intentional, I know. But we should be better than not racist, we should be anti-racist: that means we face down our unconscious biases fearlessly and without getting defensive.

Let's play with gender norms freely, but not create new ones with which to police bodies.

With love to all my enby community!
Yes! Personally people gender me maybe 70% fem 30% masc and I'm sure that almost nobody see me and thinks ""oh an agender one"". We learned to put a gender to everyone so people do that automatically
>intentionally presenting mixed gender cues,

this is what a i personally prefer. realistically i am never going to be 50/50 androgynous so id rather go full genderfuck.
I can't imagine that you mean it's *impossible* to look androgynous in exactly the way you've described: causing great difficulty in guessing your AGAB.
I'd encourage people to ponder the difference between gender expression and gender perception as well. How other people interpret your expression can be at times (frustratingly) more consequential than your expression itself. It's an unpleasant reality that it breaks my heart to see queer people still facing despite how far society has come.
All posts where people are asking how others perceive them should be banned, to be honest because A: our perception is not going to be representative of the rest of the mostly cishet world and B: it's all grounded in stereotypes

It's not useful and is potentially quite upsetting. There should be a separate subreddit for it if people want feedback on their gender presentation
I second the idea about adding it to the rules !
I can relate! I was thinking this too!
Really well said
I really love the sub r/NonBinaryTalk for this reason ❤️
I agree about the “do I look [gender]” posts, but not selfies in general. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to share your look with people you should be able to expect to not judge you based on gender conformance. 

Yes, it’s validation-seeking, but some of us need a little bit of that from the online community because we don’t have access to any IRL support. 

I don’t begrudge anyone the need for validation. I think we *do* need to redirect what people are looking to have validated.
Yea no, with the amount of queerphobia in the world, we shouldn't be banning trans people from posting selfies. And there's nothing wrong with I th seeking validation if it's something you can't get easily irl
This 👆🏽 for me too ❤️
This 🙌🏽
I feel like its more for advice when asking though. If you want a certain look I think its fine to ask and give advice.

Then there are subreddits for that if asking.
Post on r/transpassing for posts like the person is describing
Yes because androgynous is a word that can be used as a descriptor of physical appearance, nonbinary cannot be used in that same way.
Also, stop asking people to name you!

A name should be personal, not the result of a Reddit thread.
Thank you for this.
Yes this! I honestly hate seeing any AMAB v AFAB discussions and tend to leave or mute a group when I see them. We’re all nonbinary, right? Why the focus on what’s in our pants when we know that it feels gross when the outside world is already so caught up about it.
Well said 🙌🏽
That would be fine.
I feel this. I'm not ok with fem language for myself it makes me feel squicky but 100% same for me otherwise
Im sure its more for advice. I think it's fine if people ask if certain clothing styles or whatever look they are going for would help.
Then make a post saying “do I look androgynous/masc” not “do I look non-binary”, that’s all the post was saying.
day 284829 of people mistaking gender identity for expression
You are in fact thinking about this the wrong way. Nonbinary doesn’t mean genderless. Nonbinary is an umbrella term that encompasses anyone who does not feel 100% man or 100% woman. Enbies can have no gender, multiple genders, etc. There’s no right way to be nonbinary. Nonbinary people can get euphoria from gendered terms. There are trans masculine enbies and trans feminine enbies, there are enbies who are both men and women (me), and sometimes it makes us euphoric to hear ourselves referred to in binary terms. I love being called boyfriend but that doesn’t make me less nonbinary. Your comment does come across as gatekeepy because, again, there is no right or wrong way to be nonbinary. Being nonbinary means something different to every enby.
I mean, there are nonbinary men and nonbinary women. Nonbinary doesn't just mean ""genderless"". So, posts about how happy someone is that were able to express their nonbinary gender are not out of place here.

Edit: actually, fuck it, I *hate* how hostile this place can be to literally anyone who is not 100% androgynous all the time. I'm nonbinary. I'm a dude. I like being masculine. I like being called ""husband"" and ""brother"". That makes me feel good, *because i am a nonbinary guy*. And it really, really feels like this place, which is supposed to be *for all nonbinary people* count me as a traitor to be kept out of this space. 

Which, fine. I don't have the fucking energy for this anymore. If you think I, a NONBINARY person, should be gatekept out of NONBINARY spaces I'll show myself out.
You really misread the post huh. OP isn’t trying to dictate how people look or stop them from looking androgynous, what they’re saying is that people saying “Do I look nonbinary” when they mean “do I look androgynous” can be harmful, as it implies that nonbinary=androgyny, when nonbinary people can actually look however they want and not just androgynous.
That’s not what OP is saying. This is about people using nonbinary when they mean androgynous. When someone is looking for validation in how they look they can say something like “do i look androgynous?” or any other descriptor. The issue here is that nonbinary is not an adjective that can describe physical appearance and when you use it like it is one, it’s very invalidating to nonbinary people who don’t fit that mold. 

OP isn’t saying “you’re valid, do whatever” they’re saying “you’re valid, do what feels right for YOU” they’re saying that there shouldn’t be any sort of expectation for how an enby “should” look because we can look any sort of way, same with binary people. 


It’s sort of like how a woman who is trying to look feminine shouldn’t say “do i look like a woman?” Because women can look any sort of way, masculine, feminine, androgynous, etc. What she should ask is “do i look feminine?” Because that’s not invalidating to the women who don’t look feminine.
Of course it’s valid, that’s not what I’m saying here
""look how enby I look today"" implies that *a specific look is nonbinary* and that *everyone who doesn't look like that doesn't look nonbinary*. ""This clothing makes my gender feel good"" doesn't do that.
Read the other comments in this thread to see why you’re looking at this the wrong way. I don’t feel like typing out a bunch of stuff again.
You can't really 'pass' as enby since there is no single way to present among all enbys. Some enbys are agender, some are multigenger, some are fluid, some are closer to one side of the binary than the other. All of those are very different. And even among the same gender identity people might want to present differently
I agree, but this is missing the point…
The entire concept of “passing” is based in binary gender norms.
saying 'not all non binary people present the same way and implying so is invalidating and bigoted' is not saying 'non binary people don't experience dysphoria'
Did you just try to pit people who dress androgynous and people who don't against each other?  We are all here because we identify or are questioning being non-binary. Nobody said androgynous dressing people are bad or have any other sort of ranking within this community.

The FACT of the matter is one's gender identity does not dictate how one should dress or look. Period.  Personally, I think using verbiage that correlates the two is harmful in any way that it's used.  I shouldn't feel like I'm ""doing it wrong"" or that my acquaintances are going to wonder if I'm ""faking it"" because I was AFAB and decided to wear a skirt today.
> there are some non-binary people where androgyny is the only cure for dysphoria

Then they're welcome to ask /r/androgyny how well they're pulling it off. While there's correlation between angrogyny and nonbinary people, it's not inherently linked. And frankly, it's taken me a lot longer to internalise this _precisely because_ of the number of people who post androgynous selfies here — impostor syndrome is a bitch.
A lot of people with that type of insecurity will see posts like this or overly-critical comments on their post and automatically want to hide away and disengage in the community. Which is really sad to me
i’m FINALLY being perceived as more androgynous to people now, but it took over a year of T and mostly my new mullet to make that happen. and i’m still perceived more as a girl than anything else, just an uptick of “are you a boy or a girl” question has happened in the past month
thank you
Yep. I dress almost exclusively in men's clothes but have a very feminine body shape so I read as feminine anyways.
Tbh I disagree with this sentiment. Being seen as androgynous is typically not a privilege, even if it’s gender affirming. Gender non conforming people are generally not treated very well by the general public I’ve found
I wouldn’t consider it a privilege cuz anyone can look androgynous if they try hard enough, just like how anyone can look more femme if they want to
My hero of the day
Right? Like, I'm a fat person. I'm not going to be gendered androgynously pretty much ever because people in the western world largely think it means 'thin white afab person with jaw-length hair'.
Androgyny is culturally relative for sure, because masculinity and femininity are likewise culturally relative. I'd most likely be considered far more androgynous in certain other cultures than in my own. Other cultures would see me as more masculine, because the feminine side of me isn't considered feminine there. Paradoxically this is both incredibly affirming and deeply soul-crushing.
Wait, I don't really get it, can you explain in more detail? 

There are PoC that look feminine, there are PoC that look masculine, why do you say that they can't look andro? /gen
I don't think that it's strictly impossible in the sense that it's never something any individual has been able to do - there are a lot of people in the world and I'm sure that a small percentage of manage it.

However, I feel like aiming for it is like aiming for the edge of a knife; most of the time you're going to end up on one side or the other. Even in situations where someone isn't sure about someone's gender, most cis people in my experience seem to prefer to just assume one or the other and hope for the best, so the end result is that you get read 50/50 rather than being read specifically as androgynous. They might recognize that you're a fairly androgynous person, but they'll still decide that you're an androgynous woman or an androgynous man.

This is because there's less of a social construct for non-binary people and what we look like, and what is there is primarily only for thin white afab people and therefore ends up contributing to the idea that non-binary people are just women-lite.

I point this out because I feel like attempting to fit into that small stereotyped and fairly privileged space to get read as non-binary in a few specific queer friendly cities is going to be a pretty difficult goal for most people, and I think if people are going to aim for that they should have realistic expectations.
honestly yeah this.

as much as i despise the concept of ""passing"" (even the NAME is so degrading), i cant ignore the fact that knowing how others read you can be important for ones safety in some situations/environments.
BUT. i agree that this really isnt the place for it, for exactly the reasons youve stated. all it does in an environment like this is cause harm.
why not here?
I don’t think I’ve ever phrased it that way, but thank you :)
As I said, I can only talk for myself^^

But for me it is very important to not look as my AGAB, cause it's really bothering me.

I have for example more curves than I would like, thanks to stuff like lipoedema. One day I will have to get Liposuction for it, although I know, that it's the second deadliest ""beauty"" surgery after BBL.

So from my point of view it's totally ok if someone needs opinions from others, who can more likely feel the struggle.
If you would have looked into my post, you would have seen, that I asked is I look masc-leaning to others.

Maybe try to read, BEFORE trying to smartass someone 🙄
Yeah, I fucked up. I apologize.
Similarly, ""they"" isn't ***the*** non-binary pronoun. There is no non-binary pronoun.

Any gender or non-gender can self-refer as they. 

And, a non-binary person can go by any pronoun. Even their AGAB. It's valid.
Very sincere thanks for the reply, I appreciate it. That helps a lot, I can see where I was making some big misunderstandings and assumptions. I have some more listening to do.
Yeah, your identity is valid and so is your frustration and anger at my ignorance. You absolutely belong here and now I think I’m the one who doesn’t. I didn’t understand what I was talking about and I apologize.
""you can't look enby"" great good love it very nice upvoteupvoteupvote

like come on. People can have their own understanding of femininity, but the average person is going to be _pretty good_ at estimating whether a stranger will gender a particular person as female or not. And I'm _struggling_ to understand how yalls aren't reducing their struggle to ""actually they should stop caring 🙃"" Doh! Why didn't! They think of that! Of course , we solved gender!

It would be great if gender were cordoned off into your own personal feelings but it isn't, _other people's understanding of gender matters to us_ whether we want it to or not.
My assumption is that you believe ""do i pass as non-binary"" is invalid. Like the understandable knee jerk reaction is that it's encouraging some form of gatekeeping but it feels a lot more complex than that
I feel like “this clothing makes my gender feel good” is a really… weird way of phrasing it tbh. “this clothing gives me gender euphoria” would be a better way of saying that one I think
Does it? Or is that just what you hear?
You know I did and I wasn’t convinced.
I agree, but only to an extent. ""Passing"" is a phenomenon that applies beyond just gender. It is a state of being in which how others perceive you is aligned to how you express yourself, and it's something we perpetually do unless we truly do not care about the perception of others. Few people can sincerely claim not to care about passing in some way or another, be that in regards to gender or something else.
I wish this would happen to me. All anyone sees is a boy and I have to present masc at work (conservative industry).
I feel like its hardly possible to be consistently considered androgynous. Once my face changed enough from T I'm treated as a guy. If I tie my hair back I'm stared at as a girl. People generally just pick one. I think its better to just try to get more people to stop assuming one or the other, and not feel weird if people are cautiously neutral.
I never said they had privilege in the way of being accepted into hegemonic gender norms, I’m saying that generally speaking in order to present androgynously, it requires access to more clothes, makeup, accessories, surgeries, etc etc to be read as “confusing” to most people which is in of itself, a privilege. 

When it comes to the privilege of partaking in hegemony, of course androgynous people don’t have that privilege, but having access to enough capital to present as they see fit, is a privilege many don’t have.
Not everyone can look androgynous. Stop blaming those of us who want to but can't for ""not trying hard enough"".
hard disagree.

i have a very hyper-female body shape, to the point where people ask if i have had plastic surgery or have some sorta estrogen disorder.

i have talked to multiple doctors: if i lost enough weight to be skinny enough to have an “androgynous” body shape (ie, no curves, bc that’s how mainstream society thinks about it), i’d actually die. i’d have to be so underweight that my body would fail.

so no, not everyone can have a “stereotypically androgynous” body - which is why we (in my opinion) need to expand the definition of androgyny to be more inclusive. people that identify with that word shouldn’t be excluded bc of how they look, regardless of gender identity or sex assigned at birth.
Yeah I could easily pass as AMAB in terms of build if I just didn’t have wide hips, which I mostly gave because of my weight (not huge, def not skinny). Because of that and my round (also from weight) face, I’m stuck getting misgendered.
It's not particular to androgeny. For someone to talk about whether they ""look X"" we are defining X and that calls on cultural norms. The dominant culture is white European, so that has a lot of gravity in all gender expressions.

Serena Williams is sometimes described in masculine terms, or be told she was born male. This is racist culture policing a PoC woman's body.

All bodies are policed, all genders of all ethnicities are policed, as a community we have the opportunity to not build up new ideals but celebrate all bodies.

Which I think many people do! Our community is wonderful! It's just something to watch ourselves for because unconscious bias is powerful.
I don't think they meant PoC can't look andro. When people on this sub speak of looking andro, they often have a particular ideal in mind that is informed by cultural, unconscious bias. Just look at the ref names that constantly come up for ""peak androgyny"" (like Bowie and Swinton).
Oh for sure. Most cis-het people probably have two drawers they can sort you into, and they'll only let someone sit on the countertop for so long until they decide where to put you. But even just the initial confusion would mean androgyny had been achieved IMO
no seriously what’s wrong with posting selfies here? Is it bad?
Reread the beginning of your comment and tell me again that I read it wrong.

That’s on you bro.
Yep! Pronouns are a form of gender expression and gender expression is not the same thing as gender! 

I go by they/he but i feel like i’m just as much of a woman as i am a man. They/he just feels better than they/he/she right now for me.
I appreciate you listening! We all have room to grow and learn, that’s what this community is for!
You’re misunderstanding me entirely. I’m not saying that people should ignore their dysphoria or “stop caring” about how they look or are perceived. I’m saying we need to stop conflating a certain look with being nonbinary because it really sucks for the nonbinary people who don’t have THAT look. 

Listen, other people’s understanding of gender *does* tend to matter to us, **and that’s why what I’m saying is so important**. As a community, we should not want society to equate androgyny with being nonbinary because that really really sucks for two major groups of people: non-androgynous enbies, and androgynous binary people. And it also gives people the complete wrong idea about what nonbinary means! Being nonbinary means something different to every single enby. The concept of passing is increasingly harmful to our community. 

No one is saying that people shouldn’t seek to have the presentation that makes them feel good, no one is saying that people can’t come here for validation, we’re saying stop using nonbinary as a physical descriptor when it isn’t one. Use terms that are more accurate so that you don’t alienate a huge portion of this community by making them feel like they’re not “nonbinary enough” just because they aren’t or don’t want to be androgynous!
No, it is of course more complex. My point is only that while I can empathize with the (likely painful) reasons why someone is asking that question, it also demonstrates that they are unaware of the pain that ripples out into a community beyond themselves by asking it. Evidenced by some of the other comments here including one where they feel like they can't be here anymore because those posts hurt too much.
That’s a matter of semantics because both statements you mention are saying the exact same thing if it is the clothing giving a person gender euphoria, the clothing *is* making their gender feel good. We should avoid policing how people express their satisfaction with their gender.
You read all the comments of people being like yeah these types of posts make me feel super excluded and alienated from this community? You don’t think that’s a bad thing? To alienate and exclude other enbies from our community.
If the question is based on appearance and vibes (feminine, masculine, androgynous, punk, cottagecore, or anything descriptive of a vibe) then it’s not based on gender. 

If you’re asking if you look like a man, woman, or non-binary, there are NO descriptors attached to those categories. The only metrics that exist are rooted in gender norms. 

I get that the majority of people assume gender based on appearance, but isn’t the goal to move away from that? Can’t women be masculine and men be feminine without their gender being assumed?
I feel you there completely mate. I have facial hair that particularly gives disphoria for me but it grows so fast that I can’t even bother sometimes.
If I dont know pronouns, i always use ‘they’ until I’m corrected and thats how I’m gonna keep doing it.
I agree with where you’re coming from, but I don’t think I agree that being androgynous requires money or privilege. Some of the most disenfranchised people in the world are poor trans women, who are often read as androgynous or gender ambiguous. 

We may be using different definitions of androgyny here. If you mean “someone who you cannot tell the gender of”, I agree that’s a pretty hard thing to do. Most people “pass” as either male or female, and it does require a lot of effort to be read as totally neutral in your presentation. 

I tend to think of androgyny as a combination of masculinity and femininity, which can be achieved by almost everyone. Tbh “a combination of masculinity and femininity” is the place a lot of “non passing” trans people find themselves, often not by choice. 

Let me know if I’m missing any part of your point here, I’m mostly operating from my own experience as a trans person who is perceived as androgynous most of the time
Woah there relax, I never once said I blame those who want to but “can’t” I’m just saying anyone can be androgynous just like anyone can be feminine. Just because someone doesn’t “pass” doesn’t mean they aren’t androgynous. A lot of people who are androgynous still get misgendered such as myself
Oh my god trying to dress more masc with my giant hips is a nightmare. I don't even necessarily want to be read as masculine but like sometimes I'd like to be read as slightly less feminine.
Well put!
I just talked over the post I did as a standalone. Cause the whole post here is ranting over others and it's just tiring.

Instead of talking to each other and try to reason, WHY someone thinks something excluding or whatever some people (and it seems like not a minority) more love to hate and rant about others, although we are a friggin minority in this world, as far as I know.

And again, it seems like you didn't take a look in a profile, you just tried to invalidate my experience and my kind of speech (hey, I'm not a native English speaker).

So, please go away and hate on others, I have better things to do.

You can come back after maturing and being able to have a proper talk.
>I go by they/he but i feel like i’m just as much of a woman as i am a man. They/he just feels better than they/he/she right now for me.

Yeah, thank goodness there's no need to restrict oneself. Wouldn't it be horrifying to feel uncomfortable with one's pronoun, but because of no alternative, be all ""okay this is my life now ***\*suffers\****""
fair, I feel like I only see posts asking for help and people not getting it but I don't see everything idk.
sure, but I don’t think the former is how anyone would ever refer to it
This. Keeping up with it has pushed me over the edge to when I can’t keep up it starts pushing me into self-harm ideation territory where I’m actually afraid I’m going to do something stupid while shaving, have a meltdown, then do something really incredibly fucking stupid.

Thankfully I’m going to start laser soon cause I’ve had enough of this negative feedback emotional shit.
I do that too. Hoping to normalize to people around me by just doing it alot.
Isn’t that just correct grammar?
We aren’t talking about binary trans people, we are talking about non-binary people. Androgyny as a “passing” goal, or as an aesthetic criterion that non-binary people must conform to or not be considered non-binary is a stance that comes from privilege.
I mean, I'm a very short very curvy AFAB human that rocks long hair I wont cut because it's culturally important to me. I'd love to know this secret way of being androgynous, cause it has literally never been my lived experience - despite flannel shirts, binders, or like...grilling while talking about nascar (lol, for real tho). I have never not been assumed to be my AGAB.

If there's a secret I'm missing someone please let a brother know.
No, you said anyone can ""look androgynous if they try hard enough"", which is simply not true. Pray tell me how am I supposed to look androgynous without the ability to wear binders or make-up, when I'm still automatically assumed to be female even with a buzz cut and wide, baggy clothes?

Yes, it is a privilege.
What the hell are you talking about
Also fair, I agree that helping and looking out for each other in this community is the #1 goal
Same here.
Yes. The other valid option is asking the person their pronouns, but sometimes people dont want to be asked their pronouns. All around, just using they until corrected seems like the appropriate answer.
I guess I don't see a huge distinction between binary and non-binary trans people in this context. There are non-binary people who medically transition (myself being one of them) and there are binary trans people who never medically transition. I think binary and non-binary trans people have more in common between the two groups than within either group, if that makes sense. There is so much diversity in the trans community that I find markers like ""binary"" and ""non-binary"" sort of immaterial. 

I agree with you that it's wrong to hold any trans person to any standards of ""passing."" I've found that in non-binary communities there is a very specific type of androgyny that is rewarded (white, thin, masculine-adjacent afab people) and any other type of androgyny is not really celebrated in the same way. I think this has more to do with white supremacy and transmisogyny than an actual acceptance of androgyny or gender nonconformity.

I think the idea that non-binary people should be expected to fit this standard comes from privilege, but I don't think that even most androgynous people fit this standard. There are a million ways to be androgynous, that's why I brought up ""non-passing"" trans people as an example of androgyny that most people aren't being pressured to emulate.
For me, also a curvy AFAB, it helped throwing out like 70% of my clothing. Skirts, dresses, very femme tops,... I sold it on Vinted.

Instead now I am wearing a more classy male style, what was a solution for me, cause I liked this kind of style before, but I totally get if not everyone feels like that.

But a big thing for me was chopping of my hair, cause it changes the looks of the face. 🤷🏻‍♂️ But I totally get you, when you say you don't want to get rid of it (and I always envied people with really long, nice hair, cause I could only grow it max to half my back 😬 and it didn't suit me...)

I had/have the ""advantage"" that my face is cut more androgynous or how my hubby would say ""German"" 😅😂

But I also have enough stuff there I have a problem with, cause it doesn't look like I want ^^'
There is no “secret” way and I’m sorry you have not had a good experience!
I can imagine how frustrating that is, I’m sorry you have had to deal with that
This just validated my point, thank you, I'm out.
Right, I think the idea that anyone should be pressured to fit an aesthetic goal comes from privilege relating to the things that you described, transmisogyny, white supremacy. 

I know it’s anecdotal but I have been told in my experience that I can’t be enby because I grow facial hair, and yes I too have noticed the masc adjacent androgyny. I suppose what I’m trying to say is that enbies get more comments on how they should be androgynous and are conflated with androgyny, whatever the definition is, should use specific pronouns, etc while binary trans people experience the same oppression but in a different way. 

It’s like how Caitlyn Jenner talks about how trans women who don’t pass are giving her a bad name. She’s saying so from a place of privilege.
I really appreciate the advice! I should totally rock classy menswear... especially when it's too extra for the occasion. I think ascots deserve a comeback!! (I'm like...kinda serious??? Lol).

I'm a member of the Long Hair Clan of the Eastern Band of Cherokee, so...cutting my hair would kinda be giving the middle finger to my heritage. At least to me! I know literally one in my tribe or clan cares, but I care ..even though it makes people misgender me :/ damn...epic flowing locks...

The same for non-binary people, you don’t need dysphoria! Happy pride month!		"That’s what said to myself. And that’s how it all started for me. Then I came out to my wife. Hello dysphoria. Come out to a couple friends. Oh what’s this, yes even more dysphoria. As I become more comfortable accepting I am a woman, I am less and leas comfortable with my body or social mentioning of maleness. I hate being called sir!  Right now I am not out of the world so the sir thing happens all the time and it hurts every time. I never expected that at all.
Also, keep in mind that many trans people don’t experience dysphoria until AFTER their eggs crack. Just because you don’t experience dysphoria now does not mean that you won’t. Also, chances are high that you have experienced dysphoria and you haven't even realized it. This twitter thread lists some common ways people experience dysphoria without knowing it: https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215740224325783553
You hear that, Dysphoria? I don't need you, go away!
You know, I presented this idea to an ex of mine (who is trans), and she completely shot me down with 'no, your not trans' and stopped answering my questions or even acknowledging that I was talking, so I really needed to hear this op. Thank you. Enjoy my first paid award :)
Personally, I've never felt any gender euphoria. I just know of it, but that's it. I've only ever felt dysphoria. 

I'm happy for people who feel gender euphoria, but it's not like one is a better indicator than the other. They're just two sides of the same coin.
An important lesson I have learned is that ‘gender dysphoria’ doesn’t always indicate that you want to undergo physical transition. For many folks, dysphoria is about the separation of their perception of themself from that of the outside world, which can often be addressed with a change in pronouns or presentation, or even simply having their identity acknowledged. 

There is a misconception that dysphoria means “wants bottom surgery,” or “wants to fully transition,” but like trans identity itself, dysphoria is a spectrum. 

For example, I don’t personally want to medically transition, but I do feel deep dysphoria over the way my body is perceived and the social and cultural expectations that are placed on me as a result.
I didn't start getting dysphoria until recently when I cracked the nonbinary egg and now I feel it with my deadname, sometimes top dysphoria, in my experience it's like a lancing feeling in my chest and it hurts like hell.  I wish I had a more feminine body but like with broad shoulders?  I dunno that makes no sense.
I have no euphoria or dysphoria I'm just so indifferent / neutral either way but know assigned gender fits less than being non-binary.

No one way of being!
This! It never occurred to me that I might be trans, I just always considered myself a ""tomboy"" until the first time I did masc makeup for a cosplay and was like:

This is me. This is who I want to see when I look in the mirror. Look at how handsome I am!
you also don't need euphoria to be trans. (btw, if ur trans u innately have dysphoria. it may not be physical dysphoria and it may not be very strong, but its obviously there otherwise u wouldnt go through all the tough stuff that is included with being trans. for example, if a set of pronouns make u feel icky, thats dysphoria)
euphoria made me realise I was non-binary too!
I think this is kind of a misunderstanding of dysphoria/euphoria. It’s both the same coin, just two sides of it. I think any trans person means with dysphoria basically you feel different than your AGAB, if that isn’t the case, why ID as trans/enby
It depends what you see as euphoria because for me is really rare to be hyper happy I never had the magical aha moment for the topical things . I can be happy to wear binder for example but I never had the revelation moment
I have a lot of dysphoria with the male sex... I don't know if I am a trans girl or just am non-binary... I can only say that this makes me feel suicidal... It's been long 17 years of depression :(
I didn't have dysphoria when I first realised. I was happy for months! Then my mum found out that I was non-binary, and gave me so much dysphoria that last night I almost cried after realising that I can't move out yet. :)
Euphoria really helped me realise that I'm non binary. (With the pronouns he/they) and since I am not out at home I have people in the internet call me my preferred pronouns and name(moss) and it gives me so much euphoria that it helps combat the dysphoria that I don't have to deal with alot. And if I ever get questioned ""it's just an oc for roleplay(cause I'm in that community)"" or ""it's just a fake online name"".
Exactly! We shouldn’t define people by how much pain they’re in.
One of my earliest memories of feeling like I wasn't the gender I was assigned was when I was 8 and had my hair cut into a short pixie. I wore cargo shorts and baggy tshirts and I was ecstatic whenever anyone mistook me for a boy. And now as I live my life as a nonbinary person, if anything I feel dysphoric only because I know I won't be seen as anything other than a woman by society unless I medically transition, which I don't really want to do anyway. I guess that's more like social dysphoria...?
Exactly, why should we base our transness on suffering instead of joy?
Aaa this is so validating, thank you!! I get tons of euphoria from wearing a binder and thinking about getting top surgery one day (I’m AFAB), but I don’t feel dysphoria from the way I am now!
also this is a little reminder that gender dysphoria doesn't make you trans/not cis ! nobody can tell you if your identity is valid or not, only you can know who you truly are !
Is euphoria not an indicator of dysphoria? Genuine question. And even if you don’t need dysphoria to be trans, do you need gender incongruence? Thanks.
I’m having some conflicting things going on with trying to understand myself. I’m not sure if it’s jut the fact people have been using my name more often but I feel a deep sorta “cringe” whenever I hear someone say it. My non binary name is silly though so I don’t want to make people use it
One of the things that helped me realise I was nonbinary was recognising that I experience gender euphoria. I do get dysphoria sometimes, but that’s more to do with socialising and being perceived in a way I’m not always comfortable with, which then starts the feelings towards my body. I don’t want to be treated as a cis woman because I’m not, and that can be so draining and painful because it makes me doubt myself.

Working out what sparks *euphoria* instead in me and trying to encourage that as much as possible has absolutely turned my life around. I feel like for the first time since puberty really I’m comfortable in my own skin, I’m not confused about who I am anymore, I’m taking everything each day at a time but I just feel so much happier and lighter.
Someone really needs to explain this to my doctor. ""I am here to help PeOpLe WhO AcTouLy NeEd It"".
Euphoria figured it out for me. Dysphoria came after when I realised what I'd been suppressing for 25 years. So eggs, follow the euphoria.
I haven’t ever felt euphoria yet though because after 5 years I still can’t transition at all…
That's great to know! \^ \^I would have experienced Euphoria from the sports bra I ordered... if it wasn't so small for me🙃
Ahh screams, yes! You dont even need to want to change your body to be trans, just be you 💞 you're amazing, if yera trans dude but atill wanna rock this tibbies? Frikennrock those tibbies you look fantastic ! If yer a trans women but dont wanna part with yer epic peepee? Then don't ! Keep the shlong, it makes you happy so who cares what others think?
Hecc even if you tuly identify as an airplane or tree, go ahead ! Just recognize you are in a human body and don't hurt yourself and others! I love you all bishes.
I always feel so happy for people who don’t experience dysphoria but also a little jealous. I wish I only had euphoria but instead it’s a rare experience 😔
I have an amazing little skip in my chest every time someone addresses me as ""they"". It's a great indicator indeed.
I'm not sure if it's considered having dysphoria, but I had the longest time this obsession to be ""normal"". Then realized that my normal is being nonbinary asexual and wow! The euphoria just keeps overflowing. 😄✌️
For me, I didn’t necessarily feel dysphoric when presenting fully masculine (i.e. suits are swag as hell) but my distress stemmed from feeling unable to express my femininity.

I still consider myself to have dysphoria, but I suppose it may be more accurate to say I hate the limitations that maleness placed on acceptable sources of euphoria.
I made a whole podcast episode about this and why my partner (a trans woman) and I (enby, genderfluid) think this should be the norm!! I'll link incase you want to listen, but I couldn't agree more with what you're saying!!

https://pca.st/episode/d2306512-9924-4b53-afbb-51ba4af8c913
I love this! Each individual's story is unique and personal to them. You do not have to check off any specific box to be who you are! This is a wonderfully positive message :)

For anyone who does struggle with dysphoria and is needing some help, I just finished reading this and it was quite an excellent little short read! 

https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096LWWBQV
I'm asking myself if I can get a mastectomy, even if I don't feel that strong disphoria. It would just feel better...
non-binary people are trans people! 💕
As someone currently attempting to Figure Things Out^(TM), I found this really helpful... Thank you for sharing!
Bro why would anyone put themself through the stress of dealing with doctors and insurance and becoming broke and coming out to family and going through medical treatment if they weren’t experiencing dysphoria?
[removed]
Is there some symbolism with the lack of neck stitching stuff on the 4th panel, like them feeling more connected to themself and their body by having the confidence and will to determine their own identity, or was it just an accident? Either way, death of the author. Good touch.
I am not trying to attack anyone but if you don't have gender dysphoria and you're happy with your gender why promote change?
I sadly know exactly what you mean…. I feel the same even tho an a much less big scale, i wish you best of luck that it soon gets better and you can feel more comfortable!
Same! I spent 30 years either not noticing or not experiencing dysphoria, and it's only as I began to experience gender euphoria that the dysphoria has started to rear up.
I’ve been feeling like I might be a man for years, but the dysphoria hurt so much when I started actually exploring my gender, that I just started suppressing it by going back to being a “woman” for a couple years. It’s coming back though and now I don’t know what to do because I can’t tell if I’m male or nonbinary. I’d prefer living as a man and identifying as such but I can’t find a way to tell if I actually *am* one.
Same here! Figured out I'm nonbinary and didn't think I'd have to change pronouns but the longer time goes and the more I peel back the layers that were covering up, well, me, the more I began to really have a distain toward things that hadn't bothered me.
I'd always hated my chest but thought that's because they're H at this point and that's freaking ridiculous... never really thought of that as disphoria but shit I guess it might be.. excuse me while I spiral for a bit
Me to my therapist: “Well, I don’t really experience dysphoria. I just feel like the way I see myself and my gender and the way society sees me don’t match up and it’s really frustrating.”

My therapist: “Well, that is gender dysphoria.”

Me: “Ohhhhh...”
Damn while I knew on some level that my extensive depersonalization was related to my immense dysphoria, I never gave it any thought as I didn't see the point. This was an interesting read to say the least.
Thank you so much for sharing this! I was positive I was going to read that thread and not relate to any of the experiences that were talked about but almost every single one hit me like a freight train. Things I was doing since I was a CHILD were mentioned there as signs of possibly being trans and I think I'm starting to question how much of myself is identifying as nonbinary but might actually be full on trans. Its extremely scared on one hand. I cannot possibly ever get the necessary help I need if I am, I am financially broke and I do not live in a location surrounded by people who would be supportive, and I fear I never will anytime soon. But on the other, I'm finally beginning to understand myself, and all I want in life is to find out who I am and love myself for it.
Thank you so much for this. I'm not crying. Okay I'm crying.
Just say no your dysphoria can’t legally harm you without consent! Just threaten it with a lawyer!
Thank God it's an ""Ex""
Yes that is totally right, there is no one indicator that everyone needs to have
Social dysphoria is where most of my dysphoria comes from, too. Being perceived as a woman based on the body I have seriously fucks with me. My new name and pronouns helped a *lot*, and I’ve had my hair short for like 8 years, even before I truly cracked and came out lol
Exactly. I’m a trans man and I recently decided I won’t be medically transitioning with hormones. I’ll get top surgery for my own comfort but I’m technically choosing to go back in the closet for future interactions even though I’ve been out socially for over five years.

My decision has been a drastically odd one in my community - I am going to stick out like a sore thumb. And I don’t care.

My dysphoria is still present, but I personally have learned I would rather manage it with a combination of good mental health practices and exercise than be visibly trans. My reasons are inherently selfish but that’s my prerogative. I don’t want to be a target, I want to travel all over the world with no issues, and I don’t want to be beholden to hormones for my entire life.

Dysphoria is so varied and how it is managed is varied too. I was convinced for 5 years the only way to treat my dysphoria was to medically transition. I still think for the vast majority of binary trans people that is the best option. But not for me. 

I wish I had realised I don’t need to tell everyone about my gender earlier. I felt for so long that I was being dishonest by not telling people I was trans, so I forced myself out of the closet way before I was ready.

Now I am going back in, and I’m staying there except for with a few close friends and family. I don’t feel everyone is entitled to know my gender just by looking at me. It’s private. They can address me as a woman and she/her and it won’t change who I am. 

I’m happy to be at this point but I know everyone’s dysphoria tolerance level is different and so I would never offer this up as a prescriptive “quick fix”. 

I hope people learn that dysphoria is hugely varied and what it means to an individual is just that - individual and wholly unique.
I get that people keep saying ""dysphoria is diverse"" which is true ofc but let people say how they feel in the ways they want to.
Exactly this! You don’t have to feel horrible about who you are right now to know that you would be much happier Beeing someone else! Happy for you that you found out who you really are!
Yeah, this is why the phrasing of ""you don't need dysphoria"" can be confusing. 

You need either dysphoria or euphoria to be trans. Most people experience both in some capacity. However, either one may go unnoticed or unrecognized. Therefore, if you do not notice dysphoria for any reason, but do notice euphoria, you may be trans. If you notice dysphoria, but don't notice euphoria for any reason, you may be trans. If you don't have either, you're probably not trans.
For the first time I hear someone saying you don't need euphoria too. I doubt a lot and lack of prominent burst of happiness euphoria and clear dysphoria makes it so hard for me
I never understood this, but as it's recently been explained to me:

All trans people experience dysphoria in some form, however, dysphoria is sometimes undetectable. The person might not recognize what it is, it might be covered up or meshed in with other body image issues, or it might not be noticeable when compared to other emotional/mental health problems. Therefore, while dysphoria can be an indicator that you are trans, it is not the only indicator, nor the most reliable one.

For me, my dysphoria has been very obvious to me since I was a child, even before I had the vocabulary or knowledge to describe what being transgender meant. I've also experienced very few emotional/mental health trials outside of experiences related to being trans. So I never understood how someone could ""not have"" dysphoria.
I think people use the term gender incongruence for that, but i may be wrong. Not my first language sorry
It also depends what you see as feeling bad enough to be real dysphoria,I often spiral into doubt and avoid saying thst I have dysphoria same with euphoria I can be happy for something but because it isn't the big big happiness I feel like it isn't what it is supposed to be
Sending love 💕
Screw this imma come out
Update: I'm still closted, my mom didn't understand it and if she does then she's ignoring it
You don’t have to feel horrible in you body to know that you feel better as someone with another sex so you can be just ok with your body but wanting to have the body of a boy instead
Oh how I hate medical staff who are like this…. If you don’t want to help people who suffer you should have picked a different job….
I think if there is norm people will spiral in doubt no matter the norm. Not having euphoria also can make you doubt especially if you expect the magical I know it /this is right moment and it never comes
It depends, I see myself as trans and non binary what is with the definition of the word completely right but not every non binary person wants to see themself as trans
Medical transition doesn't equal being nonbinary or trans. This post is about the identity, not the process of transition. They are not synonymous and you can be nonbinary or binary trans without medically transitioning.
Nah this isn't it
Don’t having dysphoria don’t mean beeing happy with your gender
Because while wearing a burlap sack is ok, wearing a cotton outfit is infinitely better
Wow another late comer. I’m 40 and am just figuring it out. It’s a mindfuck. Of course you add everything up and can’t believe that you can’t see it. No CIs males don’t fantasy they are a woman every night with a name and picture in their mind all their lives just to fall asleep. No boys don’t think about how an accident could happen to their genitalia that would force a doctor to make them a girl. It’s like 2+2=4 not 7. And I’ve been saying it’s 7 all my life and if you said it wasn’t then I was going to change my behavior whether conscious or unconscious to conform. Society fucks us up big time.
The beauty of this life, if you're safe to do so, you can explore! Try the pronouns on for size around safe and trusted people in your life. We can always change our minds, exploring your gender doesn't always need confidence to jumping from one side to the other, though that is also a ok if it feels right to you:) 
I just want to repeat, we can change our minds and there is no shame or harm in that. 
What was it that hurt about exploring your gender in the past? Feel free to msg
Me too!

woah thank you for this. I've been dancing around exactly that thought for weeks now. Reading this made me surprisingly burst into tears. Thanks :)
I feel this way but my imposter syndrome says that all cis women feel this way because of misogny or whatever. I don't actually think I feel this way because of that, my social dysphoria is about being straight up seen as a woman at all because I'm agender and hate being seen as gendered in any way. It's distressing to even see people suggest 'female' has to equal woman or to group me with women. But of course my brain is like 'But! But! But!'. Tiring. It's like my brain can accept every other trans person's identification of their own experiences as dysphoria, but with me, it *has* to be something else, it *can't* be dysphoria, it's almost like it's not allowed to be. Very frustrating. I'm tired of my brain.
Good idea! Lemme teach that fucker a lesson!
Ace Attorney: the Dysphoric Turnabout
In fact, I dumped her before that week ended. After that non-discussion, we ended up getting in a huge fight a few days later over something unrelated and I decided to walk away.
“Social dysphoria” is a great way to describe it. I feel fine with my body, but not the way my body lines up with my socialization. 

And just to be totally clear, there’s no WRONG way to be trans or nonbinary and no wrong way to find that identity! No one is more or less valid based on their reasons for their identity or presentation!
Reading this actually made me feel a bit better because I live in a context where I can't be out and likely can't medically transition even if I wanted to. Seeing other options that still involve me being who I am and sharing that with the people that are important but also managing my dysphoria and identity in other ways is very helpful. I used to think the only choice I had was deny my identity entirely.

I also think this is helpful for nonbinary folks with dysphoria that can't be helped by medical transition (because most transition makes you masculine or feminine, and if that isn't your identity, then what? I'm agender, there are no surgeries to make me pass as agender). And also enbies who will never be correctly gendered by strangers because they can't 'pass' as not a man or woman (most people don't even knowing being nonbinary exists, so there is no passing for most of us, especially those of us who aren't transfemme or transmasc and wouldn't be happy passing as binary genders). I wish this was talked about more. I need to learn to cope with social dysphoria because I'm never going to pass as my actual gender. I understand the trans communities focus on medical transition because it's what most trans people need, but there need to be discussions about others ways to cope for those of us whom transition won't work for.
I think your final statement sums it all up. Our identities are a spectrum, and our needs and expressions related to our identities evolve over time. The only thing we HAVE to be is ourselves, however we wish to do so, whatever that means for each person.

I stated this in another comment, but what is important to me most of all is that trans people deserve access to any kind of identity affirming care we need, be it medical transition, HRT, legal transition, trans-affirming counseling, down to safe and independent housing, as a matter of human rights.

Which aspects of that we all need and wish to take part in comes down to the individual, but the access to care ought to be universal.
mhm! and if u notice one, u definitely Have the other as well even if u can't recognize it.
It's also prescriptive to say ""all trans people experience dysphoria"". Even if true in whatever way, people should be able to express their own experiences in their own way. I don't have dysphoria even if people say ""I have to"" and explain whatever I'm feeling as dysphoria. It doesn't bother me but I know it does bother others, if that makes sense.
No you’re right, people do use that word for that. What I meant to say is when people say dysphoria, they usually mean gender incongruence
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ proud of you
That is totally fair!! I just think euphoria is a more widely held experience among the trans/gender expansive community, and just a less medicalized & less painful metric to focus on if we have to focus on something. However, I absolutely agree with you - at the end of the day, a person is trans if they identity as trans regardless of ANY other metrics :)
[removed]
I have had some sort of facial hair for a large part of my adult life. At this point however, I want to claw any hint of shadow out of my face. It's weird, but I actually feel a direction now, and I care about myself so much more.
> Of course you add everything up and can’t believe that you can’t see it.

Just want to note for the benefit anyone questioning that this is not always the case.
Sometimes you don't have memories that provide clues that you're trans.
Definitely an egg cracking moment for me lmfao. 

I would sit there thinking “Wow it seems so freeing to be nonbinary, that just makes so much sense and I really relate to how nonbinary people seem to feel. Too bad I am cis!” without just... taking that one step of realization.
I believe if you are seeking medical transition or hormone therapy, the focus will be on physical dysphoria for which HRT or medical transition is an effective and appropriate treatment, so if that is why you were visiting that psychologist, that may be why they focused specifically on parsing whether you experience dysphoria for which HRT or medical transition is an effective treatment.

If not, it could be the case that, because you are seeking a medical waiver of some kind, the doctor is employing a much stricter view of the concept of “dysphoria” in order to limit the number of medical waivers granted for these reasons.

Or they could just be a doctor with a particularly limited view of what it means to be trans or nonbinary based on transmedicalist ideas. 

Either way, social dysphoria (as someone in another comment aptly referred to it) is very real, and doesn’t always overlap with physical dysphoria. But it also may be treated through methods other than HRT or medical transition, which may not be an appropriate treatment for people experiencing social dysphoria.

That said, I believe people know what they want, and who they want to be, and I trust any trans person’s view of themself and their needs.

eta: why would I be downvoted? I don’t know this person’s experience or story, which is why I spoke in general terms about why we may have had different experiences with different doctors, and why different doctors may take differing views, which seemed like what was in question.
I hope they are relieved or happy tears! I had a similar moment when I got this message. I hope the next steps of your journey are beautiful and affirming!
The idea of “imposter syndrome” is totally relatable to me. I had this thought process like, “Yes, I am dissatisfied with the perception of my gender by society, and I feel distress over the implications and expectations my gendered socialization has placed on me because of my body, but I would KNOW if I was trans and nonbinary, so because I’m only questioning, that can’t be me.”

Of course, the idea that trans and nonbinary people inherently know their identity and don’t go through long, always evolving periods of questioning is totally a fallacy on my part, a thought I gave myself to compartmentalize the challenges I knew I would (and have) face in confronting the part of me that had been questioning for so long.

I feel very thankful that I have a therapist that I got comfortable with through treating my anxiety and other stuff that I was eventually able to bring it up and work through it in a positive, trans-affirming way. I know most folks don’t have access to resources like that but I wish so bad that everyone did.
my trans phoenix headcanon is quaking
I totally get you and have solidarity with you. A big part of my decision was feeling distanced from cis men, and that my identity as a man wasn’t the same as theirs. It’s why I’m in this sub and have even told some people I’m nonbinary to make it easier for them to “deal with me”. 

Gender is so complex. I can’t fully ever imagine being able to look and be recognised as who I am in my mind. So I am settling for something simpler. 

There is a rhetoric of bravery regarding medical transition and visible transness in our communities and whilst I think that narrative is useful, it’s not prescriptive and we can’t all be beholden to it. I’m not less brave because I chose not to transition with testosterone. I’m not less trans because I don’t come out. 

I know much of our discourse is, as you said, centred around progression and ensuring trans healthcare is even available in its most basic sense. But I wish we could talk as a community more openly about other options without being shot down, or even worse shoved into the same corner as terfs. 

Like, dude. I’m from the UK. It’s basically TERF island. I know my view on “accepting my body” is drastically more complex than the average “adult female human” believes it to be. 

I want my voice and others like mine amplified too, so these people don’t end up painting trans people in two camps - medically transitioned and “detransitioned because they got it wrong.” 

It’s not the case. Our choices and experiences are so complex.
Yeah definitely depends on who youre talking to. But i agree :)
Thank you! My mom just said ""thanks"" lol
I have big problem with that both sides I overanalyze them and spiral into medicalist thinking
What do you mean it makes cis people get dysphoria? GNC people who are transitioning aren't cis by definition (unless they choose to identify that way which is also ok) but are also entitled to hormonal therapy? Policing someone's gender/gender expression is the dangerous thing here.
I can relate to this *so* much.

I, too, wore a beard from adolescence until the end of last year. I hated my chin, and the beard helped hide it. Nevermind that it made me look **more** masculine, I just didn't care enough to shave it and doing nothing was easy. 

Before allowing myself to come to terms with the notion that I'm trans, I just sort of... Coasted through life, doing the bare minimum, playing it safe. Since my egg cracked, I've been paying so much attention to my health - I'm dieting (properly), taking care of my skin and hair, and cut out alcohol abuse. Working on quitting smoking next. 

Discovering who you are gives you a purpose and the resolve to meet your destiny head-on, and I couldn't be more excited.
I get this!  Shave it. You will feel better. I did this weekend.
This makes me think of the way Daniel Lavery has written about the time before he started to transition, which really hit home for me: “I wish I were trans, then I could transition! But since I’m not, I guess I’ll just have to keep THINKING about transition all the time, without actually doing anything.” y’all: if you think all the time that you’d really love to be trans, nonbinary, etc. — congrats, you can be, and very likely already are!
I had my first gender-affirming therapy Appt last week, he said “well you seem really all over the place, and I haven’t heard you just SAY that you’re non-binary. If you could just take away all the guilt and external factors, how would you like to present?” 
And I’m like “uhhhh... like this. I’m still having a hard time understanding it myself, I can’t think of any other way to be.”
Big think lol
I think im having a realization
[deleted]
BTW, I should have clarified that there is a big issue with medical professionals not trusting trans people to know what our own needs are and what care will alleviate our dysphoria/activate our euphoria. 

I believe trans people are our own best judges of the care we need, and I believe HRT, medical transition, legal transition, trans-affirming counseling, and all other resources people need to live as themselves down to safe housing, should be available to everyone as a matter of human rights.
>I had this thought process like, “Yes, I am dissatisfied with the perception of my gender by society, and I feel distress over the implications and expectations my gendered socialization has placed on me because of my body, but I would KNOW if I was trans and nonbinary, so because I’m only questioning, that can’t be me.”

This is spot on how I feel. Like exactly.

And yeah, I really wish had a trans friendly therapist to work through this with. I have what I'm pretty sure is depression, or *some* other mental fuckery that makes me pretty nonfunctional, but I'm not sure I can get it treated any time soon. There's also gender stuff tangled up in there but there are no gender therapists in my country to my knowledge, and I don't know if I'd ever find a trans friendly one. Even gender euphoria is hard to feel in a prolonged way because ~depression~. Saps the joy out of you and all that. But I'm glad at least some people have access to that and to some kind of understanding and validation.
Yeah that can be so tough :( We deal with so much medicalist thinking from the outside, especially as many (but not all) trans & gender expansive folx HAVE to interact with the medical system (ie to medically transition). So we hear all of this medicalized diagnosing and gatekeeping and judging and UGH, it can absolutely become internalized. I'm sorry you struggle with spiraling into that, and I'm extra sorry our stupid society put it in your head in the first place. Again, all that is required to be trans is to identify as such - you are so valid!! ❤️
[removed]
I already have, plus more. Once HRT starts the hair will hopefully get finer and reduce the effort needed.
Ahhh, that is so relatable! 

The number one thing therapy has helped me with is understanding that there is no “right” way to be nonbinary or trans, and that many nonbinary and trans people go through evolutions of identity and terminology as we discover ourselves, and that’s totally valid and ok! Being tied to one identity or concept of identity that can never evolve or change is a cis thing. By understanding we are not cis, we free ourselves of those rigid structures and make room to experiment, experience things, and discover our true identities.

I hope your journey is fulfilling and affirming, even when it is hard!!!
Yes, a definite brain genius moment on my part : )

Tbh I really had to have someone help me answer the questions I had to know if I was REALLY feeling the things I felt and not like imagining them, as weird as that sounds!
Right on. I hope my language was clear that I wasn’t assuming where you are at or want to go in your transition : )

I hope you’re able to get the care you’re seeking through the VA!
I am sorry that the care that would help you is so out of reach. 

I am absolutely not any kind of therapist or counselor, but if you ever just need someone to talk to or commiserate with that has been on the same journey, please feel free to DM me. The least I can do is lend an ear : )
Can we chat ? You sound like so nice person
That sounds like you're talking about ""detransitioning"" which is an argument made by anti-trans people in order to delegitimize trans people. People don't transition for the heck of it, they do so because they want to. 

Your arguments are just garbage at this point so I'm disengaging.
Ahh further along then me. HRT is likely a ways off. But who know. It’s all moved so fast in my mind since coming out to my wife and a couple friends. I don’t really like this skin I wear either.
Absolutely! I'm always happy to chat :)
[removed]
Bold of you to assume I'm downvoting when you have multiple downvotes lmao.

I am non-binary and well versed in transphobic arguments, this being one. It also perpetuating truscum discourse, which is gatekeeping grossness.

If anybody is trying to make tomboys and GNC people transition against their will, that too is oppressive, but you're getting mad at the wrong crowd for the wrong reasons. Maybe try and reflect on why your comments are getting downvoted. There isn't one way to be trans. ""Cis people transitioning"" and ""regretting it"" is like, such a prominent transphobic argument so it's sickening you're trying to use it here

As someone who’s AMAB and has huge jawline + chin dysphoria, Florence Welch and Kira Buckland kinda help me cope and made me realize that many Cis Woman have prominent jawlines and are still able to look feminine		"A strong jawline is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE. They literally make me melt and I strive to have a prominent jawline. Love yourself and that spectacular jawline I’m sure you have
[According to TVTropes Kira came out as non-binary last year](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KiraBuckland)
If its anything; for jawline look at the singer Sophie Ellis Baxter, she rocks it!
Hey, I’ve got a strong jaw _and_ a big nose. My massive celebrity crush on Florence Welch helped me realise both can be beautiful.
When you look at any feature, you can find cis women who have that same feature. If that's a feature you want to keep, go for it. I hope to keep a strong jawline myself.

Obviously though gender dysphoria is about you and not anyone else. I have a massive forehead, and so do a lot of cis women (like Rhianna). It still makes me dysphoric as fuck, and I plan to fix it.
Geena Davis? Sophie Turner? https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/sophie-turner-sag-awards-red-carpet.jpg  Kiera Knightley? I would kill for Jameela Jamil's chin. Jennifer Garner could be the lamp in a lighthouse. Hell, even Angelina Jolie and Olivia Wilde.
You look like the female version of Elliot from SDV, and this makes me very happy.
I was dysphoric about my strong jaw until I started paying attention to celebrities. 

Tons of models and actresses have SUPER strong jawlines, and it’s a part of what makes them beautiful!
Jennifer Aniston also has a pretty prominent Jaw Line. She was my absolute biggest crush as a kid.
Katie McGrath (Lena Luthor) has a strongly defined jawline which is admired by many sapphics!
There are models, like [Paulina Porizkova](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulina_Porizkova) known for they strong jawline.
Strong jawlines are hot in everyone
Indeed. I'd love a powerful Boudica to sweep me off my feet.
Wait this is sorta inspirational 😭💜
Personally, women with strong jaws are so so attractive. I love that.
I have a friend who is a cis woman and has a very prominant jaw. She's a literal model.  

Rock your heavy jaw, gorgeous bean.
as a sapphic (non-binary) person, women with prominent jawlines are everything to me
I think it doesn't matter if you have a sharp jaw, it's attractive on most people either way and you look absolutely gorgeous! Don't let anything get in your way, you're super pretty and seem nice, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
You should look at Dante Gabriel Rosetti's paintings, many of which feature very beautiful women with strong jaw lines:) Florence Welch looks like she walked straight out of one if his paintings in my opinion
Sigourney Weaver is inspo because she looks completely common to me
Florence Welch is such an angel, she's been a huge inspiration for me!
I’m AFAB and have a prominent jawline. Strong jawlines are beautiful, just as any other type of jawline is , but please know you are beautiful however you want to present and you definitely can be whatever you want to be even with a strong jaw ❤️
Florence Welsh is EVERYTHING.
Reminds me of when someone posts a picture of a famous cis woman and caption it something trans-related, and suddenly the hottest celebrity becomes ""disgusting"" and ""obviously male.""

My favorite recently was Sigourney Weaver.
Lucy Lawless has a prominent jawline and well-defined features...and she's everyone's fave!
I like bigger jawlines, I like faces a lot and a bigger jawline means there's more face space to dote on. 
I also find larger jawlines give an air of openness and calm to a face. You look lovely, for sure.
I love a good strong jawline on a femme!
Look up Laura Jane Grace. She's a punk musician who happens to be trans and boy oh boy is she a BABE.
I'm fighting the opposite problem, I have a weak jaw and look way too femme. wish we could just switch body parts :')
Thanks for posting this. My jawline dives me absolutely crazy. I feel like everything else I can work with but my jawline makes me dysphoric af
Same amen to you enby ✊🏻
No offense bestie but these are pretty normal jawlines for AFABs. 

Try Ellie Goulding
Gorgeous. You are androgynous and gorgeous. Reminiscent of Bowie. He was soft and masculine and femme and hard. Same thing with Prince. He was a lover of heels, but could snatch women from any man in a full set of heels and walk, strut and dance in them. Aside from shredding. In any case, you're fucking amazing. Can't wait to see you in new looks regularly!
Florence Welch does not look feminine
Thank you :) I’m still planning on getting FFS after a while on HRT (not on HRT yet) but yeah when my hair is longer it’s not thaaaat noticeable, cause I thankfully have naturally feminine lips and eyes. But yeah I‘m trying to love my features even though it’s difficult
Oh my goodness mine as well. A femme person with a big nose and strong jaw? Yes please always.
Oops sorry didn’t know that, that’s awesome
Oh wow, her jawline is much stronger than mine and she looks great
Have you seen her ""Free"" music video? The whole thing had me in awe at how much confidence =beauty. She's a gorgeous woman already but her self assurance just makes her all the more stunning.

Plus the dress/over coat combo is 🧑‍🍳👄🤌
Thats so True :)
Also, to anyone reading this with an insecurity about these features there's plenty of people who think they look great. And they do!

For as long as I can remember I've really liked prominent noses especially. There's even a subreddit for them 😄
A good reminder. When I have that dysphoria where I’m microscopically deconstructing my image saying “that’s too AGAB” it would help to think of people with that feature and without that AGAB that I think are rocking it. 

A general tip that I’ve found useful is having a few things that I always love about my appearance to derail those thoughts and get them on a positive path, but I never thought of applying it gender-wise
Im flattered that you think that’s me, but that’s Florence Welsh
Oh wow she looks great!
I’ve asked so many of my mates if they want to swap body parts. Sadly they all declined…
I completely get it! I’m AFAB and if you ask me, I look like a 12 year old boy lol. Or as my friend once said, a soft boy. It’s definitely difficult, but it’s amazing on days where you’re feeling euphoric and like you can take on anything just because you’re okay with how you look, even for a minute
I feel like I have a big nose and I absolutely hate it. Strong jawline tho? GOD PLEASE
[Here's the tweet where they mention using she/they pronouns](https://twitter.com/KiraBuckland/status/1215921714804060160?s=20&t=VhBwAg4-mPoRtnC9LivoFA)
Yeah definitely
Olivia Wilde, too
Just gave the first thirty odd seconds a watch, have to check the whole thing out later. It *does* look great.
Aw, I'm blushing!
I think autocorrect sabotaged her surname there.
Yeah that’s true, it’s always great having small shimmers of euphoria :) Softboy is actually my first goal on HRT. I’ve set myself some goals like firstly trying to look like a feminine man/UwU soft boy which is achievable for me and slowly I’m trying to go for a more femme yet sophisticated and androgynous vibe :) (ruffled/frilly blouses and leather pants)
I looove big noses! One of my friends has this angular huge old world European nose and just seeing her makes me go weak in the knees. Don’t hate your nose!

Now me? I got a jaw/chin like Jay Leno..
Does using she/they automatically mean someone came out as nonbinary? Bc ive seen a lot of cis women do that too

Did anyone else have body dysmorphia and dysphoria at the same time? I sure did		"The fact that the cartoon person is quite skinny but still thinks their stomach is fat is also super accurate. If I were a skeleton, I would still be upset about my “adult womanly curves.”
Yeah, but I'm also actually overweight, so it's hard to figure out how much is psychological vs how much is actually in need of change.
Big time. Especially right now. Binders don't squish my boobs all the way down...so with my belly fat they just look like A or B cups, rather than pecs or a flat chest. If I didn't have my tummy, maybe I could pass them off as pecs...

Note: it doesn't help that my family is overly obsessed with belly fat anyway and constantly points out when someone is ""chubby""
[deleted]
the question is, if I as an AMAB person should take HRT, because having boobs might be a problem, but I would like my features feminized
The horror and euphoria I felt when I tried my first binder was unexpected. I loved having a flat chest, but when I looked down or in a mirror my stomach seemed to be more prominent than before.

It was kind of a one step forward two steps back kind of thing since I was still recovering from an ED at the time
I think almost every nb/trans person I know did/does. Including myself at times
I think that they are often connected pretty closely to each other.
I experienced both, now I'm just unsure if it might started as dysphoria and I just thought it's dysmorphia, but it definitely developed into dysmorphia.

I think when you hate your body because of dysphoria at some point you can get dysmorphia because of that. It's soul crushing to hate your own appearance.
Yeah I had a lot of body dysmorphia as a teen, and it makes it tough for me to remember whether I was actually dysphoric back then or not. I had a lot of issues with my stomach as well, even though I was really skinny, just the tiny bit of body fat that was there made me feel really insecure. Also lowkey I constantly thought about having a more feminine face and using makeup for winged eyeliner and wanted a more feminine face. All my dysphoria gave me the same feelings as dysphoria because I thought of all of my flaws as masculine.
I... I thought this was just me until literally just now.
Haha, I had top surgery two months ago, and, while I'm super happy with the results, one of my first thoughts was ""wow I need to lose weight"" XD now that I can actually see my big belly
Would've gotten top surgery already if my boobs weren't this good at hiding my belly tbh
i often can't tell the difference, i just hate everything about this flesh prison
Yup, basically.
Yeah, I definatly do
I had an ED and the body dysmorphia stuck around a bit, but i've done so much work on accepting my body that it's rare and so is physical dysphoria. most of the time im just like... yeah ok it's a meatsuit idc
For folx who are taking low dose/full dose T, does it make it a little easier to lose belly weight or do you gain more in particular there?  My first clinic appointment is in two weeks and part of me is concerned about how my body will change but also excited for big changes such as top surgery!
“Man I wish I lost weight so my stomach would be smaller.”

Wait no that makes the tibbies more obvious!

“Oh yeah true I wish I could get top surgery.”

Ahhh no that makes the tummy seem bigger!
🤦‍♂️
Thank you for normalizing this! Binding has made me way more self conscious about my stomach. I thought I was the only one
When I was a young AMAB kid going through puberty, I ended up 5'11"" and 135 lbs. by the end of high school. I looked like I'd been forcibly starved, but I couldn't see that. All I saw was that my chest didn't stick out past my stomach, and thus I was ""fat"". I'm in my 30s now, and a *lot* of the work I've had to do on myself has been to undo the harmful postures and habits I adopted to try to compensate for my shape. Things like learning to breathe into my belly and learning what it feels like to let my stomach muscles ""relax"" instead of remaining frozen in place all the time. Ironically, those habits have been a lot of what's made it difficult for me to actually feel different in my body as I've transitioned, because I've remained locked in unnatural and uncomfortable postures.

One of the reasons exercise can be important is that it can short-circuit some of those bad postural habits. If you're doing an activity you love, be that running, biking, basketball, rock-climbing, whatever, there will be moments where you forget to censor yourself because you're feeling from the inside out, instead of from the outside-onto. It can be scary, because in the short term it puts you in a position to see those ""flaws"" put on display. But in the long term, moving through those postures can give your body the freedom it needs more adeptly recruit its various muscles to move in ways that feel natural for both your heart and your body.

Anyway, dysmorphia sucks. It's telling you shitty lies about the meaning and significance of shapes that are natural for your body (and for a lot of bodies). Those lies will always be persuasive, but they won't always be the loudest voice in the room. Loving your body as it is doesn't come easy, especially not for us trans folks. But you can get there, and it'll feel so much better the more you get the hang of it.
[removed]
omg same bro same QwQ
 in order to prevent this from happening i will just get tiny boobs
*yeah.*

yeah.
Every day
I still do ahah
I'm really not happy with my weight right now (Ive gained a lot with covid). And the sad thing is, I've been 40 lbs lighter than I am now and looked great, and even then I thought I ought to lose 20 lbs to reach my ideal weight.
I COULDNT PUT THIS INTO WORDS BUT HOLY COW THIS IS IT
35 and still do.
*laughs in future tense*
After surgery I was so focused on this lol! It just shifted to a new thing, so I wasn’t surprised that I got self conscious about other aspects of my body. For me, I worry that my shoulders are too broad and that I am too shapeless (I’m afab, but have a more boxy shape). The dysmorphia hits random areas sometimes! At times it’s hard to even really recognize myself or my body, so the dysmorphia can be really jarring. 

Anyone else post op that has mixed feelings about having a flat chest? I know so many people want one, but it can go back and forth for me in terms of how I view my body.
As someone who's recently came out as Demifluid and started identifying as a guy sometimes, and I've always have had body issues, it is always a pain when my body issues and my chest issues are at the same time.
Yes. I love wearing bikinis after finally having a toned stomach. It feels just like the picture.
I am right now!
yup I do now and I'm kinda able to distinguish them apart so I know when I'm feeling dysphoric or dysmorphic
Yes absolutely.  It canbe super hellish at times! Also still struggle to figure out which is which sometimes!
Yeah. My son has both and it's rough. All love to those of you struggling, shit is hard enough without our brains turning on us.
Thats exactly why I'm afraid of getting a binder :p
I've read being nb makes you super at risk for eating disorders...believe it too, the other day I was just thinking about how I don't have the guts to try to get hrt or surgery so ""I'll just lose weight until I pass"" at the same time ""Maybe I don't actually want to pass and I'm just lying to myself and want to lose weight, maybe I'd be happy if I do XYZ not related to transition""...Double edged stress sword

Obviously keeping an eye on myself to make sure I don't do anything too unhealthy. Running, veggies, and water is the way to go
If you like my art I also have a comic! [https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/elis-adventures/list?title\_no=608234](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/elis-adventures/list?title_no=608234)
I’m currently feeling this right now :( body dysmorphia makes me feel super fat and ugly and dysphoria makes me feel 10x more uncomfortable and unwelcome in my body. It fucking sucks :/
Am fat, probably couldn't have the ideal body anyway. Not without 1000's of dollars in surgery
I may be completely stupid, but what is dysmorphia? I've heard of it, but I don't know what it is...
Yes,
i have a goblin body (skinny limbs but fat torso) and my breasts don't make it any better so i have both 😔
I do. I'm overweight and it makes all my curves more noticable. 😭 I'm afraid if/when I lose weight, my body will be more feminine than before
yep. i’ve slowly been learning to differentiate the two but it can get confusing.
I sure do.
Yes constantly about my hips to the point where I genuinely don't understand what they look like anymore
What's dysmorphia?
What is the difference?
Yep, it's awful... I can't look to myself in the mirror anymore, it's to painful
I like to think I’m a fat man looking at his man boobies
THIS. IS. ME.
I think I’m more gender fluid than a gender neutral but feel a lot more comfortable with the non-binary label, this does mean that at any given moment I like that I have boobs, hate that my tummy exists, hate my dark body hair but the next I hate the boobs, hate the feminine figure, wishing I was more muscular. So I experience both, sometimes at the same time. I find just always being clothed helps lol
I definitely did. And still do- It’s literal garbage and I’m glad I’m able to recognize it more now. This cartoon describes me perfectly, especially about a year ago.
Exactly. I spent so many years of my life obsessed with the way my stomach looked that I developed a really unhealthy relationship with food and started hating myself. I’m still recovering honestly
Adult woman look is so accurate explanation and it often makes me think I just fear growing up tho I am almost 22
same
I think what’s important is truly seeing yourself as beautiful/handsome, regardless of your weight. I think it’s possible to be conscious of your health while still loving yourself completely <3
for what its worth, you don't *need* to change your body bc it's overweight! it's not like putting on a few extra points automatically makes you unhealthy
I TOTALLY relate to this! My binder used to push my stomach out around the bottom of my binder so instead of seeing flat pecs, I saw a weird ""dent"" in my side profile. Also, wtf why is society so focused on belly fat??? I blame the ""Obesity Epidemic"" scare of the 1980s.
To be fair, a lot of cis guys with a bit of a stomach also have a decently sized chest. I understand that’s not necessarily helpful if you still want to get completely flat but they probably just look like pecs to any outsider looking in. 

Your family sounds really shitty. My father did the same thing and it completely destroyed my self-esteem. I’m so sorry you had to go through that :(
I can only speak for the limited experience that comes with wearing breastforms occasionally, but the difference in my posture with and without them is profound. The presence or absence of that tissue can have a significant impact on the degree of tilt in your chest, stomach, and hips that feels ""relaxed"". I wouldn't be surprised if after top surgery you were able to settle into new postures that would reduce that feeling/appearance of your stomach bulging. Even if that doesn't happen, though, finding comfort in your body is what really makes your shape look and feel great, no matter what shape that happens to be.
Exactly this!
YES! I feel this!
This is the eternal question for me as well
I would suggest talking to your doctor about when to get off of HRT so you can have more feminine features but only to the extent you want.
Might be worth looking into SERMs like raloxifene, less available/studied than ""typical"" hrt but seems to be good at feminization without breast growth
Yes I feel this! My binder used to push my stomach fat out so instead of having a flat chest I just noticed a weird dent where my binder line hit my ""fluffy"" abdomen.
Oh okay that makes sense. I was diagnosed with dysmorphia in high school before I was able to come out as NB so that makes much more sense
It absolutely is. I hated my body from 6th grade to my freshman year of college. I still struggle! Sometimes, I find that I'm relieved to have dysphoria because it's something more manageable than body dysmorphia. That's pretty messed up, I know.
Its tough to find a line between dysmorphia and dysphoria. For me, it's the subtle differences in how dysmorphia and dysphoria make me feel.
That's one of the things holding me back, yet I know I probably need top surgery either way lmao.i really want the procedure, but I'm worried people will see my stomach more easily as well as my hips. I'd rather that than people see my boobs though smh
okay actually this is one of my biggest fears! I don't want my dysmorphia to come back once I get surgery!!! My ribcage sticks out a little bit so it makes my pecs seem shrunken. It's scary because I can't use my boobs to hide my belly when I wear big shirts once I get surgery...
this is way too relatable.
Me too. The huge difference between my body dysmorphia and my dysphoria is that my unhappiness with my figure comes from anxiety about my stomach, but unhappiness from my dysphoria comes from an incongruency with how I identify my gender and how my body looks. There are totally different feelings attached to dysphoria and dysmorphia, and recognizing that has honestly been really validating for me when I'm defending my gender expression.
I'm trying to get to the ""it's just a meat suit"" mindset but that's a big step for me haha
I haven't started T but my doctor has a lot of meetings with me about the process. He said those starting T often gain weight easier, but depending on your exercise routine it will either be muscle mass OR body fat. I've heard of both situations happening, but the difference is the person's dietary/exercise habits. Making sure you have a VERY solid diet plan will ensure your belly fat either stays the same or reduces, while you might gain weight from pure muscle growth. My doctor also said I should expect a slight increase in my metabolic rate, so losing weight will be easier in the future. He said there was a very very small chance of that, however.
god the struggle is so damn real
This was incredible. Thank you so so much for sharing your experience and being vulnerable! I totally agree, exercise helped me fix my bad habit of always ""sucking in"" my stomach. And you're right, exercise is self expression from the inside-out! I've never though of it that way! Thank you so much for bringing me this new perspective. <3
I used to be the same way. My body dysmorphia often got so severe I would completely forget I even felt dysphoric. For a long time growing up, I didn't even realize I was experiencing dysphoria because my obsession with my stomach size consumed my life. Trust me when I say this: you're not fat. You're absolutely stunning. I'm 100% positive. If you can let yourself feel beautiful/handsome, your dysmorphia will slowly go away. That's what worked for me, at least! Granted, dysmorphia never really goes away completely, but it WILL dwindle and that will allow you to focus on other aspects of yourself you want to improve on.
Do you have a favorite outfit you can wear and hype yourself up in the mirror? My therapist has me look at myself in the mirror every morning and tell myself three things I find handsome about my body. It's honestly helped me a lot!
I haven't had top surgery yet, but I'm sure when I do I'll likely start getting a bit more dysmorphia than I'd like. I know Miles McKenna talked about his struggle with self image after top surgery in one of his videos. I HIGHLY recommend watching his channel. He has a lot of really valuable insight!
nooo
Me too! I mean, to be fair, I've had 20 years of experience in this...
Ooooh, yea. I definitely suggest KT tape over a binder by FAR. Binders worsened my dysmorphia a lot. KT tape is more form-fitting.
Do you feel handsome/beautiful though? Because truly that's all that matters. If you feel confident about yourself, other people will see that and see how stunning you are!
its basically thinking you have a big flaw in your appearance and feeling insecure about it. idk thats how i think of it at least.
me too ;-;
You are describing me exactly.
I thought that for a while too, until I realized I would feel ok about being an adult person-who-is-not-a-woman.
I'd have to be either or those to see myself as them...
That's a pretty optimistic take on how this tends to work out. My doctor is trans himself and specializes in trans healthcare and would never claim that you can tailor (or even predict) how your body responds to HRT. We're still trying to figure out how this stuff works. I was on a variety of pills and injections for 2 years and while my body was more feminine, I saw almost no breast growth. Who knows why. I was recently off for 9 months and my body has essentially fully remasculinized - even some of the facial hair I'd lasered off has grown back in that time. For AMAB folks, pretty much the only change that *would* stick around after stopping is if our breasts have grown significantly.
I've already had cancer, I don't want to put less studied substances into my body :/
It's definitely something I was prepared for, but it still surprised me a bit. Before surgery I was too self conscious to work out, so I think it'll be much better now anyway
It's definitely something to consider. For me it was hands down worth it. It's much easier for me to deal with being self conscious about my weight than it is to deal with dysphoria. But I can totally understand why other people wouldn't have the same experience as me. I'd definitely recommend talking to someone about your concerns, even a surgeon if you have one in mind. I talked to my surgeon about my weight and body image a while before surgery and he was very helpful with letting me know what to expect
Can you describe your experience of these totally different feelings? I’m having a lot of trouble telling them apart rn
Thank you!  Yeah, guess I'll be budgeting more exercise gear and time into my life.
Unfortunately I've grown out of a lot of my clothes from gaining weight. I haven't worn a nice outfit in a while but that's a nice idea to do during covid.
No?
ah, ok. So it's like, if I was hypothetically really insecure about my leg hair from a purely aesthetic reason (and nothing to do with my enby-ness), is it stuff like that?
I don't know what you look like in real life, but I bet you're stunning. You have the support of this entire community <3
It's not like new new, just new to trans stuff. It's been used for a long time by postmenopausal women as an alternative to estrogens, due to it's lower risk of breast cancer
I absolutely want top surgery. I'll absolutely talk to the doctor about my concerns, though. I have to go through a military process so I don't know my surgeon yet, but hopefully they can answer my questions. Thanks!
Sorry I just meant that I'm sad you struggle with dysphoria and dysmorphia. I know how hard that is
yeah something like that!
ah, gotcha. thanks!
whoa, just curious (as a person about to join the coast guard) is this a ""military process"" as in you are able to talk about the disphoria and think about treatment while on active duty?
Oh yeah, but it’s fine. One day I’ll be more comfortable in my body...hopefully
Yes! I’m American so the Biden Administration just repealed President Trumps transgender service members ban so now I get to be treated for dysphoria with medical aid and therapy!
Oh my god! I was aware that Biden had made things better but I didn't know the military actually helped provide care! If you don't mind me asking--Is it much of the expenses covered or only a little bit? Do you worry that it might make promotion more difficult? I'm honestly painstakingly putting off gender therapy because my recruiter is already asking for so much medical stuff to prove I don't have any issue to serve (ex proving I don't need adhd meds) and I worry that a diagnoses of dysphoria might stop me from getting in. (edit--Like I know dysphoria isn't a banning factor, but it just seems like the less on your mental health record, the better, you know?  Wanna see if I can slip under the radar for the beginning process, I guess)
All expenses paid, baby! You just have to go through an EXTREMELY slow system. I had to first get diagnosed with gender dysphoria by the military therapist. That took about a month of sessions. Then I had to get a referral to medically transition from him AND my doctor. That got sent to my military hospital around a month and a half ago and the team there has to review and approve it. THEN I go in for a preliminary appointment and they can see if they’re gonna approve me or not. THEN I can’t get surgery until my entire chain of command approves my “transgender care plan” that I have to make with the hospital team. It’s gonna take a fuck ton of time
Definitely don’t mention dysphoria until you get in. The thing is, if they ban you for dysphoria that’s discrimination. You can make friends/ allies once you’re in the system that WILL stick up for you if someone is being discriminatory (it happened to me literally yesterday) but I wouldn’t chance it when you’re almost in. Get through basic training and then start the process"	m6zz45	NonBinary	2033	1.0	2021-03-17 13:06:55

I feel this on a spiritual level. Due to my current life circumstances I'm not able to present how I want to present all the time especially at work.

IDK who needs to hear this euphoric thought about beards and femininity. I was telling my sibling about my makeup-vs-beard-related dysphoria, they said “your beard line gives your face the daily structure feminine makeup strives for anyway”. 🥲 💕		"Yay. This is true! Facial hair is like contouring and can sharpen or soften cheeks, jawlines etc.
I did need to hear this, thank you! I also need to be either 10 years younger (so my beard isn't white) or 10 years older (so everything has gone grey). Until then, non-binary moustache is a winner too.
in fantasy fiction, forget which one, but dwarves are a race of beings that are super smart and crafty and down to earth. they also ALL have these huge bushy beards, and the men romanticize female beards like I imagine we romanticize traditionally feminine features
Bearded women, bearded enbies, and bearded men are all beautiful
Looks so soft! <3
Your beard looks so soft omg
I wish more females with polycystic ovarian syndrome (and other common causes of facial hair in women)that have facial hair would be open about it and leave it, so it would normalize it. So we would more commonly see it as feminine beauty. Thus making it more common for non-binary individuals. [Harmaam Kaur](https://youtu.be/rgQjfcpG7XY)
Not the video I was thinking of (where she names her beard and pampers it), but it will do.
Lovely beard on you as well.
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh tysm I have been struggling with rationally knowing that my beard =/= male but I think I just needed someone/something to say it out loud.  :))))) :OOOOO
oh i feel you bud, one time i shaved my beard off and looked in the mirror and _hated_ what i saw. it was even worse when i put makeup on.

beard softens features. still get called ""sir"" a lot, but whatever I live on TERF island.
I have always had some form of facial hair and as my face thins from losing weight and from micro dosing estrogen, I like the look of having some facial hair -- although, I dislike body hair and I have gone for a smooth look and feel with a few laser treatments. --  I am gender fluid and having both a smooth body and a little facial hair work great for me

😮
It's me, I'm the one who needs to hear that rn, thanks a ton
From what little I know about makeup, they aren't wrong. You look fantastic.
Beards can also be used for pondering, making you look wise.
*transmasc enby beard envy intensifies*
Oh wow, I wish I could grow this kind of beard
That’s very sweet, and beautifully supportive! ❤️
😲🤯🤩
I used to have massive mutton chop sideburns for this exact reason haha
Nice beard! It looks feirce with or without makeup ʘ‿ʘ
This is why im keepin mine until i do the big ol fem switcheroo :P
See. Listen. I don't give a fuck what anyone says. Beards are for men.

And women. And everyone else. ITS JUST HAIR YOU DICKS GET OVER YOURSELVES
You have a lovely beard too! Im still in my first year of testosterone and I hope mine comes out at least half as full
Can we talk about how perfect that beard is? Thanks.
I like when my partner keeps his beard very neatly trimmed over his mouth/lips area. I find it brings out a more feminine energy in his look. You look great though 🔥
I needed to hear this today. Thank you!
So true! It really contours your face and brings out your bone structure. I think you have a great a shape to your chin!
Your beard looks beautiful! I was born a female and can't grow facial hair, as a kid I always wanted a mustache for some reason, then I grew up and realized I was nonbinary
Its beautiful
Really is beautiful!
I like to think that beards are basically makeup! they can look really cool and masculine or really soft and feminine (and like anything in-between) depending on how you style ‘em :))
I shaved recently and I feel like my face looks a lot fatter without a beard. It does add a nice contour.
Precisely!! Glad someone else understands. I’m not out at work and so don’t wear makeup most days but this thought gives me joy when I see myself in my webcam
One of my roommates when I was just starting to come out as enby trans femme. Said “oh that beard shadow is going to be hard to hide”. Without thinking I responded “shhh it’s just built in contouring.”
I hear you! Though the gradients can be similar to the aim of the blending brush 💕
discworld!
Tolkien’s dwarf women have beards, and I love it!
I thought it was lord of the rings.
💕 💯
Thank you! It is! 💕
Thank you 💕
Yes! This! I love seeing cis women with visible facial hair, even if it’s peach fuzz, or a slight moustache, for that hairy femme solidarity. I have an enby friend with PCOS who leaves their facial hair and it is so beautiful and handsome. I cant. Thank you for the link will check it out now
I’m back, YES SHE IS THE BEARDY FEMME INSPO I NEEDED THANK YOU
omg yas
BEARD =/= MALE

BEARD =/= MALE

BEARD =/= MALE
That’s wild, yeah I’m kinda terrified of even trimming my beard or shaping the top line because I love my beard and I feel like it’s a part of my identity and I’m worried even grooming it will be a slippery slope towards a situation where I’m shaving every day to try and get closer to traditional feminine beauty standards. There wouldn’t be anything wrong with that if I didn’t love my beard, but I really do and I want to keep it. But yeah from what you’ve said maybe I will give shaving it a go bc maybe it will convince me even more strongly! But yes, with misgendering and feeling safer in toilets I think being beardless would be easier, but no way I wanna change who I really am and how I see my true self to fit gender norms, even if they are trans gender norms.
Awesome. I love the diversity there is in nonconforming hairiness. Thank you for sharing 💕
So happy to hear it 💕 I will pass on the thanks to my sib!
But yes I 100% relate to this
🥰
💕
Not just *look* wise, they also make you wise. And give you genderbending wizard skills.
Sending growing energy and love 💕

They are the most supportive human in my life
Aaaaa amazing I love this
Thank you so much my love 🥰
Excellent! Exciting stuff 💕
You had me in the first half 🥰
💕 thank you so much! Good luck with the growing!! 🥰
Omg thank you 🥲
Thank you! Yeah I like doing that too, but sometimes I just like keeping it more natural 🌱 💕
Have you seen this person? I think the beard adds so much https://www.wsj.com/video/eurovisions-bearded-lady-conchita-wurst/75B7D163-8F5D-4BD9-825B-26B4D570DC70.html
💕 I will pass on the thanks to my sib
Thanks so much 🥰 really appreciate that
Thank you! I’m sorry you can’t grow it, wish I could share mine with you 💕
Thanks hun 🥰
Thank you 🥰
Exactly! Love this
Interesting! Yeah definitely makes your cheekbones more prominent
Right? Whether it's with hair or pigment, you're altering the perception of your face. That's so cool and I'm glad it gives you joy! I really enjoy shaping my beard and stubble :) I also secretly enjoy that lots of people don't realise they're contouring when they're making their facial hair look on point and it's totally cool that everyone gets to enjoy that.
Oh brilliant! I might need to rethink my life a little, though I really like the s m o o t h.
Yessss
Oh awesome! Thanks I will have to read more!
I don't think so. There are other fantasy novels where female dwarves have beards, and in discworld they're not romanticised by the men at all. They don't even like gender expression, hence why female dwarves ate basically coming out at some point.
Thank you! It's coming along, slowly.
Would you look at that, all of the words in your comment are in alphabetical order.

I have checked 295,213,951 comments, and only 66,535 of them were in alphabetical order.
Your beard is *luscious* btw
I would never 😉
Yeah, I love the curves or curling parts on the sides 🤩
When I was an egg someone told me I looked like conchita and it made me so happy. Still thought I was cis though.
You're so sweet ty <3 but I've grown to like my face w/o beard with time, everyone is beautiful in their own way 💕
Fuck yes! Thank you for sharing that
I hear that, it’s part of my internal conflict too!!
Joy!
Awww thank you so much my lovely
Awww thank you!! 😘
I hear you, so happy that you see your true beauty 💕
Thank you, too, you've brightened my day :) On a related note, I recently had this breakthrough in understanding that it's okay to look traditionally masculine - cropped hair, body hair, facial hair - and still enjoy wearing feminine clothes. I realised the only reason I thought it looked jarring is because I'm not used to seeing it. I used to think I would have to shave to wear a dress, but no I love my hairy legs and chest and I look and feel great wearing a dress and that's totally cool.

Edit: And I know that's obvious, but wanted to share I've managed to rid myself of some prejudice!
I’m AFAB but I’ve always hated shaving so I haven’t in a few years. It’s been weird for me to show my legs and armpits until I got used to it to the point I don’t care. I stopped shaving before I realized I was NB but it’s still been a bit weird when I’m dressing sometimes. It’s all a process I guess
I will message you, I have a lot to say on this!!! 💕
I hear that. Thanks for sharing. Definitely a process. For me, it’s very variable and dependent on my levels of self confidence. When I’m feeling confident and esp when I’m with friends I can put on makeup no problem, but when I’m alone and feeling not so good it feels like an insurmountable task, my inner saboteur tells me it’s not “for me”, and I just get really frustrated with my lack of makeup skill. But I’m definitely having more of the former and less of the latter experience with time.
May I suggest you try putting on makeup when you’re feeling shitty and alone? I know it seems like an awful task, but you might feel much better by the end. And you don’t even need to do everything with makeup, maybe just do one thing like mascara or whatever else makes you happiest
Thanks, I have tried sometimes but it tends to make things worse if I do it when I’m already experiencing self disgust. I’m trying now to just build very subtle makeup into my morning routine so I can do it without thinking about it too much and get away with it on webcam, just to normalise it for myself
Sounds like a tinted lotion or BB cream might be perfect then? It wouldn’t be too obvious on webcam, and you’d get the benefits of lotion/spf too
Yes! Exactly. I need to buy something like that!
This is a reminder that you deserve good things. If you haven’t gotten your BB cream yet, I’m just reminding you that it’ll probably make you happy :)
💕 thank you so much. I haven’t yet - there’s a lot of things on my shopping list and it’s all quite daunting and emotional and I’m under a bit of financial stress. Hopefully next month
Do you mind letting me know when you do it? I really want you to be happy, and I have no problem waiting for you to buy it
💕 sure thing
Sweet. I look forward to hearing from you later on
I did it! I got colour-matched for the Fenty tinted moisturiser and I love it so much wearing it every day
Awesome!! I’m stoked for you <3"	q5uixa	NonBinary	1726	1.0	2021-10-11 12:13:47
F in the chat for this banger of an outfit that I can’t wear in public because of dysphoria, gonna share it here at least (featuring my dog)		"Big F cuz that looks amazing and you look amazing in it
Agh you’re all so nice :’) Maybe I’ll try wearing it out sometime haha
Exorcise me
First of all, wear that outfit as proud asyou can. you look soooo good in it and i love all of it.

Secondly, your dog looks like the fluffiest doggo possible
Damn you look great
I am shookith. I would like to cast you as the lead in the inevitable “The Craft” remake and your dog as a good boy from heaven.

Once I figure out a silloutte that makes me feel like myself, I might take a note out of your book and channel some witchy summer time realness.
Oh my god wow you look amazing
I think it looks amazing!!!
You look so great!!!!! You’re aesthetic is IMMACULATE I adore it! I hope you feel comfortable enough to wear it in public soon :)
If I saw u in public I'd be like 👀 (respectfully tho of course)
You are ROCKING IT 💛💜🖤
holy SHIT, everything about this is amazing. the boots, the jacket, your \*hair\*....just, wow. I'm really sorry abt your dysphoria man, that shit sucks :((
You look incredible
I love it! Where it loud and proud
aww you look awesome!
Omg you look stunning in that outfit!
That really is one banger of an outfit
Where did you get those shorts?

Also, obsessed w you tbh
Your whole vibe is insanely amazing. I love everything about it
u look so cool wtf!!!
This outfit is such a look. Seriously, you look fantastic!
you look great <3
If you don’t want to wear this out, hopefully you got some satisfaction out of sharing it with us because we’re all obviously very excited about it. You look lovely! A true banger. I love the white lacy thing (if u wanna share where you got it I for one would be very appreciative ~)
F  
you look amazing and your doggo is so cute!
gib outfit ༼ つ ◕‿◕ ༽つ
I wanna pet that dog... and also you're really cute...
The hair tho!!! On both of y’all!! 💙👌🏽
Hi I just wanna say that you’re a stunning person. Pretty sure you could cut glass with that jawline. 

Take it slow, friend: hormones, transition, certain clothing in public, etc. I know, it’s so fucking scary. You’ll be amazed though, the things that once seemed terrifying and impossible will soon be an afterthought that you’ll laugh about. Your confidence and gender euphoria are coming. Be well 💙
I feel like it needs something. Maybe a shorter back to the white robe. Like knee or thy length. 

Over all great look. Thx for posting
Your hair looks so cool mate! also this entire ensemble is so pretty!!
yesyesyes gothic regality
Your legs are so long 😭 you could model
omg that's so sick!! you legit look like a vampire hunter
oh my god I love this SO much you look so fucking cool
Love it!
You have so much leg and I’m honestly so envious of how pretty that outfit is and how stunning you are 🥺🥺🥺🥺
you look SO cute!!! i adore your hair
you look fuckin beautiful - like whoa & the dog is a definite plus, so cute
Your style is amazing! I hope you work up the courage to wear this out one day because I know that if I saw you in the street I would be so impressed with your style 😌
BRUH. You fuckin killed it. You have an impeccable sense of fashion. 👄👌🏽
Oh gosh, that is such a shame indeed, but I'm glad you've shared it! You're definitely in the ""would absolutely stop you in the street to shower you with compliments"" because that is? such a look? The black and white, the lace, the shoes, the cross pattern, the hair... everything! Everything is mindboggingly goth and I am so here for it? Let's have high tea in a quiet garden cemetery, sometimes.
You look stunning. I honestly wish I could look that 🤍
f is FOR amazingly stunning person
You look sooo great In that fit
Love the outfit! The dog is me though lol
Theres two absolute cuties in this pic! That outfit is absolutely amazing!
yeeeeeh i wish u could be transported w yr doggie to a nearby forest or field or beach cliff for some hibiscus tea..... a beautiful polaroid in the making

but rly tho u look wonderful and if u feel safe and comfortable i think the clouds and leaves would love to see yr grace
For what it's worth, if someone passed me on the street wearing that I'd be damn impressed, if not a little inspired. It's extremely stylish, and weirdly kind of regal. I seriously wish I had that good of fashion sense. Before I read the title I honestly thought it was from any of the selfie-based subs I follow, I never would have even considered any gender discrepancy if you hadn't mentioned it. 

I'm not going to tell you to just *not* listen to your dysphoria, because I know all too well that it's obviously not nearly that simple lol, but you should know that you honestly look fucking amazing, and I'm not just saying that. I'm genuinely envious of your whole style, and even besides the outfit you're frankly kinda gorgeous. 

You just keep being you! One day you'll really crack that shell and get out there more, and the world will be that much better off for it. I'm still working on that part myself, so believe me when I say it's not a race lol. Just, whatever you're doing, keep doing it, cause it sure as hell is working
That is exactly the vibe I want to give off / what I want people to think of my aesthetic haha
Ohh thank you haha! 
Its an honour for you to want to take notes from me, for what its worth the jacket thing and turtleneck are both from H&M and I just added a cross patch to it! I hope you can find a silhouette that feels comfortable for you sometime. :’)
I plan on adding some kind of headpiece to this, maybe a sunburst halo headpiece or something to REALLY drive in the aesthetic. Thank you very much also, I hope so too! Someday lmao.
Aw haha, that’s very sweet!
Thank yooouuuuu :’’) Hopefully it’ll get better soon or I’ll have a day when it isn’t as bad. Definitely want to play around with fashion more, because rn in public I’m Big Sweater Central
Aw, yeah I’m absolutely glad I posted here. Everyone has been so incredibly kind, its almost overwhelming (in a good way!). Thank you so much. :’)
The lace thing is from H&M! I got it pretty recently so it should still be on their website.
Aaahh this is so incredibly kind!!! Thank you so much! 
Things are definitely moving forward. I’ve started a low dose of T a few days ago, top surgery in about a year. Its moving forward, its an anxious but exciting time definitely. Looking forward to the day I can be more confident, and I definitely hope everyone else can be confident in themselves too. Thank you again, take care. :~)☁️✨
This is such an evocative compliment! Goodness, thank you so much!
A very ""Take me to Church -Hozier"" look
Oh my gosh that would be so cute! Hell yea!
It’s a very wholesome and supportive sub :) I’m glad it’s been a good internet experience!

And thank you for the lacy thing intel <3

The Duality of Dysphoria		"Hard relate
I feel very very called out with the first pic
I didn’t know other people felt pretty much the same way I do wow.
Daily conversations in my head for $200 please, Alex.
I think the obsession with validity is overrated. My focus is on rights etc, Even if I am just a boy who likes makeup and fancy shoes sometimes
Double Trouble, our lord and savior
Did you just reach into my brain and pull that first paragraph straight from there can we TALK ABOUT SHARED EXPERIENCES PLEASE
Relatable, but my ADHD makes me point out that was and were are not pronouns!
I want to steal their gender so bad
Good pic for the meme. Double Trouble always chooses chaos 😂

But yeah…. All too true.
Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe I'm in this picture and I don't know how to feel about it.
Double trouble was literally the cause of my realization that I'm non-binary they're the frickin best.
Literally me ever day even since I came as nonbinary.
Oh look, the most relatable character from a show I've never seen.
Only I get to say I'm not valid.
Me as genderfae 😭
Oh my god, this is so on the nose. Can I use it as my profile pic please?
I'm just starting to just Michael Jackson ""HEE HEE!"" when my friends hard ""he"" me LOL
In Double Trouble we trust 🫡
I was about to make a post that was going to be a really long version of what this meme summed up. 😂
Needed to see this, ty OP ❤️
aaargh  my brain
Feel that very much....especially the upper one
what animated series is that meme from? :o

looks interesting.
Jeez this is too relatable lmao
Was is also part tence 💔💔💔😭😭😭
Test
Fun isn't it.
Looks like I've stuck a chord with a ton of people, lol!

For everyone who's commenting and saying the self-doubt part of the meme mirrors their own inner turmoil, know that none of that makes you invalid. Just take a look at these comments - a *ton* of non-binary people experience impostor syndrome as well.

I think a lot of this is a symptom of existing in a transphobic society. If you have to filter your authentic self whenever you go out in public, and live as an identity that's not your own, then that's going to rub off on you, whether you want it to or not. The same goes for when other people ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" you all the time. If nobody takes you seriously, then it makes you question yourself, even if you ultimately know that you're valid. For me, when I have to be in boymode for a long time (like when I'm at work), that makes the self-doubting start. But when I'm around my queer friends, and can be my authentic, unfiltered self, then I feel non-binary as *fuck*.

So what can we do about all of this? First, I'd say try to find as many queer friends as you can. If you surround yourself with people who accept you as you are, it does wonders for your mental health. Find your local queer events/meetups, and go to them! If there aren't any, then start one (if you feel safe enough, of course)! Strike up a conversation with someone wearing queer pins, and maybe you'll gain an accepting friend!

And while that's a decent coping mechanism, we also have to solve the problem of experiencing transphobia in the first place. If it's safe for you, start being more assertive about your identity. Practice saying, ""Oh, I'm not a man/woman"", ""Actually, my pronouns are they/them,"" and so on in the mirror, until you feel confident enough to say it for real. Or, if you're not out yet, figure out where your friends/family/colleagues are on their journey towards accepting trans people. Start pushing them in the right direction, step by step. Not everyone will change, so don't waste your time on the backwards ones, but do try to help along those who are willing to listen.

If you're just complaining about things online, but you're not actively trying to make them better, then it's time to fix that. It's like having a giant pile of shit in your room, and saying, ""Gee, I sure wish someone would clean that shit up."" If nobody's cleaning it up, then you're going to keep smelling it until *you* clean it up. And if there is someone cleaning it up, well, it is a pretty big pile of shit - it's not fair for them to have to clean it up all on their own. They could definitely use your help with it, so why not help them, and lighten their load? Why not get a group of people to pitch in, so it's easier for all of you?

Our society is a giant pile of shit right now. We all have to do our part to make it better, so it's time to start doing yours. Start or join a queer advocacy group, if it's safe. If it's *not* safe, think about what you can do to get things to the point where it is. And it's not just about queer rights, of course - it's also about racial justice, womens' rights, workers' rights, environmental justice, animal liberation, and so on. A better world is not going to come about on its own, like an apple that falls from the tree when it is ripe - you have to **make** it fall. So get off reddit, go outside, and start making things better!

(This isn't aimed at you personally, I'm just replying here so everyone can see it)
dont forget that non binary doesnt mean you cant exist with part of the binary, you can still associate with being a man/woman while also not associating with it. gender is a made up construct and the way you experience it is solely defined by purely that. how you experience it. you can enjoy boymode while not feeling like you're a boy. non binie is simply existing outside of the binary in any way❤
With 8+ billion people in the world, it's pretty unlikely for any one person to have a completely unique struggle.
you are so right .  i am eternally fluctuating & have accepted that there's no resolution just one hell of a ride .  and if I am breathing,  I'm valid .  i always think of a parking pass ""do you validate parking?""  haha  Validated !
Both are important, imo. We need to tend to the mental health of our community, while also getting out in the streets and fighting for rights.
I love them so much.
Lmao, looks like I struck a chord with everyone. I don't check reddit very often, but sure, my DMs are open if you want to talk about the non-binary experience!
They will be, if the transphobes don't shut the hell up though.
well, that's not necessarily true. there's nothing stopping anyone from using them as xenopronouns or nounself pronouns
Of course, you don't even have to ask.
She-Ra and the Princesses of Power (2018). **Highly** recommend it, it's a fantastic show with tons of queer rep.
Like a merry-go-round of misery.
absolutely .  it's not necessarily ' neither' ...  for me it is BOTH
This is true... it's just sad that most of us will never meet our counterparts. It would be real nice not to be so alone in rl in these struggles...
I guess I should start looking at It that way
>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power

thanksies :)
I have a love hate relationship with my gender fluidity.
for me its man yes man no woman absolutely not none sure masculinity yes femininity yes 😂😂
hello .  nice to meet you .  .  it's a privilege to know other victorious enbys .   we are everywhere
If you have any local queer events or meetups, those are a good way to meet other people!
Victorious??? LOL. What gave you that idea? I am just existing, that's all. Far cry from ""success"". It's a weird world out there, and well... most people just make assumptions one way or the other. It's so weird because 99% of the population is just wrong on first glance, even the allys. Allys immediately assume I'm a transwoman and enemies immediately use everything to attack the male side. But what's weird is noone ever asks. Like I don't think even my pronouns have ever been asked before, they just make assumptions.
There isn't. And I don't like the term ""queer"" because I'm ace. There's a sexuality-related connotation. There used to be an LGBT+ group at my clinic but they closed because of COVID never to return. So once a year there's pride and last year was the first one I ever went to, and might be the last. I was so out of place...
even just surviving for me is a victory .  means I made it another day without punching my own ticket . so there's that
Biiig oof, you don't know how relatable that statement is. The fact that I always think that way is why I don't feel like a success, y'know? Which makes it so interesting that we came to different conclusions of what it meant lol. But I'm glad you are able to take a more positive approach than I am!"	12dndrh	NonBinary	1564	1.0	2023-04-06 15:15:25
I (22) came out to my boyfriend (24) as afab non-binary and he was fine with dating me until I told him I want to get a chest binder. (I also have no idea what flair to put for this post)	"First off, we’ve been together for a month. 

And I’ve explained to him that me having a female chest is causing major gender dysphoria and his response was “if you turn into a guy then that’s a deal breaker.” My bf obviously likes my chest while I hate it. EDIT to add: he also said “no don’t do that. I like your chest.” 

I may delete this post because I know the answer is obvious. I should break up with him if he doesn’t accept me. I’ve given him the weekend to process everything since I’ll be out of town. 

I just need advice.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for the advice. I just need to find a way to break up with him nicely. I’m sure I’ll find another partner eventually that accepts the real me.

EDIT 2: I was straightforward about why I broke up with him and he hasn’t responded. Which I expected. Even though I’m upset that I’m not in a relationship, I’m also happy because it wasn’t a good relationship in the first place. Again, thank you all for the help ❤️"	"Yeah, in your situation there isn't much else to do I believe. The guy is into women, and you are not a woman after some reflection, so it's understandable that it wouldn't fit together. Try and break up as amicably as you can -- you can probably stay friends. If that's any reassurance I'm certain you'll find another partner later who will take you as you are. I wish you well and I hope this goes as well as possible.
you're right on the money babe. find someone who likes you for *you* not the made up version of you they have in their head. if he's only ""fine with it"" if he can pretend you're cis, he's not actually fine with it at all (and you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)
The deal breaker comment alone would be enough to dump him for me. I get that people have their preferences,  but ""turn into a guy"" is a poor choice of words.
You absolutely can find folks who don’t just “tolerate” you and who don’t put themselves between you and what you want to do with your gender expression.

As for breaking up gently, I’m sure you’ve got this. Advice abounds, but just be clear about how you’re not willing to put him before your needs. This isn’t happening because you’re interested in binding or because you’re not a woman, it’s because you two don’t mesh and your boundaries are clashing.
you are who you are and you can't/shouldn't have to change it for a partner, but he's straight and into women, that's also nothing he can or should change. 

this is a situation where neither of you are right/wrong or anything, you just don't seem to be a good fit as a couple.
i’m sorry this happened to you. but i’m glad you’re taking care of yourself and ending it. in terms of doing it nicely, i would say just be straightforward and honest. “i like you, but i need to do what is best for me. if this is a dealbreaker for you, then i’m sorry, but this relationship isn’t right for me.” it sounds like he also doesn’t respect your terms/pronouns, if he insists on calling you his gf, so if you do want to maintain a friendship you might want to have a serious conversation about that. even if he doesn’t fully understand your gender identity, he needs to respect you. i also hope you can start binding to help with your dysphoria! i struggle with the same, binding helps a lot. ❤️
There's a lot of great responses here, but there's a couple of things I wanted to touch on and emphasize as someone who has been in a similar situation. You sound like you have things really figured out on your end, but in case anyone else needs this:

There's two things at play here:

1 - your boundaries and preferences, which deserve to be respected

2 - his boundaries and preferences, which deserve to be respected

The way I see it, people in relationships (regardless of romantic or not) negotiate these boundaries and preferences through communication, particularly ""I"" statements. We can't control what the other person does or wants, but we can state what we need to continue this voluntary relationship, and leave if these aren't met.

You did this - you trusted him with important, relevant information about who you are and how he can best respect you (terms like ""partner"" for instance).

What he did, from an outsider's perspective, is respond - not with ""I"" statements that communicated his boundaries in a respectful way - but with ""you"" statements and ultimatums, while ignoring your needs. IMHO, relationships shouldn't come down to ""do this or I'll leave."" It's much more like, ""This is what I need, and I'll be adult enough to communicate to you if this will no longer work for me.""

The difference is this:

""If you express your gender in this way, that's a deal-breaker.""

VS

""I like you a lot, but I only see myself in romantic relationships with people whose gender identity and expression matches that of a feminine woman. I am sorry that our needs and preferences no longer match up.""

Your gender identity, your expression, isn't the problem and should never be made to seem that way by a partner. The issue is that your have different wants and needs that no longer line up.

All of this is to say -- I'm sorry that you had to try to read the tea leaves of his thoughts and preferences and make this decision for him (though of course it's for you as well). This breakup should've probably come from him, with him communicating what he needed in response to your own communication, not him blasting past your needs, disrespecting your identity, to try to keep the relationship the same.

Anywho, that's my 2 cents as an internet stranger.
Dump his ass
You’re not transitioning to male just from wearing a chest binder lol wtf? Lots of nonbinary people wear binders without being full on FTM. 

I wear a binder during the day, and I enjoy my partner playing with my chest during sex (it feels good to me!) It’s a win-win arrangement for us. I think your bf is being unreasonable. I could see him drawing a line with top surgery, that seems reasonable, but a binder is literally just clothing.
I agree. Being with someone who doesn't accept the true you is worse then being alone. Just be safe and be honest, that's the best way to do it. Good luck 😌
I’m so very glad you broke up with this person (friendly internet hugs or high five) I was about to comment how it’s a serious red flag and he has a stipulation on who you are or are not “allowed” to be- but then re-read the edits :) I’m so so glad you found that out a month in and didn’t waste anymore time.

Especially where chests are involved. I like plastic surgery/conformation surgeries specifically and hate when people mod their chests due to what someone else likes or dislikes. Like you have to live with it and all the pros/cons it comes with
He was fine with your gender as long as je could ignore it. He wasn't fine with dating you, he was fine with imagining you were a cis woman then ignoring who you were entirely and using corrective measures to get you to conform to his vision. You aren't woman-lite. Glad you stood up for yourself and dropped him
Get rid! My partner met me when I identified as a trans man. I wasn’t transitioning any time soon and so was really distrustful of him even being with me (he was previously only with girls). 

He has stayed with me the whole time, only ever respected me, used he/him pronouns without question behind my back and to my face, and always called me boyfriend or partner on my request. I now realise I’m non-binary and he’s adjusted everything accordingly. The right partner is out there for you. 

You can’t really blame your partner for being straight - I can understand where he’s coming from. He didn’t sign up for you to not be a cis woman really. But then he isn’t the best person for you. Glad to read your update and I wish you all the best in the future! The right person for you is out there! Xx
Hi, I'm also afab nonbinary, just wanting to share my experiences with this. 

Due to my transphobic and homophobic fathers side of the family, I was very fearful of my identity and never tried to figure myself out. So I've always been nonbinary, but after a huge wave of dysphoria a few months ago I actually identified as enby and came out to one person, my boyfriend. 

He and I were together for 3 years before this, but it was still nerve wracking especially because he swore he was straight. I was scared shitless coming out to him, but after I did he accepted me. I told him I'm comfortable with any pronouns but mostly they/them. I cut my hair ""boy short"" and have been experimenting with it ever since. He refers to me in whichever ways I feel most comfortable and will say different terms for me that make me happy. He's since said that he's pan (but really is only attracted to me) and has made a lot of validating and progressive comments. 

So, I promise you there is (yes, even men) that will accept you and love you for who you are. I also want to start binding even though my chest is already ""small,"" and I just want you to know I understand. You are loved and you will continue to be loved more than ever. Best of luck, friend!
Just commenting to let you know that there are guys out there who will love you for you. I’m 23 afab non-binary and I came out to my cishet boyfriend about 6 months ago and he has been nothing but supportive. He uses my pronouns correctly and corrects other people (and myself even) when they use the wrong pronouns. He’s helped me find more masc clothing and given me advice on what mens-style clothing looks best on me. I can tell that he still really loves me deeply and supports me and my gender identity. So there is hope out there! You will find someone so stay positive!
Yeah, I think you made the right choice. He didn't love you, he loved your chest
Hi pal. I am afab non binary and married to a woman. My wife has always identified as gay and is not attracted to men in any way shape or form. I have always had severe gender dysphoria surrounding my chest as well. My wife is actually the person who first started talking to me about being non binary. I had no idea what it was until then. She suggested top surgery to me. I never thought about that before either. Due to finances, I can’t get top surgery very soon so she ordered me a chest binder. I’ve asked my wife how she feels about me being non binary and not being feminine at all, and she always says that I’m her person. She doesn’t care what gender I am. My point to you is, you WILL find your person too. Get the chest binder, you will not regret it.
If He's going to get upset about a binder he's clearly got more problems going on.
I broke up with my bf not long ago, but he was a huge boobs guy. I hate my chest, and I got a breast reduction a few years ago. Before I told him about the reduction, he always said that he liked me for who I was. BUT after he found out that I had a reduction, he couldn't let it go. He was obsessed, saying that if we have been together he would have tried to talk me out of it. He would fantasize over my old pictures, and make me feel terrible about myself even though I'm much more happy now. 
I honestly don't believe it's worth it. I gave him a chance, and I told him how much it hurt my feelings when he would say hurtful things like this. But eventually it got to be too much
Much love OP ❤️
Glad to read you put him in the bin where he belongs!!
if they don’t accept you for who you are and how you want to present yourself, then they’re not worth your time. you did the right thing, i wish u good luck on your journey👾
I get it. I (35 AFAB) am dating a man. Luckily he has no idea what being Agender means. But there are other issues to the relationship.    

I plan to leave and go on my own when I can. I have to save up first.
So I want to be clear about something.  While your Ex-BF may have not been nice about it, neither of you are wrong.  He doesn't have to be in a relationship with you if you're not what he likes/wants either physically or mentally.  AT the same time, you have a right to find someone who will love and respect you for who you are.  It was best that you ended things with him.
You're going to find someone who loves and celebrates you in all your enby glory! I'm glad you made room for it.

💛🤍🖤💜
OP people should love their partner no matter how they look. Think of it like this; he wouldn’t like you if you had to get them removed because of a medical reason. Even if that reason was your own peace of mind. He can’t even comprehend you doing the nonperminent solution, so that tells you how things would play out in the future if that is something you want.
Awww! I’m really impressed with you! You identified something that was not ok with you, identified when he said something that was essentially a red flag for controlling your identity, and then you found a way to exit that felt ok for you. I feel like I sucked at making any of those statements because I didn’t want to summarize anything in a way that didn’t feel authentic, but I also want to honor what you did because it’s really hard.

You deserve to be in relationships where your identity is cherished and supported. I would be incredibly sad if I broke up with someone and they didn’t respond too. It’s so hard to move forward with our that closure. 

❤️❤️❤️
A girlfriend I dated had a preference when it came to my hair. She liked that it was long and even though it was sometimes uncomfortable and i thought short hair looked better on me I liked it because she liked it. I cared more about what she liked on me then what I liked on me. I say “what I liked” but because she liked it I didn’t dislike it 🤔.. yuh know. If you care more about what you want different about yourself than what your boyfriend likes about you as you are then that’s cool but is that really the case. Obviously hair is much different so how about this. I’d love to have a vagina (this isn’t hypothetical) but if my girlfriend loves my penis I love the fact and even feel fortunate that I have one. I would think ugh what if I had a vagina then I’d want a penis because I’d know my girlfriend wants that more. Or if your girlfriend thinks you’re an ass wouldn’t you want to not be an ass or would you just be selfish and think “I’m just an asshole this is who I am”. Idk just something to think about 🤷‍♂️ wouldn’t you want to be what your boyfriend wants? Obviously to a certain extent. Like if if he want to be a druggy (hard drugs) and wants you to be one with him then of course but your chest?? I don’t really get what the big deal is and you broke up over it??
P.S. idk maybe I think this way because I’m a very submissive person.
May I commit physical violence?
Hey, I know you already solved the issue but I just want to say as a fellow afab non binary person that I am so proud of you for putting yourself first. Our identify is more important than any partner. You rock.
it’s been a month, break up with him
I think it is really harsh that just because you might wear a binder he would not date you anymore lol. Definitely not one to keep imo, you are not your chest and deserve someone who will like you no matter your chest ey.
All the best, and best wishes going forward.
Really happy to hear you felt safe/comfortable with getting out of a relationship that wasn't working out for you. You put your own happiness and wellbeing first, and that's something to be proud of.
i had a similar situation happen where my friends were dating the male didnt want his significant other to get top surgery. i would say break up with him. sometimes, as accepting as men may seem they may put that and simply use people to get what they want.
I had a similar situation a few months ago where my gf took an interest in a female coworker after I expressed that I was non-binary. She denied everything for months, until we were drunk one night and she said she’d just started identifying as lesbian and didn’t know where I fit into that. Just take your time with yourself and enjoy openly expressing yourself and exploring what makes you happy!
That sucks, but you did the right thing. Better a month wasted on the unworthy than years.
was going to comment then i saw your edits. you did the right thing, i’m around the same age & if someone won’t love you for who you are you don’t need them. i’m proud of you for sticking up for yourself!!
Imo if he presents you with the ultimatum of ""if you become a guy it's a deal breaker"" then he ain't it chief. I get it not everyone's on the spectrum but kinda shitty to be like ""you can't be who you want to be""
break up with him. y’all only been dating a month, not worth it.
I know this has already been dealt with my but I wanted to reinforce that the break up was smart! This exact same thing happened to me when I figured out I was some form of non-binary and started exploring my gender in high school. My at the time boyfriend (now ex) said he supported me but that he couldn’t date me if I ended up being a boy and that he didn’t like when I dressed masculine or even mentioned my dysphoria with my body. Well that ended up being one of the many red flags that I should’ve seen in the early relationship because he became abusive within 3 months of dating and I got stuck with him for a year and 5 months
Best of luck for you to find a better and accepting partner!
Yo this shit why it would take a miracle for me to date a cishet
First, ew. You did the right thing. It’s sad that he said what he did but telling someone that they like them for a part of them that they openly say causes discomfort is just freaking disgusting.

I hope you find people to surround you and affirm your identity. You deserve to present the way you want to, screw presenting to others. You had to do that crap for 16-18 years, you earned the right to be you.
I think breaking up with him was the right choice, but unless you were already digital/ldr then breaking up over message is pretty lame.
I'm glad you broke up with him! Even though he is straight I still think the way he responded wasn't right - you have a right to your own bodily autonomy even if it's something that he personally would rather you do different. I'm straight too and I like boobs more than anyone I've met but if my girlfriend wanted to wear a binder, I wouldn't stop her. It's her choice what to do with her body, just like it's your choice what you do with yours.
my spouse came out as non-binary before i did. i can’t imagine not being supportive of anything they feel, or them not being supportive of anything i feel. if this is causing a problem now, then he’s probably not going to change. find someone who loves you for you, no matter who you are or what you look like.
You've already made the right choice so I'll just say that you cannot hold it against yourself if they don't take it well. Block them if you need to, if it's best for you.
Congrats on the first step of moving on to discover someone who loves you more than the sum of your parts. I wish you all the best, because you deserve someone who can compromise and make concessions for your mental health and wellbeing. You deserve to be reassured and supported, and he wasn't doing that for you. I'm sorry.
Congratulations, and I’m sorry you had to go through that
im so proud of you for making the right decision!! take a biig hug from me (if you want one :3)
Even though the answer is obvious you just got to vent and have people behind your back agreeing with you and makes the situation so much better.
I’m so proud of you for putting your well-being first and not giving in to your ex’s pressure. You will find someone who loves and supports you completely, I guarantee it!!
Oh no after reading this and some of the comments I  just realized I might be in this exact situation right now
good for you for doing that, i know it will have been hard if you cared about him but you’ll be happier when you find someone who loves you the way you are :))
I’ve tried to date straight boys before, it’s not worth it
I can see I'm too late to change your mind and I'm probably going to be the only person with this opinion, but I think you should give your boyfriend some time before going for the nuclear option. I mean, a 1 month relationship isn't that big of a loss (in the scheme of things at least), but coming out as NB is a lot for a romantic partner to process and it's something you may have to do again in the future. When I came out to my wife, she found many different ways to express how repulsed she was by the idea of me being feminine. At one point, I remember complimenting her on a dress and her response was to put on this disgusted look and say, ""did you want to borrow it or something?"" That was about a year ago and, even though she still struggles with my gender identity, she becomes more accepting every day. Yesterday, she freely offered to go out with me in support when I told her I was nervous about wearing a dress to a concert I'm going to. It sounds like this guy may not have been *the one*, but one of these days, you might have someone really great that just needs some time.
You... broke up by text..?
Kinda arrived after the war, but just wanted to say congrats for breaking up. I'm very sorry it had to happen, truly, but I'm impressed you stood for yourself. I really hope it gets better for you!
Thanks. And I will. I’ll figure out a way to break up with him.
Yeah, I’ve thought about that too. Plus he refers  to me as “his girlfriend” and not “partner” like I want him to. And I agree with what you said, I (as many other enby’s) do deserve to have our gender celebrated and not tolerated. I just need to figure out a way to break up with him nicely.
It's not wrong for him to want to be with a woman, because that might just be what his orientation is. But pretending that the OP was a woman after they came out as NB is where he went wrong. If he wasn't okay with a partner who wasn't a woman, then he should have been up front with the OP and said that he didn't swing that way, rather than what he actually did.
>you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)

I like this
>(and you deserve to have your gender celebrated, not just tolerated)

Quote of the century right there.
These are the correct words.
I’ve found people who celebrate my sexuality but tolerate my gender, and people who tolerate my sexuality but celebrate my gender. You’re 100% right, and I hope someday I’ll find (or maybe have found!!!!) the one who does both.
It was for me too. And I know. While I prefer being mistaken as a guy I don’t want to fully transition into a guy. If that makes sense.
I know. 

And I did. I was straightforward about why I broke up with him but in a nice way.
It’s okay and I’m glad I’ve ended it. And thanks! I’m planning on ordering a chest binder this weekend but I’m not sure where to get one from. I’ve heard that GC2B are good ones.
I 100% agree with what you’re saying. It should’ve come from him but he continually misgendered me when I told him multiple times I didn’t like the term “girlfriend” and he wasn’t going to change then I decided enough was enough.
I did
I know. But I eventually want to get top surgery because I want a flat chest.
Thanks :)
Me too! (internet high five) 

And I eventually want to get top surgery but I’m going to wait till I’m financially stable and living on my own since I still live with my parents at the moment.
I’m glad I got rid of him and that’s so cool! I’m happy for you :) and I know.
Hey. And ah, I’m glad everything worked out for you! 

And I know I’ll find someone eventually. I’m also pan so I don’t really care who I date/marry. It just my ex refused to use the pronouns I wanted and stuff. And yeah. I know I’ll find someone eventually
Oh he definitely loved my chest and not me. His other response to me chest binding was “No don’t do that. I like your chest.” And that’s when I knew I needed to break up with him.
For sure. I’m glad I broke up with him.
I wish you luck and hope for you to be free ans independent soon!
I agree. And I eventually want to get them removed once I have enough money to do so.
Lol sure. I actually thought about that too 😂
I’m going to
I know lol
Thanks
I know. When he said that I decided I was going to break up with him. Which I did and I’m so happy I’m not with him anymore.
Yeah for sure. I also should’ve included this in my original text but he also said “No don’t do that. I like your boobs.” So that’s when I knew he liked my chest more than me. 

And I am. Thankfully my dad and siblings and friends accept me for who I am.
I know breaking up thru text is pretty lame. But our relationship was digital.
I’m glad too and yeah that makes sense. Like I get that he likes boobs, heck I’m pansexual, and I like boobs too but just not my own 😂  but the fact that he knew it caused me gender dysphoria and didn’t care was a red flag.
I know. And i did block him.
Thanks and it’s okay. At least I realized it a month and not any time later
Thanks! And I’ll take the hug :)
Oh no! Hope everything turns out alright for you
Yeah.
I don’t think I went for the nuclear option. I came out to him as non-binary before and he was okay with dating me UNTIL I said I’m getting a chest binder. That was the dealbreaker since he didn’t respect my decision and he liked my breasts more than me. So I broke up with him.
Yeah
If you're thinking of breaking up, just straight up tell him something like ""I think we're not compatible anymore, we have different values/views and continuing like this will not benefit either of us."" Preferably *in a public setting* to make sure you're safe. Don't get into a whole ""You hurt my feelings"" thing, it's very tempting but the mature way is the truth, and (based on his comments) the truth is that you guys just aren't compatible. You don't owe him or anyone else an explanation for why you're choosing yourself over a relationship that might not be serving you anymore.

Alternatively, (again in a public setting lol) you could try explaining more about Nonbinary people/the community/casually bring up any Nonbinary role models you have, watch Anthony Padilla's vid on NB people together lol, ect. If this is his first time hearing about all of this he probably has a lot to think about and needs both the information from you and time to himself to think about your relationship. Maybe it's not over, maybe you just need time, patience, and be willing to work together to figure this out as a team (NOT settle!). Again as long as you make sure you're safe, this is an option too.
Even if I’m with a cis person or a binary trans person I still hate the words “girlfriend” and “Boyfriend” partner is jsut the superior term ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
honestly he should know what's coming. you could start calling him your girlfriend until he gets tired of it :3 (this is a bad idea do not do this)
I was in your place a few years ago and I made the wrong choice (stayed with the asshole) out of fear that I couldn't get any better than someone tolerating my transness. Wasted 3 of the best years of my life with someone who treated me poorly.

Anyways, like 3 months after we broke up I met the person of my dreams and every day with him feels like a fairytale, he loves me and is proud to introduce me to his friends and family as his partner, and supports and respects my decisions and bodily autonomy. Been together over a year and a half now, planning on getting a place together in the next few months, depending.

What I'm trying to say is, your person is out there! Life is too short to waste on people that don't appreciate all of you. Don't settle for anything less than exactly what you want in a partner!
I had been with a supposedly young enby and they called me their ""girlfriend"" and it was upsetting. I have learned from dating or knowing many closeted and  not fully open sexual minorities since I have been out that you will only feel bad hiding who you are and as my therapist has said, some relationships do not survive a transition but that is true.
It does :) because you’re non binary. I’m the exact same in that respect. Means we don’t adhere to the binary- which male is. People can be so silly :/
Makes sense to me, I feel that honestly
gc2b binders are very good! i got my first binder from there, but unfortunately i have problems with my shoulders which makes it hard to get on/off, so i can't wear it anymore
My fiance has a couple. The black one fits better than the nude one they got even though they're the same size? It's odd. Just don't be afraid to go up or down a size if the first one isnt just right!
Hell yeah!
Had to comb the comments for this!! I literally cheered ❤️
Yeah. In that case sounds like y’all ultimately won’t be compatible
Aw that’s wonderful! Yeah it’s definitely really expensive. When you’re living on your own too, insurance might cover some of it? Something to look into. I’m so excited for you!!!
Thank you!
Alright! I’ll get me mallet!
Hence why I prefaced it with that lol, I understand in that case. It can’t be helped. You did what was necessary ❤️
Yeah maybe I just understand what it is like because I'm trans lol. I wouldn't want to cause someone that discomfort even if I liked that part of their body before.

I was actually kinda excited to grow boobs at first because that meant I would have a pair of boobs I could play with 24/7 (I was obsessed with boobs even back then) but when it happened I was like ""what the fuck is this"" because they actually caused me great dysphoria lmao.
\*hugg*
Well he broke up with me now so I guess it did turn right
That's... a very last resort thing to do
I agree. I prefer the term “partner” it’s nice to say lol.
I prefer the term joyfriend to partner. Partner is for marriage.
Ok but....lovefriend? Absolutely a lovely term to get called too, just feels SO good lmao~
Lol I thought about doing that. But I didn’t. I blocked him after he responded with “ok have a good life”
Similar boat, I settled for someone because I thought they were the best I could find as a non-binary person. They were asexual, I am not; I wasted almost 1.5 years.

Over 1.5 years later I’ve just found another enby who seems super promising. I really hope this ends up going well!!!
Cool :) and yeah, I know. Heck, my mom is convinced I’m trans when I’ve told her multiple times I’m not :/ my dad and siblings on the other hand are fine with me being non-binary.
Im planning on getting one from there. I need to email the GC2B support people to figure out my size. Since my chest size is bigger than my shoulder width I’m not sure which size to get.
Ah cool, that’s good to know. I’m also going to get the tank binder instead of the half binder, seems like it’ll fit better. And I may get two of two different sizes and see which one fits better.
Yep :) I’m happy and I’m going to order a chest binder this weekend :D
Yeah, hopefully my insurance will cover some of it. And yeah, I’m really looking forward to it :)
Lol I know :) and yeah. Hopefully I’ll find someone better in the future :)
*hugg* thanks :)
They were together a month. Hardly enough to warrant a large break up discussion. Text is very reasonable in this situation.
I'm personally fond of ""datemate""
My husband is absolutely wonderful about gender-neutral terms for me but I think I should have nipped ""snoogywoogums"" in the bud...
Awe that’s such a sweet name 🥺
Spouse is for marriage. I call my boyfriend my partner because we’re past boyfriend/girlfriend/joyfriend, we’ve been living together for years, but we’re not married yet.
Mmmm that’s quite dapper as well
You didnt have to block him.. he was gone. That's what have a good life means.
It’s such a weird thing- that when people learn one definition, they like stick to that a lot of the time, even if it doesn’t fit. It’s such an odd thing to me. Like partially trying to learn and be supportive but half not… 

It’s up to the individual. Like us. Me, I’m non binary and trans. You, you’re afab and non-binary :) both are equally valid. I’m very glad your dad and siblings are on board though, hopefully your mum will be soon too. Don’t see the point in insisting you’re something you’re not
yeah, i had that issue too. i'm fairly sure they recommend going with the larger size, but definitely email them to confirm!
I just want to reassure you they are the friendly staff ever. 

I had a problem thats taken weeks to solve (not their fault, my binder got lost in the Mexican mailing system) and they have offered me the best solutions and with great follow up.

10/10 for gc2b and my binder hasnt even arrived lol
Yeah they have tank ones. Not sure if they're made slightly differently or?
I’m happy for you. I wish you the best
I am so happy for you!!! Good for you for knowing what works and what does not! <3 I also love datemate as a term as someone said. Partner is good IMO bc it is gender neutral but then also I am like yes I am not straight haha.
I respectfully disagree. It leads to exactly this situation, where you aren't sure if they've read your message yet. Text is also a very bad medium for emotional stuff in general. It's cold. It wouldn't be an option to me personally even if we'd been together a week
Datemate is pretty cool! I'm a big fan of ""joyfriend"" personally
My name is Stevonnie.
I meant for me partner seems more serious than joyfriend or datefriend.
I mean he blocked me after he sent that so I did it back lol
So why does it matter?
Yeah I agree. 

And yeah, I know. And like I also want to do low-dose testosterone HRT to look more masculine. Plus It’s such a weird thing to explain to my mom lol.
I'm AMAB Nonbinary and I'm bisexual and polyamorous.
Ah. And yeah, I was planning on getting a size bigger but wanted to confirm with them first.
That’s cool! I emailed them a couple hours ago for advice on what size binder I should get. Should hear a response soon :)
Thank you!
Thanks! And haha yeah datemate is pretty cool too
ooooh I am liking both datemate and joyfriend! I personally ask my partners to call me ""babefriend"" lol
Oh I meant joyfriend, but hi Stevonnie~ I’m willow
Oh yeah, that’s fair!
40% of people like boobs and 40% like twinkies. Why would anyone be mad at anyone for this? Do you like one or the other? Some people like both. That's ok too. But why are you mad at this fella?
Aw that’s awesome!
oh yeah absolutely. good luck and i hope you enjoy your binder when it comes!
That's great! I'm sure they'll help :)
Hoi, Willow!
Partner is for when you're living together but you're not married yet. Two of my coworkers are gay men. Both are very outgoing and energetic guys. One is slightly more feminine than the other one.
Thanks! Whenever it arrives I’ll definitely post a pic here :)
Yeah :) I’ve been wanting to order a chest binder for a while and I’m super excited to finally order one

All it took was a haircut to combat the dysphoria. Damn I feel great! Before and after.		"It's amazing how sacred our hair is, not in that we shouldn't ever touch it, but how much power it has with our mental well being. Buzzing my hair was the best choice I ever made. I'm so happy you've found some peace through this simple act!!! 


💜🤍💛
To be fair the first picture looks also very handsome, but damn the after pictures look proper good 👌
I see a more confident person in the second photo.  Looks great.
Looking great OP! This might sound… odd, but as a fellow non binary person, I find it quite interesting how dysphoria  manifests itself. Like, for me, it’s my voice. I dunno, just find it interesting, even though dysphoria is awful.
Love that you are feeling great! You are killin' it!
1. You look fantastic in all pictures.
2. Your features are so good, and yeah, the buzz really lets your face speak.
3. Brings me so much warmth to see brown and black nonbinary joy <3
looks great :D
I shaved me head too! You look amazing!
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
You look incredible!
Wow! Both pics are smokin, but the second is straight fiyah!!!
Sometimes I think I grow my hair out just for the boost I get when I cut it all off again. Glad to hear your haircut has you feeling (and looking) great, too!
I shaved my head a year ago and I still remember the euphoria I felt in that moment that lasted a pretty long time. I’m so happy for you!! You look amazing!!!💙💙
Wow! That looks so good!!! Really gives off a What Is Gender vibe
You look good! I'm so glad for you. I'm hoping la chop will do the same for me.
You look STUNNING! I hope feel as good as you look!
(As in I hope you feel as happy as you look.)
Looking fly 👌🏼✨ I’m glad the dysphoria receded with the haircut!
LET'S GO
The earrings were great in the 1st picture, too
Whoa, you look so cool, I love your fashion sense in these pictures! Congrats on successfully fighting dysphoria too
amazing!
I cut my hair recently, too! It made me feel so much better. I'd been growing it because ??? Idek it's like me and being blonde lol. I get it in my head that I want to be blonde but within a couple months I'm like this is horrible. But yeah, it really helps with those funky feelings. (Also you look fantastic with the new cut, very androgyn and striking.)
HOLY CRAP THANK YALL SO MUCH FOR THE LOVE AND SUPPORT I COULD SERIOUSLY CRY!! And my first awards too! 😭😭yall are such beautiful humans and I appreciate each and every comment 🥰so much love radiating back to ya!
Yooo you the goat
Yo yaassssss!!
congrats!! it’s such a good feeling, i remember my first dramatic haircut, i balled haha 

i wish you the best of luck in your journey
congrats!! it’s such a good feeling, i remember my first dramatic haircut, i balled haha 

i wish you the best of luck in your journey
Looking awesome, but that shirt in the first pic is SO COOL!
You look so good in all of these but I know the power of a buzz cut well.  It's freeing and you feel so much more like you after.  So glad you're feeling better.  I just got fade cleaned up yesterday and I'm feeling more like me and least dysphoric too.
Absolutely! I had locs before too and that also came with its own set of energy. I think this new cut is definitely a pivotal moment and I can’t really see myself any other way.
Thank you!
Thank you! I certainly feel more confident
Yeah it’s an interesting thought for sure. Goes to show how diverse this community is
Thanks! That euphoria hits just right
Thank you! And yes, I love to see BIPOC queer/nonbinary joy as well 😍
Thanks!
Woohoooo shaved head gang! Thank you!
🙌🏽🙌🏽
Wow thank you so much!
Aww shucks, thank you!!! 🙈
Ha! That’s actually not a terrible idea to do every once in a while
Thank you so much! I’m still basking in it
Thank you! Tis the vibe I’m going for lol
Thank you! I hope that for you too
Thank you! I feel so good about my self and happier than I’ve been in a while ☺️
Thank you! Definitely a relief
Yeeessssss!!
They’re one of my favorite pair
Thank you so much!
😁😁
Thanks! Glad your haircut is helping you to feel better as well! Hair is such an interesting and personal thing. I love hearing about other people’s relationship to their hair
🐐🐐thank youuuu!!
☺️🙌🏽
Thank you! It’s an amazing feeling for sure. I didn’t cry but came pretty close and definitely felt all the emotions.
Thank you! Isn’t it a rad shirt!? It’s my latest thrift store find
Thank you! Yeah it’s mind boggling how that works. Glad to hear you’re feeling better as well
It's so you! Amazing."	tw6xpk	NonBinary	1357	1.0	2022-04-04 16:56:08
Struggling with dysphoria, so I made a comic about it [oc]		"This is really cute in a kind of sad way. I wish I had cactuses.
the baby rabbits one reminds me of that post from r/menwritingwomen about a guy comparing a boob to ""squeezing an obese rat"" lmao
The lego one got me all bricked up if you know what I mean
The Lego one is funny to me because sometimes when I forget my binder I think “Damn it, I forgot to take my boobs off” or “forgot to put my chest on”
I'm kind of vibing with the baby rabbits one, often I compare mine to weird chest mochi.
I *wish* it were like lego brinks! Would be *a lot* easier to deal with!
I like the Lego one. Can I have removable Lego tits? Lol.
!!Spoilers for Avas demon comic!!

Ava (and other characters) from Ava’s demon has a chest of drawers coming out of her chest/ as part of her actual chest and I am now only realising that I kept fixating on it due to “gender” envy
God i fucking hate my chest.
Been there im afraid as I am proud to admit ☺️
Lego's plural is still Lego
Be the Mantine of your dreams. Nothing can stop you, least of all your passengers.
baby rabbits Baby Rabbits BABY RABBITS
Well Legos are the best, cuz you can decide each morning *which boobas* you wear(that sounded horrible ik). Just stick legos under your ""things"", like idk, hot wheels, catuses, cats, a banana?, a car or idk. Frl gender suck
Be cool if they were like legos could pop them off and put them back on at will
I would prefer having two obese rats instead of having two obese boobs.

I made this comic about a holiday movie that has special significance in my trans journey, especially since this time of year is when many of us have to hide the most! What’s your favorite queer coded holiday movie?		"The image of Vixen from this movie has often come to mind in times when I’ve had to mask my true self to fit in. Sometimes it’s safer this way, but it always kills just a little bit inside… I long and live for places where I can just *exist* as the creature that I am—my natural habitat, with no need to hide. My heart goes out to everyone who has to hide part or all of who they are to make it through this holiday, or cannot be with their families because of who they are or who they love. Stay strong, fam! We’ll make it. ❤️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
That's so cute!! It works really well.

Did you know all of Santa's reindeer are either girls or trans boys? Both male and female reindeer grow antlers (not just males. It's a common misconception. Most horns and antlers appear in both sexes) Male deer lose their antlers in november (after mating) and female deer keep their antlers until may. Since Santa's reindeer have antlers at christmas they can't be cis boys. I love that fact
On my gosh, I loved this movie growing up, and this is such a brilliant way to represent dysphoria that I never even thought of ❤

I always loved the scene right before making the disguise. ""Take my socks off?""
Favorite queer coded Christmas movie would be Rudolph. It's been my favorite since I was a little kid and rewatching it's no wonder why.

Rudolph has to hide an unchangeable part of himself to fit in, and once people find out about that aspect of him they mock him and drive him away. Afterward he creates his own found family with Hermy and tries to find a place he can belong and where he won't be judged
[deleted]
❤️❤️❤️
I wouldn't say it's queer coded, but it makes for a good metaphor.
I can totally relate, its back to prentending to be cis while at the family get together hosted by some MAGA chucklefucks. 

The food is good though.
Just watched this movie tonight, by complete coincidence. Mrs. Claus is a trans icon in it too! She has a whole song about how she could do Santa's job, with a line something like ""I've fantasized about it often"". Oh, have you, Mrs. Claus?

Not to mention the Miser Brothers are about as queer-coded as you can possibly be in a Rankin-Bass claymation joint
Hearing people be so matter of fact about the damage done by ""masking"" always makes me feel better about being so fucked up from a lifetime of anti-autistic damage from the world around me. I don't WANT to mask. It's not good for me. I shouldn't have to pass as straight, as cis, or as allistic, nor should my primary concern in life be how upsetting my queerness (or autism) is for everyone around me to perceive.
I did know that actually!! Also, in other types of deer, while females don’t usually grow antlers, some does with higher than normal testosterone levels sometimes grow antlers too! Thanks for sharing this ☺️
Absolutely!! And the island of misfit toys, super meaningful to me. Love it!!
Tokyo Godfathers is the best Christmas movie I’ve ever seen
I believe Hana is also a trans woman, as she refers to herself as a woman (although others misgender her throughout the film.)
I LOVE this movie!!
Absolutely! Definitely picked that up when I watched it this past week!
Nature is so cool and interesting. Especially when you come across trans-affirming animals like reindeer, lions, hyenas and sea horses \^\^
Yes, exactly!
Absolutely!!
*damn nature you scary* 

Also there's types of aquatic snails that can fertilize their own eggs and start an entire population solo!"	ztlsrc	NonBinary	1257	1.0	2022-12-23 16:38:33
This is the first time in my life that I feel comfortable at the beach! Suck it dysphoria!		"You look great!! 😊
Nice briefs and nice hair style 👌

Is it the confidence? Is it the hair? The fit? The all the things? 

Maybe their born with it, maybe it’s EUPHORIA 🏳️‍🌈
Amazing! You look rad, I love the swimsuit, and love the hair even more

Representation is so powerful; this photo of you somehow really helps me to imagine myself going to the beach someday. It’s possible!!!

Thanks for sharing, I hope that you had an incredible time! Plus many more beach days in your future 💚✨
You look hawwwwt
Omg thank you and you're very welcome!! It makes me really happy knowing I gave you hope 🥺🥰 Everyone deserves to be comfortable in their own skin at the beach, and I know one day you'll feel that euphoria as well 💛🤍💜🖤"	phz0i4	NonBinary	1226	1.0	2021-09-04 20:28:32
i’m a recovering anorexic and experience both weight-related and gender-related body dysphoria but today i feel really comfortable and attractive and good and i just wanted to celebrate that with you guys ‘cause you get it. ❤️		"You look amazing!! 💛
You look so gorgeous!!
we have like the same body!
Beautiful indeed!
I struggled with eating disorders too. Thank you for sharing. It's tricky sometimes to try to separate if the dysphoria I'm feeling is more due to my gender or my other body issues. But for me, the more I accept my gender, the less I notice my other body issues. It gets better, is what I'm trying to say. Keep on keeping on.
i struggle with the same things. im recovering from an ED right now and it can be really exhausting to fight not just one but two different voices in my head telling me my body is wrong. so much of my disordered eating was fueled by my gender dysphoria (and vice versa) so sometimes it can be hard to separate the two. 

good on you OP, i know firsthand how hard it can be. i hope things look up for you :) you look great and you should feel great too
My gender-related body dysphoria is directly linked to my weight (bc ""curves"") and I've struggled to keep things on the right side of orthorexia-shading-to-anorexia ever since some well-intended fool told me that not eating would stop my period (like that was a bad thing!) so, yes, I absolutely get it. I'm so glad you're feeling good!
Heckin proud! Thank you for sharing your happy moments with us ❤️
Damn it. I thought *I* had the best username. I was mistaken.
I unfortunately know those struggles, but fortunately can be super empathetically stoked for you! *happy hugs* 💜
this chonky enby says YOU ARE VALID
you look awesome! keep going, you look amazing and I’m proud of you for getting through all that you have 💙
Hey, I’m going through this right now due to gender dysphoria too. My treatment team doesn’t seem to understand trans people but its nice to hear I’m not alone. I wish you all the best in your recovery!
I have the same issues, and I'd love a body like yours. Funny how that works.
Cute hair!
I feel this so much. for a long time I thought the only reason I wanted to look thinner was because I have weight-related issues and disordered eating but a lot of it is because I want to have a more feminine frame and an hourglass figure. I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with myself but I really admire your confidence in posting this!! you look fantastic and I'm glad you feel comfortable with yourself
I’m really struggling with the same thing
You look stunning!! So happy for you that you’re recovering <3
Shit you have an incredible body. It's so good you are beating anorexia. Keep being badass
Shit you have an incredible body. It's so good you are beating anorexia. Keep being badass
I feel you so hard friend. I’ve been struggling particularly hard lately and this just made me feel not so alone in that. Thank you ❤️
You’re absolutely beautiful/handsome!! I’m so proud if you! ❤️
whoa we’re like siblings! I have the same body type and am also recovering from disordered eating. isn’t it the worst how the tit situation hits on weight and body dysphoria at the same time? So proud of you for living your life in spite of everything that gets thrown at us!
I love your tattoos
Hey! I’m also recovering from an eating disorder myself. I’m going back to treatment for the third time but I’m still holding onto hope. I’m not glad we have eds but I’m glad we can relate as enbys with eds. Stay strong and hold onto hope! We got this! 💚💚💚
Thanks for sharing 🤩 you’re awesome!!
You look fantastic!
u look rlly nice uvu im glad you are recovering ♥️
Beautiful! You're amazing and wonderful!
Looking fucking stunning! 🙌🏻
I'm also recovered from two EDs, and I understand the struggle of battling with both dysphoria and dysmorphia. I can personally say that I am there with you and am so proud! Stay safe! <3
awesome tattoos! what are they?
You are so adorable. I’m also non binary and I suffer from an eating disorder as well. I’m doing pretty good and maintaining my weight as of right now. Hit me up if ya wanna talk.
But you’re adorable!
Wow you are truly really beautiful dude ❤️❤️❤️
You look amazing hun!
Seriously gorgeous proportions. Do you work out?
Congratulations and good luck on your recovery

My girlfriend said i should draw what i wish i looked like, that it might help my dysphoria. So... here it is. What do ya'll think?		"Fantastic drawing skills. One safety feature: you should tie your laces on your shoes/boots.
This is giving me Milo from treasure planet x Lara Croft tomb raider vibes and it's COOL

Edit: Atlantis, not Treasure Planet... I have disgraced my childhood
Love it!!! Your aesthetic reminds me of a super cool punk-influenced sci-fi adventurer. 10/10.
that you can draw really well
This is like punk Lara croft but more androgynous, love it! Also your drawing skills are neat.
How do you draw your hands?!
This warmed my heart, I love it! ❤ 😍 💖
Woah you look hella cool! I did a similar thing where I drew my ideal self and put it up in my wall with other positive affirmations for myself. It’s nice to have an image of your future self to look forward to. Well done!
wow your anatomy skills are amazing!! 
the person looks so amazing! im curious to know what hair colour you had in mind :D
Did you read my thoughts? That's very similar to what my mental picture looks like.
And jokes aside: you are very skilled with drawing/sketching. The picture looks amazing.
I 💜 them! You are an excellent artist :)
Damn that's not far off from where I am right now, except I have ibs instead of abs. I was only a little surprised that your avatar had green hair too lol
That's awesome! One thing you can definitely achieve is the hair. I say go for it
Goals tbh
Excellent artistry skill! The character looks great, too
I'm a sucker for the ol' tight top and lose bottoms combo. I def dig your image and I hope you can achieve and see this soon!
I love it!!!
Should I be getting gender envy from a drawing?
I love this
Milo Thatch's cooler non binary sibling
I call them perception drawings. And I think they really help with disphoria and self image, since they really put you and how you look into perspective. I do them a lot when I'm feeling sad or destructive. Really love what you did though and I hope it made me feel more whole!
Ah, I love your drawing (and same I wish I looked like them 😔)
I love this! I've been thinking of trying this as well but I'm kinda nervous for some reason lol, I think I'm afraid it would just make me feel worse about myself. What was your experience like making this / do you feel like it helped if you don't mind sharing? :)
Why are you so talented? It’s a masterpiece!
Wow this looks really good! Keep up the awesome art. <3
Looks frickin sick. I love it
Cool! I like it
I think you're an amazing character designer!
It's nice. I also think it's achievable. What's stopping you?
Ok now I'm gonna do this

Looks really cool! Your girlfriend sounds like a sweetheart
Damn I wish I could draw so I could draw what I wanna look like!
Ngl, this hits close to home for me because we apparently have a similar vision.
Love it!
This has hella NB vibes, but in a feasible manner
I know someone who has very similar vibes to this tbh, it's 100% doable (and very attractive)
Gives me a borderlands character vibe. I love it!

Ooh i did one of these a while ago, ver pretty
I will consider it... no promises though
Thanks very much! Was rather chuffed with this :) now i just need to lose some height, weight and shoulder width 🤣
Milo is from Atlantis and I 100% agree. The art style is very similar too
Jim Hawkins is the guy from treasure planet. I've watched it about 10 times this week because I put it on for my kid lol.
That was the blurb i wanted! Thank you so much!
Thank you. :D I think I'm ok at best 🤣
Thank you very much! I grew up with Tomb Raider on the ps1 so thats lovely to hear.
A lot of practice and staring at your hand in weird positions!
And you warmed mine! Thank you 😁
Thank you! Its why im getting up at 5am before work to do yoga and other fitness 🤣
Oof i haven't decided. I change mine a hella lot. Its currently puple to blue. I think like a neon pink. I moss having pink hair.
Thank you so much ❤
You are far too kind. Thank you :)
My hair irl is currently blue but last month was a lush, forest green. 

You are where i want to be! Hope i can catch up 💪
Thank you! My hair is currently a little past my shoulders with an undercut on the sides. Started as a Talesin Jaffe and now its punk Elsa
Literally in my case. Gotta belly to shift first!
Thank you so much ❤
Thank you very much! Me too!
Thank you
Ha! No but i will admit i get gender envy at EVERY character creation screen so... who am i to judge?

I'm sure you're lovely however you are 💚
Thank you very much
Thank you 😬
It really did. Im glad im not the only one too! Its currently on my wall as inspiration. Gets me out of bed at 5am for cardio before work
Me too! Im using itvas inspiration
Yeah i think it did.

I recently did a lot of exploring in an RPG called Mothership where i played a character who was brain-transplanted into a cyborg, ala Ghost in the Shell.

When i came out to my friend, he replied ""WERE WE EXPLORING SOMETHING IN MOTHERSHIP""

This was the next step, and i think its helped getting it out of my head and onto paper if that makes sense.
Its less talent and more years and years of practice! Thank you :)
Thank you :) i will
Thankyou so much
Thanks :)
That is the sweetest thing
The big belly and hairy body. But ive started yoga every day so hopefully one day ill get there
She really is. 💚

You totally should! I'd love to see it
Practice makes progress
No denying style and grace 💚
Thank you 💚
Hope i can get there
Gives me hope
Thank you 💚
Hahahahaha! 

Love it
Thank you very much ❤❤
Thank you 💚
Thanks. I do tak some inspiration from that style
My bad!!!!!
then you haven't seen my horrendous lack of skill yet
Fair point!! Lol I use my hand as reference too so I feel that
So i usually start by deciding how i want the hand by placing the wrist and palm/back of the hand. I then use 3 cylinders for each segment of finger and two for thumb.

Then its all smoothing and detail. 

Greenmanpaints is my insta where i have some of my painted minis and doodles
that sounds so fricking cool!! the weird thing is, i had pink in my mind too! you sound like a super cool person, honestly!! 
i hope that you can have pink hair again!
Np
Oh, I don't know who that is!
No problem
Hey, if you can draw a square, circle and triangle you can do anything
I’ve stared at my and other hands so much they have lost all meaning to me anymore 💀
Oh my sister wants it pink for her wedding. Her 6'3"", bearded, pink haired, amab sibling. Walker her down the aisle.
*it as

Apologies. Im using it as inspiration to work hard and get the body i wish i had
...

does with compass and straightedge count? Because freehand no.
OMG THAT SOUNDS SO AMAZING!! you're going to look so cool!! 
all the best to your sister! ((and to you of course!))
Ah, no worries, I thought it was just a character I didn't know about 😅
Yes. Yes it does. Architectural and design are just as important and valid as freehand.
💚 you wonderful person 💚
Well its my next RPG name so i guess now it is! I may even post when i draw them
then i retract my statement, i know my geometry
Damn, that's a cool name tbh. Hope you have fun 👍

Wearing masks has actually done wonders for my dysphoria. Anyone else?		"Agreed I work at a bar and dress the way I want to dress as a non-binary fem and they call me hun,miss,and luv <3
Yes I love them now
I don't have to look at my stubble.
Yes, as an afab enby it’s great to not hear people tell me to smile because I look prettier when I smile

Leave my resting bitch face alone people!
I just love getting to hide my acne at work lol

and sometimes it's nice to not be so ""out there"" by covering your face, ya know?
yep! love them.  i have facial piercings and a tongue split and i always used to love to show them off, but i actually don't even miss that aspect of things anymore.  the mask is the best.  now it's even more of a shocker if the mask slips a bit and one piercing pops out.  ""HAVE YOU HAD THOSE THE WHOLE TIME?!?!""  they say! lolol .  its the best.    


i also like to pretend sometimes its a beard.
""nobody look at me"" -the entire population of the gender expression that keeps getting accused of begging for attention
Yep, my parents are getting worried cuz I'm so comfy with them lmfao
Yes! I hope it stays socially acceptable to wear a mask even after the pandemic is done. They are just such a comfort blanket now
Yes ! It's one of the few times I wasn't immediately assumed to be a cis woman
yes! i look much more androgynous with a mask on, and it makes me so happy! :)
Yes i love it
Oh god yes!
It’s a life saver
yesss, it stucks still getting misgendered when i have one on but at least i feel better about myself
My chin and mouth has always given me the most dysphoria other than chest! Mask is staying on 5ever
Yes people get confused so often. My haircut helps though too
Same!❤
I agree!!! You are very beautiful btw, I'm sure on the inside and out :)
Right? It's fantastic.
just saying but with that background art it looks like you have a halo of hearts and that is the most fitting thing
Sameee
Sadly not my dysphoria just comes from my chest and stomach
Yess! I'm just disappointed that I can't show off my piercings lol
yeah i also wear a eye mask too so my whole face is covered but since everything is going back to normal noone is in a mask but me and my friends keep trying to get me to take the mask off and i feel weird because im alittle dysphoric with my jaw and chin also my forehead
Same
hard agree! it helps while am under laser facial removal
Pair it with sunglasses and a hat and I'm a full on DUDE. I love when people can't tell what my gender is. 'Tis bliss
yup ! i get gendered correctly more often with it on too :)
Very much yes.

Also why should I stop wearing it after this is done? It makes me look mysterious.
Aahh, people keep confusing me for a woman (long hair) and then get really confused. Always fun.
Yess it hides my small chin and awkward HRT puberty scruff growing in at age 31 lol
Yes I'm keeping it forever and ever
Yesss same sorry you are feeling dysphoric!
Yeah the biggest source of dysphoria for me is facial stubble
Same, i even wear them during athletics
Me too! Maybe I’m just lucky but I haven’t had a stranger tell me to smile since we all started masking up
lol

lol
Same. It does kinda suck when people still just see my afab ass as a cis woman. Cut my hair super short, bind, wear a mask, and I still get called maam.
Same here!!
Ugh, I’m sorry you’re being misgendered :/ I’m in the same boat and it is so discouraging sometimes"	mwysm7	NonBinary	1104	1.0	2021-04-23 16:12:48
Working on my confidence and through a heavy bout of dysphoria. Just kind of...trying to feel more comfortable. How bad do I look?		"I think you look good; I really like your skirt.
You don’t look bad at all! Something that’s been very empowering for me is to find what styles and shapes work best for my body shape. Have you gone very far into fashion?
The question should always be ""how good do YOU feel?. :) That's all that matters.
How bad do you look? You gotta knock this self-depreciating shit off. You look great! Do you feel good? That’s what matters, friend! 

What’s the orange top look like with the skirt? The zip-up fleece, while comfortable and snuggly, covers up that bangin’ orange.
You look great! Btw, I have the same shape as you do and I highly recommend looking into a line & panel skirts you can wear high waisted. (Like the first skirt)

I feel like I can move more freely in them personally, and it's a lot easier to make a basic top really cute when your skirt is covering up the bottom half of it. 
 
When you get to a point where you are buying clothes, it's a really good investment and we'll make your closet really versatile.
Gorgeous omf
How bad do you look? You look great.
I think you're adorable!!😍 if that's a comfortable word for you, of course. Thanks for vulnerable sharing!!
you look amazing! it takes a great deal of confidence to express yourself in ways that make you feel good. in itself, it’s an act of self love and appreciation. keep being you!
Bro top says dilf and bottom says milf you got that style on lock
You look great in a skirt!
[deleted]
You look amazing
Honey you're lovely
You look awesome
it’s giving nonbinary and i love the skirt. long skirts are rad!!
I love that seafoam/mint skirt on you. Looking at the second photo, I think you’d look great in like an a-line dress about the same length with a shirred strapless bodice, in the same color.
You don't look bad at all, you look marvelous!
You look so cute! The light gray looks airy and happy and the dark gray looks badass and commanding (?) sorta like you mean business.

Very good comfy look 👍🏿
I honestly think you look fantastic. You were made for that type of skirt- it’s super flattering!!
the first outfit is probably my favorite, the pastels look very cute on you! maybe a nice hat or some jewelry to accessorize?
Me and my spouse think you look lovely! 😊 growing confidence is your task. I wouldn't worry about others who aren't you.
Imposing stance, I feel like you should be holding a lightsaber to really accentuate your commanding presence, may the force be with you brave Jedi
Absotively, posolutely adorable.
You look really good, and the outfits are nice - I think the first one especially is really cute. 🥰💚
Need a cuter jacket to complete the look
Beautiful
You look great! As long as you feel good :) totally rocking it, wishing you the best in your journey !
I like the skirt! A rule of thumb I always keep in mind for myself is if it brings you euphoria, wear it❤️
You look awesome. I’m especially a fan of the first outfit bc of the silhouette the flared skirt creates but you look lovely in all the skirts :))
0%

Honestly how happy you look in the outfit gives you a radiant quality
You don't look bad at all, you look like you're rocking both outfits. <3
You look great! I'm a big fan of long skirts. I saw in a reply to another person that you don't have the means to get much new stuff at the moment, so if you still want to experiment my suggestion is experiment with the colors you have! A good color combo can elevate a fit so much
Looking great~
Rad
You look great!!!! Long skirts are my fav🥰
Fine af! Yasssss! Werk! Don't let hegemony define you excellence and beauty.
OP you’re killing it and you look like a friend. The only thing getting in your way now is that lack of confidence! Hopefully the outpouring of support from the community could be a little push to help you on your way :) Dysphoria really sucks but you’re doing great! I find when I’m having dysphoria part of the battle is just accepting it’s happening so I can take steps to make myself more comfortable, so you’re already part of the way there.
You look wonderful. ❤️
The way you stick out your hands makes it funny. But looks great on you :)
you look amazing sweetie <3
U LOOK GREAT OMFGGG
You look wonderful :)
You look great!! Love the long skirts 🌟
You don't look bad, love! You look comfy in what appears to be a very soft and luxurious skirt. I'm sure it makes very satisfying *swish swish* noises when you walk. 

You look like you're trying something new, which is scary, but it's totally worth doing. And that makes you gorgeous. :)
You look great!
You look good, my only suggestion would be to tuck the t-shirt in and maybe invest in big knitted cardigan instead of a hoodie/fleece. It’s sometimes warmer but personally I feel they fit skirts more and are a lot easier to chuck on on a bad day as you can wear them loose and open or close them and put a belt round your waist 

Honestly though I know how hard it can be when you have dysphoria and you just want to cover up, and I really hope you’re feeling better soon, but in the meantime just look after yourself and make sure you stay hydrated
I think it’s the beginning of something great. Do whatever you want to make yourself more confident with it. I personally think you would rock a badass kilt like no one else
You look beautiful! Those colors really look nice on you! Keep it up 😊
You don't look bad. You just look unhappy.

But you are rocking that outfit and I hope that it makes you happy inside. Wear it again, and again, and again. <3
Love that first skirt! There are lots of fashion subs on here, maybe someone here knows one that's particularly lgbt friendly (to avoid the trolls, they always appear)
Also, for finding clothes sites like vinted or depop are good for cheap pretty clothes. Also make some mood boards on sites like Pinterest to find some style inspiration! Find the colours you like, shapes you want to try etc :)
Your skirts are a whole vibe, looking good!
You look pretty good to me.
i love ittt you look amazing
Hold on, stop right there ✋ you look freaking fabulous. It’s like that skirt was made for you!
The blouse and skirt fabrics are sooo beautiful. 😭 They look very soft and comfy. “Bad” isn’t even in the vocab of look book, here; you’re allowed to know you look stellar, friend. 💕 I’m so sorry you’re struggling with dysphoria. I can relate, lately. Personally I’ve been reminding myself that my worth isn’t tied to the way I myself or others perceive my beauty. I have sensory experiences in this body that bring me immense joy. I curate things as much as possible so I’m able to be gentle with myself. You’re worthy of the softness you put into the world. ✨☀️🌸
Afab here! I like all the skirts but the first one the most! Consider tucking your shirt in the skirt as it's high waisted as a change if you feel like it! Also not sure where you are from but I shop a lot at depop and vinted (in the uk) and vinted even has this option to look from low to high price and there are items for 1pound. You just need to weed through a bunch of bad quality things. I am sure there are similar apps. I am quite broke and find good deals like that, or charity shops. Not sure if any of this is helpful but hey, good to say it either way!
You honestly look really cute.
i love those skirts on you! you look very sweet. x
You look great! Honestly so cute!
Fantastic — the pale green skirt is so cute with that jacket!!
You look so darn gooood. For real the outfit looks amazing on you and you have such a friendly face my first reaction was to ask for a hug. 

You look stunning, keep doing what you do✨
Genuinely, you look really nice. You rock! Wear them if that's what you want.

&#x200B;

btw it looks super spinny :D You pull off that look well!
I am not much of a fashion person. I am a jeans and tshirt lady.  But it appears too drab/grey... I would add some colour. Maybe I just hate grey.  Maybe something like a scarf with colour. Also if you will mix the same colour, try to match the tone. Some advice I got given once.  Anyways. Enjoy your skirt!! Skirts can rock, especially in the summer.
you look amazing!! i love this look 💕
Have you tried ""skirt go spinny""? I hear that can help with some of the bad feelings.  


But seriously, you look good. And warm!
I would suggest pairing this skirt with a zipperless hoodie and tucking the shirt in. I think this is a good color for you though
You are super cute!
How bad do you look? Well I'd personally say that you don't look bad at all and are in fact rocking that skirt.
A bit of advice. Do you like the hoody or do you like that it hides your tummy? The top looks cute and I like the color. If the hoody is just there to feed the dysphoria, I suggest taking it away. I wore too many hoodys to the point of hiding my best outfits. I stopped and much of the dysphoria went with it.

Skirts and leggings are really valid, and you wear it well.

You look clean and well groomed. 

Anyone who isn't hung up on traditional standards should be thinking you're pretty cute.
You look great! AND comfy 🥰
Drip
You don’t look bad. I do think your outfits would more flattering if you matched the weights and textures of fabrics.

Your skirts and blouses look very nice and structured. The hoodie and the fleece are somewhat unstructured and (for my taste) do not fit in. I recommend instead looking into a blazer, a cardigan or a tunic, whichever you prefer. They would dress up your outfits.
I thought your armchair was a vacuum lol

You look like you’re nervous but that’s okay this stuff can be scary it’s all chill

You got good taste in skirts! I like the last two photos the most because it looks like you’re having fun

By the way, if you want any advice (sorry if you don’t), try taking photos from above, looking down at you. Tends to be a more flattering angle, particularly if you want to emphasise femininity

Also a light source behind the camera (facing you) will allow for a softer look and less ISO noise
Dress and hoodie combo is 👌*chef's kiss* definitely my favorite thing to wear when I wanna dress fem but still feel ambiguous and comfy
YOU LOOK SO AMAZING AND PRETTY /P
i love your skirt SO MUCH AAA 
on a side note, ik it's really hard to go through dysphoria, but you'll get through it <3
Those skirts are really cute and look comfy! I also like the color of your shirts because they complement your skin tone. 
Main problem with your outfits how the jackets create an unflattering line with the skirts. Especially since the shirt is peaking out underneath between the hoodie and skirt.
You look amazing!
It lacks pockets, but it's weirdly warmer than some of the pants I own!
I honestly haven't been able to venture much into fashion. I mean, I have a couple cute tops, but really fashionable stuff, even cheap stuff, is out of my price range at the moment, sadly. For now, my wardrobe consists of a lot of feminine-shaped button-ups. :/
You're not wrong. And to answer that question: I feel pretty darn good right now!
The lighting is actually pretty garbage in my living room--the shirt is actually purple lol. And, like I said, I'm working on confidence and being comfortable, but it's a long road for me.
Yesss those are so cute.

I love the mint in the first pic, looks great with OP’s hair color
Thank you!!!
It is strictly because I live alone that I can dress like this at home
I have a really cute peacoat, but the fleece jacket is strictly for comfort and warmth
r/enbyfashionadvice and r/nonbinaryfashion !!
Long skirts with leggings/warm tights can be warm!
I understand that. Finding skirts that are cute AND have pockets can be a difficult task. Looking good though, and maybe the right jacket can make up for a lack of pockets.
I only wear skirts on rainy days cause the warm outweighs the dysphoria. Sadly with snow it would get on my legs so no go there.
I totally hear you on cost, going out and getting new things can be tough in budget. There are a ton of creative options though like thrifting or repurposing skirts into dresses, etc. 
What kind of blouses do you have? 

You have a great pair of legs and those long skirts are hiding them. Look into styles like Empire waist, wrap dresses, A Line, higher waist - so this would naturally sit right under your chest and flow out. Dresses should stop about like an inch or two above your knee, or more 😉 depending how much leg you want to show. 

Do your skirts have elastic in the waist? You can bring skirts like that all the way up to your chest and use a small cute belt under the chest to create a waist. Gives you more leg and shape. 

Layers are great, too. Cute denim jacket (especially over a dress) or a jacket that have cinching right under the chest, helps to create more shapes. Creating different shapes with your body and drawing your eyes to the areas you want to show off. Sounds counterintuitive but it can work wonders!
Do you know how to sew? Skirts are a good starting project though cloth can eat your budget if you can't find what you want at a second hand store. Can be nice for modifying second hand clothes though. Dress something up or add darts to make it fit better.
No troubles! Of course it’s all about confidence and so it helps to feel good and put your self up. Ya know? For what it’s worth I think you look great in a skirt and if it brings you joy that’s what matters. ☺️
Oh God is this The Dress all over again lol
We should start a hand made clothing shop for skirts with pockets. And special sizes if needed.
Many denim skirts have pockets but usually shorter pockets than what most men's clothes have.
I personally really hate empire waists, as they emphasize my gut. I have some very vivid memories of having to wear an empire waist dress and thinking I looked pregnant. No me gusta.
That’s great to know! Figuring what works best for you and what makes you most confident is what is important! I’ll gladly help if I can. 🙂"	segi9w	NonBinary	1070	0.99	2022-01-28 03:04:36
Okay i am a closeted demiboy, i still am a girl to most people and starlight is coming up and i dont feel like being in a pit of dysphoria. Should i wear the Tetris suit?		"""should i wear this tetris suit"" is a solid resounding yes regardless of the context
I have no idea what starlight is, but you should definitely wear the Tetris suit!
I think it'll ""fit"" you haha!
I want the tetris suit
If I met a person that was interested in me wearing that suit I would marry them.  Hell yes get it.
I love this suit
this is the way
Do it! I love looking back at photos of fun or zany things I wore at school dances, makes for great memories.
100% wear the tetris suit
YESSSSS!!!!!!!!
Absolutely!!
I love this store. The clothing makes me feel pretty freaking handsome… yet it’s cut so your curves can be dealt with. [wildfang](https://www.wildfang.com/) lots of fun stuff here too! Maybe mom will see something nice to surprise you with :-)
""Should i wear the tetris suit?"" is such a powerful sentence. Like it sounds like the powerful invocation a wizard would utter in the eleventh hour of a fantasy epic. Like i kinda wanna make a DnD character who says it in order to cast their most powerful spell. In fact, i very well might just take this outfit idea if my NB Paladin lives long enough to go to a formal event.

The only thing more powerful is the more confident, affirmative ""i *will* wear the Tetris Suit!""

If that whole thing wasnt clear enough, yes. Find the NB Paladin/wizard/whatever inside yourself and don the Tetris Suit (if you feel like you'd be safe wearing it)
Yes I love it lol
Yesssss this is rad
Do it! Do it for the meme even if for no other reason.
Yes a thousand times yes
Yes
yes, no question
U could casually use colors from ur flags colors in ur fit as well🥲 now I wanna do that but my schools VERY homophobic and transphobic lol
Treat YoSelf
It looks awesome to me!
100% you should wear the Tetris suit!
Definitely wear it!!! You will look amazing I'm sure. 
But if possible avoid getting from Amazon... Is there any way you can try find it elsewhere?
I think every single person should wear the Tetris suit. How did you find this, it’s fantastic
Dance in it, lounge in it, get married in it, or be buried in it. That suit is perfection and should be worn at every event possible. Dare I say it's....suitable for all occasions?
YES. 

Please, please wear the Tetris suit. It is amazing. 

Also, suits make everyone hotter, regardless of gender.
No matter what happens. You can never go wrong In the Tetris suit
U should wear it and post a pic of u wearing it on the sub if you want  :DD
Hell yes my guy that honestly slaps, I'd wear that in a heartbeat. It's a similar vibe to an arcade carpet pattern suit I saw once (which I would also wear)
Not if you're doing it to find your missing piece/s
Or just to fit in/s


Yeah totally!!! It's very rad!
Dude I want that do you have the linnnmkkkkkk

And the answer to your question is Yes absolutely
I don't know what starlight is, but that suit is fire! Absolutely wear it to anything and everything

Aw thank you so much!
Thanks person*
😎
i wore a suit just like this to prom, it was the same company but it was covered in TV test screens. i was partially out at school but not really 💜
yeaaa, i always thought of myself as a guy but around a year ago i had a lot of questioning my gender and even wondering if i’m a trans girl, but i pretty much settled on a demiboy cause i don’t think of myself as very masculine but at the same time i don’t feel like i’d be anything else
🤠
WHAT!!! That sounds so radical
Same!!!! I want to present genderless but dont mind he pronouns but slightly feminine
💪🌝💪
it was so cool to wear!! most people didn’t care to know what it was but i took A/V my senior year and so i wanted to honor it since i was only able to take one year of it and i was so sad i wasn’t able to take more
samee
💅😊💅
Wear it to the store! It sounds amazing, i hope people wont care at my school🤞
#FagProplems
👉😧👈
LOL
✌😚✌
Glue kind of tastes like soap
🤞🥲🤞
hm well lightbulbs don’t taste like a whole lot (true story)
🤘😝🤘
If you dont mind, can i have a back story?
so basically my family had a garage sale when i was a kid (a couple actually but this one in particular) and the night before i went into my garage and saw that we had some light bulbs laying around, so i just went up to it and ate one, and i really don’t remember much of any of it cause i was 3 or 4 but i had to go to the hospital.  i’m perfectly fine now tho
Did you get cut? I have no childhood story that can even compares to that.
i’m almost certain i did but like i said i have no memory of it, i have a couple other stories that are similar to that between cutting my foot open by kicking glass and breaking my head open on a slide but that one’s probably one of the more absurd ones
Well I’m glad you’re okay now.  One time when i was like 4 i smashed a candy dish and apparently wanted that damn candy so bad i just walked on the glass. Ended up my mother holding me down as doctors ripped big chunks of glass out of my foot. Ah memories:,) ( i didnt mean to break the candy dish )
ah damn that sucks, that’s similar to my glass kicking story cause i remember they had to stitch up my foot and i was screaming and crying the whole time
Holy! I didn’t have to get stitches, its making my feet hurt thinking about it!
yea i remember it being very painful and still a level of pain that i’d wince at now but i got a toy frog at the end so i didn’t care that much
Frogs make everything better.  My transphobic brother told me this iphone 7 identifies as an iphone 13. Kinda funny ngl
well an iphone isn’t a sentient being that has a self concept/image, so it actually isn’t able to decide what it identifies as. also comparing phone models to gender is like saying certain genders are better than one another, which doesn’t actually make sense.
I know sometimes i want to slap him
i feel you, i would be irritated asl if my brother said that but he’s also a part of LGBTQ technically speaking so he’s very non-homophobic/transphobic"	t2cnr9	NonBinary	1008	0.99	2022-02-27 01:35:12
We’re not all transmasc 🫠	"That’s it. That’s the rant. 

But, honestly, I’m getting extremely fed up with queer spaces and representation of non-binary people as AFAB people who want to be masculine. It seems that’s what everyone assumes when I tell them I’m non-binary, I basically want to be seen and treated as some flavor of “boy” which couldn’t be further from the truth! I don’t want to look like a boy— the idea gives me so much dysphoria. 

Of course, it’s not the fault of transmascs— it’s the fault of cis society for building up gender roles and expectations for an identity that is intentionally subverting that!!! Makes me want to yell!!! 

I hate feeling like I can’t belong in non-binary spaces because I don’t want top surgery or a beard or to be seen as a guy. I also hate that I don’t get to see nearly as much of transfems (whom I adore) and a wider range of non-binary masculinity and people who simply do not wish to present in either direction or don’t care how they’re received. 

But, that’s why I love this sub. I see lots of different types of enbies here and I love y’all so much."	"I'm an enby trans guy, and I've definitely noticed something too...

Representation of binary trans people is mostly about transfemmes

While with enbies it's transmascs

Binary trans guys and enby transfemmes get ignored so often, and it's awful
Yeh, amab enby here.

Hard to explain that I am not a gay fem-boy not that I am afab..so annoying
I blame the societal idea that women wanting to be men is normal and makes sense. Men being woman? Why would you want to take a lesser position? 

I am also very annoyed that nonbinary=skinnywhiteandrogeny. I get so jealous of amab nbs with glorious beards and beautiful dresses.
AMAB here and I’m hella confused with my own gender. I thought it would become clearer as I got older. I was wrong. 

A little lullaby for anyone who’s confused like me

https://youtu.be/aXAU4MmMIMo
literally this! Like I can be an afab enby without necessarily wanting to transition or look androgynous. I mean, I'm happy for the representation we get and I'm happy for any enbies who are fitting the ""ideal"" and being happy, but...

# Nonbinary people don't owe anyone androgyny.

# Nonbinary people don't owe anyone they/them pronouns.

# Nonbinary people don't have to transition.

Sure, again, everyone who does those things is valid, but after being nonbinary because we don't fit into society's expectation, society really just *created a whole new set of expectations?*Like we just want to exist, why is it so hard for society?
I feel like even “progressive” cis people think like this because they can only view non binaryness as in in of its self a “gender” rather than a generalization of a more complex and extremely varied emotion
Not to mention I’m a femme AFAB enby… like I kept my she/her pronouns I just kind of reject the concept of “woman” because I don’t feel like one. It’s really hard to explain but hopefully some folks here get it. (Also I’m old and rather than explain to people my gender identity I just kind of… do agender things mostly - imagine kind of a grunge aesthetic I gusss?)
I’m an AMAB enby. A mythical creature
Its weird because everyone automatically assumes all (binary) trans people are trans women, but all non-binary trans people are AFAB?
This is the only place I feel like my gender has been fully validated/understood/seen and where I've seen people just accept others as they are. Even when negative comments come in, they get taken down quickly.
As an AMAB enby I feel this so much. The misconception and push for androgyny or full transition can be quite annoying. Like I just want to look a little softer and maybe wear a wig, I don't have any interest in HRT nor do I think I'm a girl (for that matter I barely identify as a boy) I'm non-binary. That being said if you're looking for more trans fems I've seen them more on dedicated trans pages where they still say they're non-binary but seem to also know they don't get a lot of attention on non-binary pages.
Idk about anyone else but this issue makes me want to avoid these spaces all together. I'm often left with dysphoria triggered feeling like i don't belong.
It sucks that when telling some cis people that you’re nonbinary they automatically try to fit you into the box “boy nonbinary” or “girl nonbinary” which defeats the point entirely 😭😭
AFAB fluid enby here. While I do make efforts to look less feminine, that's more to be perceived as nonbinary, not necessarily as masculine. I avoid the term ""trans"" for the very reason you described. By definition, I *am* trans, but for the gods' sake, I'm not transmasc!
I get that 100%. I’m amab, but I don’t push any sort of fem/masc behaviors. Ideally, I try to be neutral, but not necessarily androgynous or whatever. I simply prefer to be comfortable with myself
i stopped giving a shit like a year ago i think
it sucks how people keep trying to put non-binary folks in binary boxes, even within the non-binary umbrella.
Damn I get the opposite. Everyone I know thinks non-binary people are just Women Lite™️ and I despise it so so much. 😔
I feel this so hard
Also the idea that non-binary = androgynous. Some of us are more fem presenting and some have a more masc appearance and its ridiculous to expect that all nb people fit into one stereotype of how we ""should"" look because it's someone's expectation. We're very diverse and that should be celebrated
I get you. I primarily ID as trans femme now because someone amab identifying as non-binary was just too much for people to handle, and I got sick to death of the same stupid comments. Not to mention all the 'women and non-binary' groups that are ONLY for afab people. 'Non-binary fashion' is always man-lite - shirt, suit, waistcoat, etc., etc., just cut for a different shape.

So yeah, I'm non-binary trans femme. I'm not always femme, often I'm agender, but never masc, but try explaining that for the n'th time, and it's so much easier to say trans
Amab nb/agender/bigender? (male +, expanded male? Soft masc trans lesbian?) on hrt for the last year. 40 yo husband/parent of 4. Active LDS.

I feel like a minority of a minority within a majority. Some of this, some of that, not enough of this, too much of that.

I've only just allowed myself to honestly accept and think about this part of me. I'm still figuring things out. I wish I knew more people like me, and people not quite like me. Just trying to find a place to belong and help.
Amab here and I feel this. I am transfeminine but I kinda worry that if I tell more people that I'm NB they'll think I want to be viewed more masc which is really not what I want.
I'm non binary and if you call me transmasc you offend me since I am agender. I am sick and tired of anyone who conflates presentation with gender.
Yes! Like I don’t care what you call me! I’m a person. I don’t even care if you get my name or pronouns right that much lol. Anything works, I’d rather focus on important things like solving public health and scientific crises, and learning and sharing information, not centering minor details like how my body looks in the conversation . I like looking androgynous and gender neutral language. My body is my body and it’s not perfectly androgynous so I guess I just cope.🧍I have short hair I eat healthy and I exercise- which to me is what’s important. I feel a small connection to my agab but that’s it and not the same way my peers do. 🫠 that’s it I’m pretty boring actually
I want to express as cool and comfortable in baggy tie dye...instead, I present as hot and anxious in baggy tie dye. Mostly, just appear as a cis AMAB dumpster fire, lol. I live in one of the spicier states. Also, this is the only place I have any interaction with this community or similar, so I really don't have positive or negative stories of how I am perceived. Maybe I shouldn't have shared, sorry if I distracted from the issues at hand.
As a short AMAB enby who mostly dresses like a butch woman because I did that for decades when I was closeted and it still feels right and any ""fem"" stuff feels like my male femboy side of my gender.... ugh.
Honestly it's *really* hard for me to accept the label of non binary for myself cause I don't use any pronouns besides she/her. Like I don't *feel* binary femme, like gnc trans woman I guess works but that also doesn't feel right. Like I'm woman but not. I'm a she/they transfemme minus the they.......like it's so difficult lol
So many people assume that I’m trans masc right off the bat whenever I say I’m non-binary so I’ve literally had to introduce myself in a manner which Is basically “my name is dusk, I use xey/xem pronouns and I will not hold back on punches if you call me anything that isn’t neutral” I obviously enjoy being called more feminine things with actual friends but so many people assume that I like being called a strong boy or a cute femboy or other such things just because being an afab enby is just so much more acceptable in this society
I'm afab, but my iteration of enby is 3rd gender, something not represented by the binary concept at all.  I also feel people just don't want to even try to understand. It's made me feel like an alien masquerading as a human my whole life, and that hasn't changed much since being out. We need recognition for ALL categories of human gender! I'm not a ""tomboy,"" dangit!
It's always like that: afab are expected to be transmasc and amab are expected to be transfem. The problem is that ""if you like to present masculine/feminine why do you say you're enby?"" 
Cis people usually can't understand ""non binarism"" and they think that it's mostly about looks, so if you don't look androgynous, or the opposite gender from your agab, then what's the problem with staying cis? You look the same, you look just like a ""normal boy/girl""
Transfemme enby, I do exist. /s

I agree. I recently read *Sissy* by Jacob Tobia (a non-binary, feminine presenting person) and they correctly pointed out that many people still operate in the gender-binary. So even if they want to be inclusive of other gender-identities, they often fall back on the binary. Trans people who often transition from one binary to another are given more attention since closely adheres to the binary we are used to. Its okay to want to be different, as long as you fit in. But people who aren't already involved in the gender conversation don't really understand the Non-Binary or Gender-Non-Conforming identity. Its not what they are used to.
As someone who’s amab and non-binary, my ultimate goal is to go on HRT and get as curvy as I can 😅
I'm an AFAB enby who previously was FTM, and I can  vouch that this is true. I was on the other side of the fence, and now I'm here.
I get the same remarks from people that I got when I was FTM. People don't know the difference.

The internet's perseption of non-binary people is basically just a short, skinny anime boy with a choppy haircut. Which is also the same perception they have about the ftm community.

If you're over 5'7 and you have long hair, people will literally roll their fucking eyes at you.

""When are you going to get top surgery? Have you started T yet? Why are you wearing a dress?""
I'M NOT TRANSMASC.
For me (afab), the only gender that’s less correct than “woman” is “man”. Non-binary is not some third gender, where you must transition toward “the middle” - it’s a constellation of options that rejects the binary to begin with. 💕
You're right. I hope your wishes come true. I am an enby who was afab and likes to be androgynous. Because of being misgendered as a girl for most of my life I struggle to accept any femininity I may poses. If I have to get misgendered as either a guy or a girl, I'd rather be misgendered as a guy, because it makes me feel like I look androgynous like I want. I don't want to look like a guy, I want to look androgynous, but being misgendered as a guy feels like making it even and landing on androgynous for some reason. Idk that was confusing. But there definitely needs to be more representation and acceptance of amab and transfem enbies.
I struggle so much with this too. I love being fem but the masc part of me is also quite strong. When i feel depressed or bad mentally… I lean to looking more masc passing. When I am in my element moisturized empowered fearless fairy witch I am more fem passing. 
For me the fem part always feels more like ”me” but the masc part is also a part of me, hence non binary. But sometimes I just feel like I am not non binary enough because I enjoy feeling femenine etc.
I so agree with you.
God yeah. Feeling like a “fake enby” because I wear dresses and still like girly things and occasionally using she/her is not fun.
It's just a further perpetuation of the ""tomboy"" acceptance rather than actual understanding of nonbinary people.
I HAVE BEEN JOURNALLING ABT THIS ALL WEEK DUDE THANK U.
I’ve actually never noticed this, and even myself being a transmasc enby, that upsets me. Like I wanna pass more masculinely because that’s how I feel, not because that’s how people are assuming enbies are supposed to be, ya know? Wishing you all the support and hood vibes for being your true self
i get what you’re saying but i would include that wanting top surgery but not wanting to be seen as anything boy adjacent and not wanting t as a non-binary person is really isolating. Anyone who acknowledges that ppl like me exist think its the flower and daisy path of being nonbinary and completely dismisses our struggles. Ppl assume i actually get gendered as nonbinary which is ABSURD. Not to mention there are systemic barriers to getting top surgery when you aren’t trans masc.
Yeah I've just noticed in general, on the broader trans subs of reddit there isn't much non-binary rep. Sometimes I've felt that I'm not ""trans enough"" because while I'm non-binary, I'm comfortable presenting feminine and I feel like being ""trans"" is often defined by a person's alignment with ""the opposite sex"". 

Solidarity, fren.
I hope this gives you some euphoria. They are Nonbianary and very Feminine all the time but none the less i have never seen them as anything but Nonbianary

there’s this really weird sentiment that trans people must be transitioning to “the opposite” and there’s very little space for gender-fuckery. Like I’ve heard so many people who were afab say they started medical transition (testosterone) so they could be more feminine. It also erases transneutral people when we make the new binary of transmasc and transfem. It seems like most people are incapable of expanding their view on gender beyond a binary and it’s… really frustrating. It’s called “NONbinary” for a reason. Like I don’t ID as transmasc despite being a genderqueer trans man because I’m not transitioning with the goal of being more masculine. Sure to the public eye that’s what’s happening. But I needed T for medical reasons and was forced to roll with the changes. I’m not masculine or butch or any of that. I am the fruitiest gay and femininity is really important to my sense of self. Calling me “transmasc” erases any of my complex relationship to femininity. There’s more to life and gender than masc vs fem on an exclusive binary. And what about those who are multigender? …sorry this is a bit of a ramble

edit to add: it’s so weird because on the flip side when I go on dating apps and put my gender as “nonbinary man” everyone jumps to the conclusion that I am a femboy who was amab. As if being feminine is the only way masculine-born people can be nonbinary. It’s weird as fuck. Like T has turned me into a hairy goblin. But anyone who sees nonbinary, whether they assume I was afab or amab, automatically decides I am a twink. please make it stop.
AFAB here and this pisses me off too. I believe the “androgyny” desire is based on the idea that the “male” body is seen as the NEUTRAL body. This has precedent in medical textbooks since their conception. 
Which pisses me off because why do my tits have to be sexualized to the point that even having them constitutes being more “womanly”?
I have what cis people consider to be a very feminine physicality and it’s taken me a long time to come around to loving my body as it is and now that I do I don’t want to change a thing about it (no shade to those who do) I’m just saying that, as someone who doesn’t believe in gender, why should my body have to be gendered in the first place? To me, it doesn’t take away from the fact that I feel genderless most of the time. 
It’s only other people’s perception of me that ticks me off.
I’m sure I’m not making any sense because I’m hella sleep deprived but I hope some people out there feel me.
In general, I feel like we get lumped in with trans people a lot—which isn't inaccurate for some folks, but it's not every person who identifies as NB is a future/current trans person. I've been trying to find a local support group forever and haven't found one yet that doesn't just lump NB under the trans label. When I've tried some that involves everyone together, it feels like I'm intruding—even though half the group is NB.
I'm afab non-binary, and I feel this so much. My presentation fluctuates. Some days I can't stand the idea of wearing something feminine. Most days I present femme bc I grew my hair out and wear makeup. The way I dress is often not feminine per se, but my body (wide hips, and tits) makeup and hair have me continually pegged only as femme. Makeup is art to me, and I got bored of my short hair with a fade after years of having the cut. I am far more ""masculine"" in both personality and skill set. (which I prefer to call my butch traits lol)

I don't like calling myself femme or masc necessarily but I don't want to present purely androgynous or get surgeries, or start T. So it always has me feeling unrepresented, and out of place in the community. 🫠
i’m literally the most feminine AFAB ever but like i’m not a woman, i’m enby
Some people really can't understand that transneutral, transandrogynous, and other options exist. I'm on T, but I'm still not transmasc
Thank you for bringing this discourse.
As an AMAB enby I fully agree too !
Transfem DID system here
31 transfems,
2 transmascs
1 androgynous
The 2 current fronters are Demi girl
But we many different flavors of transfem in our system
Also, yes we're intersex.
I agree with you! Afab here but i want really to get top surgery, maybe grow a moustache
Getting called a boy is a win for me!
Im afab nb, ive recently started referring to myself as transmasc. However i dont want full top surgery or a beard. I want a small chest, no facial hair and long head hair. Ill continue wearing clothes all over the decades and spectrum and keep my unshaved armpits/legs and scruffy brows. 

I consider myself transmasc because i want to look like a bishonen male. Think a long haired pretty boy. I also want to be buff as shit. But im still gonna be wearing my more femme stuff. I have no desire to look traditionally androgynous. I wanna be uncategorized in that regard. I will probably still get clocked as a woman even after I'm done with my hair growth and weight loss/exercise journey and thats ok. To myself im transmasc nb even if it looks abnormal to that description on the outside
Yes
I’m sick of telling people with NB it’s not one size fits all, not everyone who is NB uses they/them, not everyone is androgynous. I could never be androgynous with my body type anyway, but I’ve never dressed feminine in my life anyway.
My experience with nonbinary people IRL is that the NB stereotype of ""AFAB who leans towards male and gets TS and/or goes on T and uses they/them"" is actually very rare compare to how much representation that experience gets within nonbinary online spaces.
very true, us transfems enbies 4 dome reaspn don't get attention, but i want sttention cause ifk but GIMME ATTEMTION
Literally this was so hard for me as someone afab because I like wearing dresses? I like feeling pretty? But they/them feels best for me and I don’t think I am a woman.
I’ve had this feeling pop up a lot more recently bc I DO want top surgery and maybe a bit of testosterone (I’m intersex and was put on estrogen for 10+ years as a child and young adult bc my body wasn’t doing “normal girl things” and I kinda wanna balance that back out to what it would have been without) but I’m still not a dude. My top dysphoria mostly stems from severe sensory issues and that it is the thing people perceive first about me and automatically assume I’m a girl, even coworkers I constantly have to correct.. I’ve said many times I would be ok with any pronouns if I knew that it wouldn’t always only be she/her but considering all I get is she/her now when my pronouns are explicitly they/them in public.. yeah no. 
Trying to explain to people how I want to present is so hard bc I don’t relate a lot of my presentation to gender and I just want to have a flat chest so I can feel comfortable wearing pretty dresses.. if I ever told that to a therapist they would never give me my top surgery permission slip lmfao
This is also a huge source of dysphoria for me as an amab enby, cuz all I see in media is afab nonbinary representation and this makes me want to be afab so bad cuz I get the feeling I'm not being properly non binary and that I'm not in the right body
It's the opposite in any other general trans sub
I typically get ready as a trans girl, regardless of if people think I pass or not.  Kinda off topic, but in Texas it's probably also why I get ""sirred"" so much
I'm a AFAB,very femm and nb.  I hate the feeling of people not seeing me as nb but just as a girl with they/them pronouns:(
I'm a fem/Andros enby! We exist!!
I grew up witnessing such extreme toxic masculinity and femininity that I genuinly want nothing to do with either of them. When I see posts on this sub I see such a glorious range of gender expression and performance that it reminds me that the flaw isn't with the concept of gender, but with the toxic assholes I lived with. I love this sub for cleansing me of the bad energy I lived with for so long and reminding me that I love people!
i mean, it’s kind of invalidating to say “people who are afab but want to be masculine,” too. for many of us we are forced to present more masc than we like, to be taken seriously and gendered (occasionally) correctly. are you seriously excluded from non-binary spaces by afabs ? because i see a pretty even mix in this sub.
Enby transfemme here and thank for the representation 💖💖💖
There's nothing quite like cis people who tell queer folks ""you're not being queer right.""
I’m a transmasc enby who occasionally wears skirts and makeup. But I hate that ppl assume I’m fem presenting, because I don’t see it that way. I’m just wearing clothes and face paint, I’m not trying to be “fem”
 yeah, I’m genderfluid and I identify as genderless the majority of the time. I’m not transfem or transmasc.. I’m just genderless. I still experience dysphoria, I’m still non-binary, just not in the same way.
But like that sucks, really. Honestly I’m AFAB but like I don’t want to be assigned to a specific gender expression. I’m just me. And clothes are clothes. Shoes are just shoes. I wear what I feel comfortable in.
they’re trying to put us into a binary…
Agree, non-binary trans masc person.  
The world is shallow af and can't comprehend things non-binary.
Less online but irl I’ve noticed a lot of transmasc friends get misgendered they/them, were I’ve had people openly argue with me that I should be useing she/her rather than they/them

I really just don’t get it but it’s such a thing
Yeah I've noticed that too

I wonder why it happens?
We've seen that point discussed a lot and it seems that, actually, transmasc and transfem are equally represented (being binary or enby) but that most of us does not feel that way because of personal bias. For instance, as a transfem enby, I'm afraid that we take too much space and that fear makes me feel like there is not much transmac enby rep, which is quite the opposite of what you and OP describe.

Our community is not monolithic at all, and the way we see it hugely depends on where we live, our age, our personal story etc. and obviously our gender or lack of thereof. General statements about who is represented or not may give the false impression that our community is monolithic and that our experiences are the same.

Also, I'm afraid this false impression gives (wrong) arguments to enbyphobia: if we cannot overcome binarity within our very own community, enbyphobes will state this is because we cannot overcome binarity on a personal level. Both of these statements are false: transfem and transmasc are equally represented (even if personal bias makes it hard to witness) and binarity is a social construct that we've successfully left behind.
Sadly, so true.

All stereotypes are harmful. Each person is a different universe.
I have told some of my friends several times that I am trans non-binary and my pronouns are they/them or she/her. Still, after months (basically years for some), a certain set of people keeps conveniently forgetting I've ever come out, or like, publicly announced my pronouns, and I have to re-re-remind them that I do not, in fact, go by he/him anymore. And of course, I get sick of reliving that stupid conversation for people over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. So these people see me as a gay guy, or a fem-boy, if I'm lucky. I've even been on Estrogen for 9 months on this month. One of these people is my roommate and close friend of 9 years.
I *love* that society is gender stereotyping non binaries based off the binary. The Irony of it
That's exactly where I feel I am, I don't really want to be identified as either masculine or feminine by people, although I dress more masculine because I'm poor and restyling my closet is outside of the realm of possibility and my style sense
I also really hate the non-binary = skinny, white, androgyny shit. Like if that’s you, cool! But I don’t like the rest of society assuming that’s what we HAVE to look like. I’m not skinny nor androgynous and that really takes a toll on me when all the non-binary people I see aren’t like me.
Unfortunately it’s not just an idea, there is historical precedent:

Masculine names becoming feminine: Stacey, Vivian, Dylan, Elliot, Jules

Masculine clothing becoming feminine or gender neutral: High heels, tights, berets, trousers, blue jeans

Women woking in traditional masculine jobs

There aren’t many examples the other way around, and of the ones I can think of men tend to be hostile towards woman rather than embracing/accepting the idea of the thing they’ve adopted ever being feminine: Bronies, software engineers 

Some of it is explained not by gender so much as men being allowed to participate in society and women being forbidden from doing so. Or in other words, it’s not that feminine people want masculine work, or that the work was ever innately masculine to begin with, it’s just that those are the jobs that pay well.

“Why would you want to take the lesser position?” Isn’t a *wrong* idea it’s just the wrong question. The question should be *why are these traits and roles treated as lesser positions?*

And the answers is…

*opens a gold trimmed envelope*

…the fragile and toxic masculinity of the patriarchy! 

And the runner up… The patriarchy has held power for so long that their concepts are deeply embed in social norms and people respect a floral dress less than a three piece suit without even thinking about it

And the bronze medal goes to… A small group of men in control of major media sources who wield soft power to discredit and disempower anything not only takes power away from straight cis white men but also anything that even suggests that straight cis white men are a category of human rather than its normal form

However at a certain point it becomes a chicken or the egg argument
Yeah i feel this rly hard as a nonbinary person who is medically detransitioning. I feel like these ideals made me feel I had to prove I fit in the binary by transitioning medically. (Especially as a teenager without big oicture perspective.) I don’t regret my whole medical transition, but I do regret some of the medical decisions I can’t take back. I wish medically transitioning was seen more as a personal decision instead of something people who don’t fit gender roles *should* do.
People like rules
I've noticed this too that i feel like cis allies treat nonbinary as a third gender. Assuming they/them pronouns, assuming they're aiming for androgyny, stuff like that. It's getting really frustrating.
Yeah, I dont mind being called a femboy (mostly) and I even feel like its a good description for how im feeling sometimes. But usually its on some “femboy” spectrum I feel like and I get really uncomfortable when someone views me as *only* a femboy or puts me in a box. 

And some days I just feel so uncomfortable having to live up to societal expectations and I get really sad when I think that the only way for people to view me as queer or NB is to wear nail polish (which I love) or skirts (which I also love) but I just dont feel like it sometimes. 

And so if im not doing those things im just an average skinny white boy that’s probably smart and awkward because they have glasses and ugh. Even typing that out makes me feel so frustrated.
Yay! This is me too and I have such a hard time articulating it! It was hard figuring it out for myself, let alone others. But when I came out to my partner his response was ""you just want to be seen as nim. Thats who you are. I love your brain above anything else"" He nailed it! 😭

Also grunge aesthetic is the most fun to play with imo
Same. Im AFAB and present ultra femme. I always have acrylic painted nails, tons of makeup and jewelry, and long dyed hair. I put tons of effort into looking femme because that’s what I like. Because of all this I find that never I fully blame people for always calling me she/her but at the same time I did come out *multiple* times as nonbinary (they/them). There are some who have never called me by my preferred pronouns despite correcting every time. Im so frustrated that everyone who knows me well (not random strangers because obviously they’d use she/her) put no effort into practicing. It’s disrespectful.
I'm so happy to see this comment rn! I've been struggling with my gender identity for a while (again haha) and I've been leaning into the nb direction but I'm AFAB and enjoy feminine things (I've been wearing more skirts lately, wearing makeup and jewelry) and I feel guilty about it (stupid I know). I never allowed myself to be feminine when I was a kid bc it made me uncomfortable but now that I'm at least trying to figure out my gender I feel like I want to embrace femininity in my own kind of way, but all of the AFAB enbys I see (online, don't know anyone irl) are more masc and it makes me feel like an imposter I guess...
You do belong tho. <3
Same, wonder if it’s a regional thing
i feel this on a spiritual level
""my gender is like something you'd get at costco. Like it's clearly 'girl', but there's definitely something off about it.""

-- Some comedian I can't remember

But more sincerely: pronouns complement your gender, they don't define it! Once again for the people in the back: 

PRONOUNS COMPLEMENT YOUR GENDER, THEY DON'T DEFINE IT!
>like it's so difficult lol

I totally get it. Most of the time I don't feel ""female,"" but I'm not a man. I don't feel like I'm a ""tom boy"" or ""butch"" either. I actually would be happy as a clam to embrace androgyny most of the time...aside from the 1-3 times a year I feel female.
Very much same to all this!
I need to read this book!
I feel seen
This is what I’m talking about. The assumptions drive me crazy
You are non-binary enough 💙
Thanks for this! What a great performance!
That’s really gross how people treat you on dating apps. I’ve seen people say they want to become more physically masculine so they can wear feminine clothes and I thought I understood the sentiment, but now I’m not sure. 

If I’m feeling feminine, I wear feminine things and yeah, people will gender me was a girl, but that’s not my fault. I can understand wanting that “boy in a dress” look, even though it’s not for me, but I don’t like how it implies that femininity can’t be non-binary if it’s on AFAB people who don’t transition medically.
I feel this SO HARD. I’m currently in the medical field and so many things that apply to male and female bodies. We are more alike than we are different!!! People are always talking about men’s tits! Women with strong arms!!! Men with full lips and long hair!!! Hello????

I stan your sleep deprived ramblings.
That’s exactly how I think of it. My butch traits. I’m a lesbian, so my relationship to “womanhood” has always been complicated because femininity and womanhood is so tangled up in hetero patriarchy. 

I have a desire to be taken cared of like anyone else, but I feel so strongly attached to the role of the typical “man”. That doesn’t mean I want to look like a man OR a woman. And I think it’s also harming cis people who don’t feel connected to their gender roles but aren’t trans. 

I could go on, but I really appreciate this
I appreciate this. AFAB + Fem does not equal girl.
I said at the bottom of this post that this sub is the exception
People are weird fr. I'm not transmasc but I use he/they pronouns, mostly he, and something similar happened to me. Not irl but buying something on ig where I have my face in my pfp. I clearly talked about myself in masculine to kinda state my pronouns and the girl went all the time with girly girl woman but then another time when I talked in gender neutral pronouns she respected it. It's like they will respect they/them pronouns but not others?
ah yes, your close friend of 9 YEARS ""conveniently"" forgot you don't use he/him.
People often think men is the default and woman sexy extra. It is a sexist stereotype from a vis het dominated society.

The gay part is especially annoying, Since I am ""no-men"" too. (Emby preferable). Why must everything about men?  🙄
Oh wow that sucks but I feel you. Sometimes because I look “normal” I feel like people just slip back into what they are comfortable with. Luckily I have had some good friends and I’m not shy about reminding people, but it still hurts ya know?
Those friends are bad friends. It's about effort and intention, and they're either intentionally forgetting or putting in zero effort to even try. You deserve people in your life who respect you.
I’m not white or afab and a bit to muscular for the skinny category
This is my biggest issue with binders. Please don't show me an ad for a skinny white person in a binder and tell me that it works. Yes, ofc it does...there's barely anything there to begin with! Sorry, this is off-topic haha, just a little rant.
So, basically i'm an amab transfem that got followed around, called at, stared at and such.

And this is because people can't accept a men becoming more feminine. 

But i assure you, women do this too. It could be called patriarchy, but it's not fed by men only. It's fed by some women too.

I literally saw some women telling amab nb or transfem that they are ridiculous and that they should be strong and such. I agree with you, but only if we bring some women in the equation too.
My favorite example of a job going the other way around, from traditionally feminine to traditionally masculine is programming. The history of programming comes from mathematics, and mathematics had been using women to do the tedious calculations for years and years and years. So when early programmers needed someone to do the tedious work of producing assembly or even pure bit code, they used the same community of women.

Eventually it became obvious that the grunt work was actually extremely valuable work. Businesses started to hinge on the quality of the actual code, not the idea behind the code. Each major computing region had different responses to this sudden realization. The UK straight up fired all the women and had men try and pick up the work from scratch. The US had women teach their work to the men who would replace them. Both methods set the progress of computing back, but the UK method set them back so far that they utterly destroyed the lead they got from the WW2 code breaking research. This allowed the US Silicon Valley to take the lead in innovation.

The nitty gritty details are absolutely fascinating.
Yeah, societal pressure has really hurt the non-binary community. I’m sorry that you were pressured into a full medical transition when it wasn’t right for you, I hope you’re doing better now.
I feel like an imposter sometimes too. It’s why I kept she/her (it doesn’t bother me anyway and it’s less explaining to do to people who don’t need to know). All I know is I’m annoyed at being seen as a woman but also my apparent cisness means I do live life experientially as a woman. And I’m not bothered enough about my body for surgery or anything so it’s really just an internal acceptance that I’m agender. It’s frustrating and always has been because people treat me like “a girl” and I don’t like anything that comes with that aspect.
Hell yeah! We’re making a club now
Hugs 💜
🥰 Nonbianary people are valid in ANY way you want to be
yeah exactly!!! medical transition isn’t for everyone. Wearing girl clothes when you’re masculine and boy clothes when you’re feminine should not be the only way to be nonbinary. But it’s not “valid” unless you’re aiming for androgyny which is incredibly weird and leans into the whole “nonbinary is simply woman-lite” sentiment that so many hold.
 Because they’ve realized they already use they/them for binary and cis people so it isn’t as much of a ‘challenge’
Hah, yeah... Tbh I've been a little worried about where his heart lies politically lately. He spends most of his time with his Fox News-watching dad and playing online games with his two Republican friends from highschool, one of whom rehashes the same stupid racist/sexist/homophobic jokes he was making 10 years ago. Furthermore, despite many in-depth conversations I've had with him over the years, my roommate seems to be regurgitating a lot of red-scare style ""jokes"" about how capitalism is the only thing that works. The other night he was saying how episode 3 of The Last Of Us is probably his favorite onscreen representation of a gay couple, because ""they don't wave it in your face"" and it's ""just a normal couple."" Which like, don't get me wrong, I largely agree in some ways, and I fuckin cried for the last third of that episode it was so beautiful. But in tandem with the other red flags, it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth to hear this particular friend say that. He also said how ""even my dad loves it, which is saying something."" Like okay, so when the gays and the femmes aren't around, your dad is a homophobe? Wow, I'm really won over.

He also has become a very heavy drinker in the last couple years, and I've noticed it's started impacting his memory. Sometimes he repeats things he's already told me in the same day, and I guess in a weird defense of him ""forgetting"" my pronouns or that I had multiple conversations with him explaining my pronouns for him, he doesn't really seem very mentally present these days. But that just makes me worry more, for both his health and his ability intelligently engage with sociopolitical rhetoric.
Half indigenous, skinny (not because it's healthy, but because of our DID + ADHD we tend to forget to eat) we're too skinny to fit the mold. and our androgyny mostly comes from our voice. SO ppl assumes that we're a girl.
My issue is I’m like 6ft athletic fit broad shouldered but small waisted and I have a deceiving chest. It looks smaller because my shoulders. Binders aren’t made for my ratios so either they’re tight in the shoulders to flatten my chest and meet my torso or they fit my shoulders and loose on chest and torso. Tank ones never have the right length either. And I can’t tape because I’m allergic to adhesive. 🤦
Oh 100% yes the Partiarchy is also enforced and kept up by many, many women.   
Patriarchy =/= Actions of only the male parts of Society. That is not the definition of Partiarchy at all :)
Thank you! I have been off hormones for over a year now and I’m feeling much more at peace with myself.
I've always been a girl in society's eyes so I'm used to being treated as such and I definitely prefer that over being seen as a man. That's why I go by she/they (we don't have a widely recognized gender neutral pronoun in German so that's why it's still just technically she/her). I do sadly sometimes struggle with my body but it's luckily not constant and I can mostly ignore my anger towards it when it happens. I just wish I didn't feel like I have to proof my non-cis-ness to claim the nb label
I believe in you 💙
In my case is different since I speak Spanish but if I interpreted correctly what you meant it feels like the reason why she respected my pronouns when I used they but not he would be the same reason applied for english they/them.  

Like if using gender neutral pronouns is not as big of a challenge as using the complete opposite pronouns right?  As if they don't see they/them as ""that trans"" on their eyes so they don't mind they/them but won't use what they see as the complete opposite of the agab's person, that makes it too real and seems to make it more difficult for them.
Im sorry :( I know the feeling of trying to explain something so important to you, but the other person just doesn't listen/understand so it's like talking to a brick wall. It also sucks seeing someone you care about struggling/not listening to anything you say. No one deserves to be misgendered, and it hurts even more when it's by someone you care about.
Oh boy sounds real fun
This. The Patriarchy empowers men but that doesn’t mean men are the only ones who perpetuate its values
True, but i pointed out that's not the ""fragile and toxic masculinity"" or a ""small group of men in control"" only. It's also how some women conceptualize femininity and how the act toward trans women.

I like to point this out because i don't like to see a complex discourse reduced to toxic masculinity, when there is much more involved 😁
Glad to hear that :).
Yes exactly

In fact, some of the loudest voices against women's suffrage in the US were women.
Yes, TERFs can go fuck themselves
It was sarcastic.
Sadly it's not only terfs 🥲

I saw cis women enforce this society. The mother of a friend of mine to begin with, but some sh*t i read written by women also.

I think I might be trans non binary but my girlfriend is a radfem: an update!	"Hey! I'm the same person who wrote about questioning their gender and thinking about continue transition while having an openly radfem girlfriend. I have some news that I wanted to share with yall!

First, this week I went to a transgender clinic with a non binary friend. I felt really comfortable, my friend was even surprised! They said I looked so happy while talking about transitioning and that I'm definitely not cis. I agree, while talking about how I feel and my desires I realized I certainly have a more similar experience of what being trans is rather than being cis. However, I still don't feel worthy of calling myself trans or non binary. 

I also talked to my mom about my dysphoria, and gave some ""discreet hints"" about not being cis and she was very okay about it! She was only confused why my dysphoria is back, but I'm feeling the same lol, so no worries. But I'm don't feel safe yet to talk about medical transition, I'll wait until I'm more comfortable and sure about my identity.

Second: yes, I broke up with my (now ex) girlfriend. It was a respectful conversation, where both sides were heard. My questioning wasn't the only thing that made me want to break up, she did some little things that made me upset during our relationship that didn't get better. She also have some personal issues she's working through that were also impacting our relationship. 

During the conversation, I said she didn't treat trans people with decency and that she, from my perception, have a very simplistic idea of what being trans and dysphoric is, and due to that I was afraid of talking about my situation with her. She said that it wouldn't matter if I identify as any label of trans, that ""she even has a non binary friend"", she would still love me and treat me with respect, but she would still see me as a woman. She also said that the not so good thing she calls trans people are only ""jokes"" but she wouldn't misgender them or anything (even tho she still does that). After breaking up, I felt relieved! I'm exited to discover myself again and meet new people!"	"Congrats 🎉 amazing update it sounds like things are going well and you’re in a good position to grow, explore, and take care of yourself as a unique and special person. I’m so happy for you💜🌈
Congratulations and good luck moving forward
No radfems. Only rad femmes
Oh thank god I’m soo glad you broke it off.
Aww I remember that post. What a fucking victory. Love to see it 🥲
your ex was a little dick. i hope the rest of your journey is much better! my one piece of advice is to take shit from no one
Thank GOD for this update! My friend, I was genuinely worried about you, and now I’m seeing this?! You got yourself to a point where you went to talk about this openly, and felt okay with that. That’s a huge step. I know after my first appointment with a gender specialist i felt a lot more at ease. More accepting of myself and what I may want in the future. 

Medically transitioning isn’t necessary but for a lot of us it’s the only option to get piece of mind in our bodies. I’m currently weighing up the pros and cons of top surgery, it’s a big thing for me, and it’s okay to take the time to consider all the options you have, or don’t have. 

I’m really happy you got out of that relationship, because telling a person “I’ll support you but I won’t ever believe you or accept you as yourself” is NOT supportive or kind or okay. That’s the opposite of support. If it were true, they wouldn’t have  said “but I’ll see you as a woman”. I’m sorry that they couldn’t even for a second out aside their own bullshit for you. Because you sound really cool and super nice, it’s their loss completely. 

So go and thrive, it’s the best way to live your life. We don’t get given a whole lot of time, never waste a minute on doubting yourself or who you are.
Go fucking get it, you absolute monarch 🏳️‍⚧️❤️💜
Can we normalize not affirming TERFs as feminists? They are not feminists. They are transphobes who weaponize feminist ideas to focus their hate.
💖💖💖
Congratulations 🥳 Hope your self-love journey w/your new identity goes well! 

Came out as Nonbinary back in May 2021. 💖
She wouldn't do anything disrespectful yet would still see you as a woman.. lmao good thing that's over
Wooooo boy! I can't tell you how excited I am reading this. I didn't even read the other original post you made, and I don't know you at all, but I'm proud of you! These are huge moves towards self actualization, way to go.
Good job!  I'm proud of you!

(Although, I do wish people wouldn't use radfem a short hand for terf - it's a specific branch of feminism that can also be trans-inclusive. And most terfs aren't even real feminists, let alone radical ones).
So glad for you! And so good you broke up with someone like that: if she doesn’t see you as who you are, that’s not respect. There are plenty of other ppl who will actually respect you.
😄🎉
wow your ex is just yikes
>she would still love me and treat me with respect, but she would still see me as a woman.

tf? This is absolutely NOT treating a non-binary/trans person with respect. 🤬

If you are enby/trans, you are not your AGAB and don't want to be treated like it 😠
❤️❤️❤️
I’ve been waiting for this update! Live your best life and know that you’re valuable and wonderful.
Congratulations!!! We’re proud of you ♥️ keep going! You got this
So so happy for you
💜💜💜
Im so happy for you. I hope the rest of your journey goes well.
i don't think i saw your first post so i'm not familiar with your story but i'm so glad to hear you're feeling better and making awesome progress on your gender journey! happy for you 🥰
Waah, I'm happy for you! <3 I feel like you know this, even if your ex gf and society tried to surpess it; you are totally worthy of calling yourself nb and trans, say it with me ""I'm worthy and valid"".
Amazing update!! Congratulations and I'm wishing you the best of luck and all the happiness with everything in your future😊
Youre doing amazing! Im proud of you! 

And dont worry about calling yourself non binary.
If it feels comfortable for decribing yourself go for it!
Both terms are umbrella terms that cover a great deal of different experiences! Non binary is simply not always fully feeling like your agab. Whether that is genderfluid, demi, a-gender etc.
Congrats! Sounds like you have already made huge steps in your journey! Never forget you have a whole community here to support you! 🏳️‍⚧️💕
Happy to hear you are doing better and have people who support you.

I am kinda questioning if I trans too but have not yet gone to talk to a mental health professional about this because I have not found a person who is openly LGBTQ supportive. Like gender dysphoria is still labeled as *mental illness* in my country.
Thank your for the update! I’m so happy to hear that things are looking up for you. I’m very happy that you’re able to stretch your wings and grow into yourself.
Keep being an amazing human being!
Radical Feminism isn't inherently transphobic, it is merely the belief that social restructuring as well as political laws are necessary to achieve feminism.
Quotas, the debate on the male gaze, the fight against gender norms and roles are all parts of radical feminism.
TERFs misinterpret radical feminism to their liking despite many radical feminist authors being trans-inclusive, please don't let them take away this tradition from actual real feminists.
And I'm glad you got red of her, she seems toxic asf.
YAY! So glad to hear you're doing better :)
I am very proud of you! It can be incredibly hard to leave the ones we love in order to move forward comfortably in our lives. I wish you happiness :)
Congratulations 🎉 and proud to read the edit 😊
I'm glad for you, cousin. I wish peace and happiness for you. That took courage and strength to get through. Be proud.
Hi, I commented on that post! So glad to hear you're in a better place now. I wish you the best on your gender journey ❤️
I didn’t see the original post but good on you for being able to break things off! Here’s to hoping your journey is a great one! 👍
 good thing u broke up with her
Good job taking this step for yourself. Proud of you.
You have earned this massive W. I admire your agency and taking control of your life. I wish nothing but blessings for you from here on out💖

Remember to love yourself, monarch🌺
🙌🏻
I love the double meaning here. Not only is monarch a nonbinary term for royalty but also a type of butterfly which is appropriate as well.

Idk why I'm tickled so much by this, but I am.

ninja edit: also, sorry if I'm being lame for literally explaining the joke, but it is too good for people to just scroll past.
I apologize for that. I thought radfem and terf were synonyms. But yes, my ex is trans exclusionary. I didn't want to date someone who say really bad things about people like me and make me feel unsafe to talk about my situation.
Agreed about radfem vs TERF. There *are* radical feminists who are trans-inclusive, and I worry that we run the risk of alienating them if we say radfem when referring to the TERFy ones.
unrelated but i love that DF avatar
You're right and you should say it. Radical feminism is a very cool thing that was co-opted by very hateful people
Not sure why you are getting downvotes for effectively saying the same thing I got upvoted for. Trans-inclusive radical feminists do exist, and not just in a soggy toast “well, I’m inclusive by not being exclusive” way. Many radical feminist ideas have contributed to our society(ies) becoming more accepting of gender binary non-conformity in the past several decades. Let’s not throw out the allies with the shitwater!
Oh it was GREAT for you to explain it, because I didn’t even know what I did there
I bet they've never read any actual radfem theory either, most theorists were hella pro trans.

And if they've read any, it's probably the idiots that wrote transsexual empire and the other idiots that started political lesbianism.

Fighting dysphoria, but still feeling good. What would be a good name for me?		"How about Cameron?
regardless of name, WHAT A STUNNING PERSON YOU ARE!!!
You look like a Bailey! :)
How about ""Kay"", which if you are generfluid or need to pass for a different gender for safety reasons could stand for Kayla or Karl? Btw your hair is so pretty! It suits you thude, don't let dysphoria tell you otherwise.
What ever name makes you feel like fabulous you!
Andromeda or Aurelia 🖤🖤🖤
April!!!
You look like a Meadow or an Amber to me :)

You make me think of Katie or Kate!
Cindy
Honey
April
Jody
I'm not sure why, but the name Aya immediately came to mind.
Jasmine?
Asher and Lauren were the first names I thought of! If you want something a little more masc, Laurence could work.
Hmm obviously the Decision is up to you ultimatelly but how about Dominique? It is in my opinion a very neutral name and has multile ways of how it could be written and thereby slightly differently pronounced?
Julaine
AH you're eyebrows, I'm in LOVE 😭 

Idk how nuetral you're looking for but I vibe with Aveline maybe? Avé may be a cool one too!
Femme leaning: Kat or Casey

More neutral: Ren/wren

Masc leaning: Flynn
Lynwood was my first thought.
ooooo but you look like a Stella, Francisca, or Vanessa!
I think June or Clairo could suit you
Anna or alice
Olivia, Amber
Sophie
Alex
Amber is the first name that came to mind!
First that popped in my head was Catherine or Catie/Katie. Could even go for a camryn.

Daisy!
Honestly, its giving Trixie for me or Trix
Isabella💕
I get Cynthia vibes, somehow
A bit late but as soon as I saw you I thought Angela, beautiful name for a beautiful person :)
I think Rosemary or Rose would suit you well. This may be presumptuous, but your picture gives me the same vibes as a flowery field on a summer day, and I get the same feelings from those names
Alexa
I'm getting Cara or Tara vibes.
Or Tarryn.
You seem like a Reagan lol
Izzy, or something else with a Z in it! :3

Your hair looks so good!
You look like a Layla to me (:
 Frfr you look like a Francesca!!🤎🔥
Heather!
What about Ashley or Robin? Please take this as a compliment,  you remind me of Jennifer Anniston,  so I was thinking Jen.  😀
At first glance, you seem like an Ashley (the good kind lol).

Now if you'll excuse me, I have Escape the Fate stuck in my head.
Ollie!
Jonez
Jan
Angela 💛💛
Idk why but like Sam or Samantha just seems right
Freaking amazing curls!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sapphire!
Lea
How about Evelyn? Also your hair is amazing my friend!
I get Amber vibes personally!
Malia <3
Fem- Kaylie
Masc- caleb
I love the name shay I feel that's a happy one!!!
Dear god you look amazing
you look a bit like my cousin, Leanne, who I really looked up to as a kid. You could probably also write that a bit differently (drop the e maybe?) and pronounce it lee-in if you want something more gender neutral.
Lazuli uwu
what do you think of something like sage/fern? might be too overly naturey but i think both are very pretty names. dysphoria is a bitch but just so you know, you're gorgeous!! all the best gender envy /pos 🥰💕
I’m feeling a name with an E… Ella, Stella, Elle, Eva, I could keep going lol
Angelica!
Blair (Scottish) means ""dweller on the path"" its a gender-neutral name but could be taken either way depending on the person using it, i personally think its a cute name that has some majesty to it
Geneviève (the French pronunciation), Callie, Protea, Daphne (or Chloé 😅)
clara
amber, carrie, autumn maybe
How about Carla.
Ouuu I got immediate Isabelle vibes. :)
Stacey
Jessie or Liz
Sindy
for some reason Ted or Charlie come to mind
Greg
Chad
I never thought of that. 🥰
Carmen sounds better
OMG I love that!
I was going to say Lily/Lee but I love Bailey!!
I second that
That’s my chosen name; I always look at it as a nickname of my birth name, but I realized it could be fluid too once I read a Arthurian book with a knight named Sir Kay lol ☺️
Love, love, love!!!
🤔 Interesting. I like that name.
Is that a name or you just calling me honey? Lol jk
I love that!
I love that name suggestion! Thank you!
That’s is such an interesting name! 😃
Oooh Stella!!!! I like that!
I was going to suggest the same two names!!! OP, it's a sign.
Interesting, I once thought maybe Xander but my siblings name is Alex and that’s too close for comfort I think
Beautiful!
Lulu is very fun. That’s the kind of name you gotta live up to. Thank you!
Thank you!!!!!
Thank you! This was taken after a whole day out and about in humid South Florida so I was feeling good that it didn’t get too frizzy. I used Color Wow Anti-Frizz Dreamcoat
Ooh like Shay Mitchell 😍😍😍
Thank you! That’s so sweet 🥰🥰🥰
I think it fits pretty well! A cute name for a cute person!
Weird comment but you look exactly like my babysitter from years ago, whose name was Cameron lol
Lily is a pretty name its my Girlfriends name ha but its way to common .. cheers!!
Nah, I suggested Honey as your name, sorry :D
Of course! I hope you find the right fit! A cutie deserves a cute name!
Woah 🤯
Oh that’s lovely. I appreciate it.
Lol. Thanks again :)
Ok now I’m blushing 😊

"I'm kind of annoyed by the ""guess my gender"" trend"	"I understand why people want people to guess/assume what their gender would be but why are we pushing the binary through amab vs afab? Like it's kind of painful and dysphoria inducing to see so many people post an image of theirselves literally asking people to guess their genitals..

Why?"	"Yeah I never reply cause like... how on earth can you guess someone's internally felt gender identity from thier presentation? I mean it feels like being asked to do something kinda creepy and wrong (to me)

I've internalized that presentation /= gender and that bodies /= gender so like... my only answer would be 'I see your bio says x so you're x?' or 'tell me your gender and then I'll know what it is'

I guess since I have very strong social dysphoria I just... would never want anyone to try to 'clock' my assigned sex, or assume my gender identity based on what I wear? It's that kinda stuff that makes me scared to just wear what I like

I'm trying to get away from all that and the whole idea one can (or should try to) 'pass' as nonbinary makes me want to scream. The whole point was to remove the pressure to conform to any gendered roles or expectations and just do our own thing, right?

I don't want to have to fit in yet another gender box instead
strong agree. it's annoying and pushes a bad model of gender imo
Yeah like I can kinda get it in the trans sub because there are people there who are transitioning to a binary gender and they want to pass as a certain binary gender so it’s a way to get a gauge on how well they’re passing but the point of non-binary is kinda….not the binary? Like outside the binary? Like there is no binary here stop asking if you pass as male or female in a non-binary sub? 

It’s also kinda triggering for me because it brings to mind that when strangers look at me they’re probably playing that game in their heads when they see me and I don’t exactly look like the agender blob I want to look like.
I agree and I'm concerned that some people might loose sight of the fact that not everyone can or is concerned with passing.
I don't like it either. I'm not a cis person. I don't want to pretend to be a cis person.
i agree that it's not great to see this trend, but i think it plays into the very relatable (and completely understandable) desire to ""pass"" as non-binary, or perhaps more nebulously, androgynous. although presentation is only one part of identity, it's super normal and valid to feel anxiety about it or the way it's perceived. however, non-binary is an umbrella term, so it follows that there's not going to be just one ""look"". on the other hand, androgyny seems to be, in my experience, a shorthand for a constellation of a pretty narrow and normative set of non-binary gender performances, presentations, and expectations that generally center thinness, whiteness, and a vague sort of masculinity tempered by a youthful softness. so, i feel like since trying to ""look"" non-binary or ""look"" androgynous are both super reductive and also unattainable in those two ways. i think the trend would be super fun if we asked ""guess my gender"" in a very loose mood board-y kind of way maybe? that way people could be validated in their performance of a queer gender without having to rely on the gender binary or normative stereotypes of gender nonconformity. it would make a lot more sense to about gender as ""your vibe"" instead of anything else i guess.  idk if any of this made sense but it's pretty much my thoughts on the matter :)
oh yeah it heavily enforces that the gender binary is everything for gender
Agreed, for a community based on the idea of rejecting the gender binary, there seem to be a lot of posts recently by people (probably unintentionally) implying that their place in the gender binary is actually very important to them. And there’s nothing wrong with that! But would another sub maybe make more sense for that kind of inquiry? (To be PERFECTLY clear, I’m against all forms of gatekeeping, and it’s not my place to say what anyone should or shouldn’t post in any sub … it’s just something I find fairly confusing.)
i especially avoid the ones that ask ""do i look amab or afab?"" bc the comments say stuff like ""this is feminine"" or ""that is masculine"" etc as if feminine = afab and masculine = amab. i have my own issues with agab labels enough that i dont want to see them being reinforced in a nonbinary space :(
Probably to reassure themselves they are presenting as they intend. Just a poor word choice.
I 100% agree. Not sure why we, who identify as non binary, want to know what our gender binary is. It almost seems to me to take some of the seriousness out of it, like we want to be respected and taken seriously. But then don’t care to? I don’t know. I definitely agree with you though 💚
Big agree, especially as someone who’s actually intersex, but it’s also just really frustrating to see this heavily gendered cisnormative crap in a space that’s supposed to be a safe space AWAY from that shit. People wrongly gendering us based on appearance and similar things is literally one of the biggest problems our community faces, why are we encouraging that further within our own spaces?
Mod here. This post was locked because we feel it's run its course. Some points:

Going back several hundred posts there were only about a dozen posts in this vein, and not all of them even used agab terms as opposed to masc or femme terminology. Unless (lots of) people are deleting their posts, this type of post is currently a small fraction of the sub's volume.

We are not going to create a flair for this topic. It's one of several cyclical topics that will run its course in another few weeks and not be popular again for a while. 

Nonbinary is possibly the broadest identity category excepting queer. Broad categories are always going to have murky edges and contain vastly different experiences. Part of participating here is understanding that there are people here who do not share your life experiences in *any* way except that they are also nonbinary. You are going to make each other uncomfortable because what may be validating to you is going to feel invalidating to someone else, and vice versa. Part of being a community is giving each other some space to work out feelings even if someone is using language for themselves that doesn't apply to you.

There are nonbinary people whose identities contain aspects of manhood, womanhood, maleness, and femaleness. There are nonbinary people who wish to, or need to, for their authenticity, safety, or both, know which binary gender they are generally being read as. Seeking input on that question is not pushing the binary. It is acknowledging that the binary is something we have to deal with outside of this space in the wider world. People asking these questions here are asking them here in order to deal with the wider world. We are not going to send nonbinary people to a binary space to ask those questions.

A huge cause of dissension in LGBTQ communities is people in the same identity claiming exclusive definitions of terms that contradict each other. The Discussion flair is probably the least used non-restricted flair. Discussions about the connotations of agab terms, gendering people with agab terms, and other vocabulary can be discussed on their own at any time, not just when conflict prompts it. These sorts of discussions are where people can come to better understandings of each other without carrying bad feelings over from other conflicts. 

This sub is meant to be a safe space from external transphobia, but as a matter of conscience we are not going to draw bright lines around ""nonbinary"" in ways that exclude whole groups of nonbinary people whose genders interact with the binary. Nonbinary people whose genders interact with the binary and those whose genders are entirely separate are all nonbinary, and it is up to us to figure out how to be(come) a community.
Yesss gender is not presentation
It made me feel weird when i first saw it but i like that the comments are often like ‘you look elven’ or ‘you look rad’ rather than like “you look like you have x genitals”
I also hate it as someone who is always perceived as only a ""cis woman"" by people and idk when if ever I can start T. It will probably be several years, and I am already in my 30s.

I would love to be androgynous-lookikg and have folks not be able to tell my gender or guess ""wrong"" that I'm amab but that's just not in the cards for me right now. 

So those posts suck for me
I’m waffling on this one. On one hand a forum like this is probably one of the safer places to ask if you “pass” or not to help feel more confident, but on the other hand, I feel like it could serve a subconsciously negative purpose as well. Comparing “passing progress” has historically been a source of self-harm in some pockets of our community. I have my own personal hang ups because I do have desires to be perceived a certain way, but know it’s probably not possible. 

I usually don’t respond because I don’t wanna hurt someone’s feelings if I say the wrong thing. I always feel weird about trying to “clock” or read someone, even if it’s consensual.
I'm not a fan, either, and other comments have expressed the problems with it better than I could.

I assume people are hoping for the validation of responses that their AGAB is hard to guess? People should feel validated, but I think we should also consider if we're accidentally reinforcing what we're meant to be escaping.

Slightly unrelated: anyone else find the ""name me"" trend annoying, too? I can't think of a way it's immediately problematic but I am personally so bad at naming things that it seems pointless, superficial even, to come up with something as personal as a name from just a stranger's appearance. I wonder whether we should have some kind of pinned post (is that a thing?) with advice on how to pick a name.

Edit to be clear: I'm probably tired and grumpy so this hasn't come out too kindly. People are obviously allowed to like/do different things to me, but I'd rather not see those posts - another one for a filterable flair!
I agree. I will preface this with I am a newly hatched tadpole. I feel like it puts this expectation on Non-binary people to have a certain look, or always be ambiguously cis, and it's really damaging to those still grappling with the way they present VS society gender role expectations, like me.


They make me uncomfortable.


I don't care what you present as, or what your genitals look like. I don't appreciate the reinforcement of the socially-approved ""Non Binary"" look as the 'peak' version of being enby.


Just be who you are, it's already magnificent.
Agreed,
I agree. I have had people message me online asking me if I am male, or female, or asking what genitals I have.  I feel that it is nobody's business. It is bad enough dealing with that. I do not want to see the guess my gender posts. It just reminds me of the trauma.
Oh my Dog, yessssssssssssss! Thank you! This comment is everything right now.

No offence to people who need that validation but yep, it becomes invalidating for *me*…
I mean, if they're *asking* and not doing it to people who don't ask, I think it's fine.

People want to know how well they pass, and that's less dysphoria for them. Doesn't necessarily mean they're pushing a binary.

If anything, there should be a flair for it that people can filter out. But I'm fine with people wanting to know how much progress they've made transitioning which I think is the heart of the question.
So many people still may feel shame etc. which is why I think they feel the need to “pass”, they want to be “real” cis women or “real” cis men. I mean I think it bugs me and other enbys because there isn’t really “passing” as an enby because as soon as you whip out any pronouns other than she or he or any gender other than man or woman, people are like… ope trans, assumed they were AGAB not enby, they pass/don’t pass, etc. I don’t think feeling annoyed by “guess my gender” is exclusive to enbys, but so many cis people (queer or not) are obsessed with the gender binary it’s insane!!
People want to know how they're being perceived by the world... Because, sadly, asking for pronouns is still not a common thing out in the world. People still assume. I personally would like to know how the people outside perceive me...
If it makes you feel any better, almost every one of these threads has a top comment telling people not to do it.  Generally geared toward ""stop trying to hate yourself"" essentially.
I don't really understand why it would be inappropriate to post it here but not on the trans subreddits. There are plenty of trans non-binary people, and non-binary people still live in a world where the gender binary has a lot of impact on our lives. If this subreddit was intended as a space to completely avoid being reminded of that, and had rules about those types of posts, I could understand it being a problem. But if this is more a place for non-binary people to talk about ourselves and our existence in the world, I understand why some people might create those kinds of posts.

I think it's a conflicting access needs issue, where some people need to know how others might perceive them, and other people need to not think about the fact that it's impossible to really pass as non-binary specifically and that people are always assuming binary gender. That doesn't mean either group is wrong for having the needs they have, and because this space as far as I know hasn't declared itself on either side of those needs, neither group is wrong for posting here. It's just causing conflict because the space can't really be safe for both needs at the same time without changes like a flair to avoid those posts (side note: I did not know you could Blacklist flares, thanks)
Look, I want non-queers to be unsure of my gender. I want them to question. 
Having been afab I like it more when non-queers assume amab. But the best would be if they can't figure it out.
While nonbinary people done owe anyone androgyny, I (an presumably other?) nonbinary people want to achieve that. I don't want to ""pass"" as nonbinary, because as you correctly say, there is no such thing. But if I were to ask anyone what they would assume my agab is, it would be on here.
I am not trying to ""pass"" as male. Therefore it doesn't make sense for me to as in a ftm sub. I would be trying to gauge what the majority people would assume about me. And I would specifically ask ""afab or amab"" because it doesnt help me answer my question if people on here say they think my gender is nonbinary or agender.
Also afab or amab doesn't mean feminine or masculine. I could be hyper feminine, and people would still be able to say they think I am amab because there are certain characteristics that come with having a testosterone or estrogen based body system.
ok but have you consider transmasc and transfemme enbies want to be seen as a binary gender?

you shouldn’t be getting this upset at how **OTHER** people are experiencing gender, and it’s not up to you to police this sub and gatekeep what other NBs want to post in a sub that is dedicated to their gender.

if they aren’t forcing binary onto you, than you have no right to say “don’t say this in an non-binary sub”

I want to look like a man, that doesn’t make my gender any less enby.

Don’t be a gatekeeper, it’s shitty
This made me sad. If not this sub, there is no place where I can simply exist without upsetting someone somehow. 

I hope the mods make a flair for this so people can filter it out if they want to.
Yo it's actually wild to me how often trans twitter starts spewing transphobic bullshit. There was that one tweet that went viral where this ""passing"" trans woman was like ""don't ask my pronouns when you know I'm a woman"" and I'm like fam what literally the fuck about people who don't present their ID?

I mean this like even transcends beyond trans people. I know plenty of cis people who are androgynous who get misgendered and hate it.
i have no issue with it. at the end of the day “passing” still matters to others, even if you don’t personally relate. i think a flair would be appropriate.
That’s valid, didn’t mean to induce any dysphoria. I did one post like this cause it felt gender euphoric to me to see most of the comments say anything but A Man. 

Would I get that if asking this question in any other space? Probably not. Most people in my day to day will just assume I’m a cis man, which sucks, but that’s the world we live in for now.
i think its actually nice cause if you know people are confused or guessing wrong then you know you're getting it right. we gotta accept that that is the way most people will see us, in terms of binary- so it gives some people euphoria to know that even if they gender you, they're not unanimous. i love asking people to guess things tho lmao, i just find it really entertaining, especially if both answers are wrong.
I feel like it only exists to dunk on non-passing enbies. I know I'll never 'pass' an enby because I don't want to, but it still makes me feel bad as I don't look like a 'proper' enby with certified androgyny
I never assume something so important
Agreed
Very painfully cringe to see.
THANK YOU yes
I’m so glad someone said it
Yeah this is exactly what I am sad about people doing to me in public so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I think people who post those are maybe testing out new looks in a safe space of enby peers where they can get feedback about how those out in the rest of society might read them. Frankly I think that's totally valid.
⬆️📣
Yes omg. I don't want to be assumed as *anything* because usually people are just wrong lol. People tend to assume i am lesbian because of my style, but i really am bi. And of course they'd assume im a female too. In reality i just do not care what they call me but rather them not assume either way unless they ask.
I literally can't go out in public if strangers can see my chest blobs, I agree about it being triggering. I'm already wearing 3 layers to hide my body, I really don't wanna think about the fact that other people are potentially/constantly trying to ""sus my gender out""

Edit to add that I also agree about your first point re: trans subs
Passing culture is toxic and doesnt make sense in trans subs either. yes I understand the safety and mental health aspects of it but it doesnt make it \*good.\* Passing culture automatically applies gender stereotypes and gendered clothing, furthering shit she dont need.
Thank you for this… I feel like people are too polite or whatever to say what you’ve just said…
Also that there's no such thing as ""passing"" as non-binary. We don't owe anyone androgyny.
100% and I never know what to answer either. I can tell you how I can imagine cisnormative binary people would most likely perceive you but I'll never see any specific gender because I don't care and it'd be weird for me to. I'm masculine and still align with a masculine gender identity but I will never presume that the way I live and interpret masculinity is gonna align with anyone's gender unless they explicitly tell me it does and I find similarities myself.

I wouldn't really assume someone's gender in general but especially not from a picture. That reduces gender to only something aesthetic or physical and it's deeply disrespectful to pretty much everyone with or without a gender identity.
👏👏👏👏👏
Yeah I get what you mean. Basically it's okay to ask if it's certain through context the question is asked in a joking way insisting on a non-binary mindset. For example ""Would you say I'm more of an antisocial hermit wood elf or a dark fairy queen that recently turned evil ?""
I'm transmasculine non-binary here to back you up. We do have different subs and even then cisnormativity can still be a problem and I hear some people complain about it ther too, myself included. In general it's just not cool to project it on people, even in places where attachment to a gender identity and perception is generally expected. 

I have dysphoria, I know real well what it is but people need to realize that certain mindset aren't dysphoria based but a reaction to cishetnormativity being pushed on us and it's not acceptable to perpetuate that on people, non-binary or binary trans. Asking and expecting people to fit in that mindset is not okay. Asking if you pass/could stealth is one thing but ""guess my gender"" really is another.
THIS!!!!!
I answer ""this is masculine/feminine"" to those post because they make me deeply uncomfortable and I'm trying to remove amab/afab from the equation. This is why I switch the term, I think it might be the case for a lot of other people. I'm not saying afab is feminine or amab = masculine in those cases. I'm trying to rephrase the question and then answer it because the original question is problematic and I literally cannot answer it as amab v afab doesn't mean anything to me.  


Just to give some insight to it. I've stopped answering those posts anyway but I thought you might appreciate seeing it from another perspective. Maybe it can alleviate some of the hurt from it.
I couldn't've said it better
Exactly. Preach….
👏👏👏👏
Yeah, and thats the issue, its obvious that people are uncomfortable with the question of ""am i amab or afab"" stuff but people keep doing it
Yeah I find that weird because the post i saw the person had specifically asked like ""how would cis people see me"" and people gave a bunch of cool affirming trans/nonbinary answers which is cool.

But like, the person (who was beautiful and androgynous) had facial hair so 100% cis people will think they are amab and I think we all know that. (LOL this is why I want T so bad but I ain't there yet)

I loved the responses people gave on that post but really didn't like the way OP phrased the question. And I agree with folks who are pointing out its obvious those questions make everyone uncomfortable so we answer a different and better question instead.
It would mean a LOT if there was flair that we could chose not to see, because I am tired of it. Every one of those posts makes me dysphoric and reminds me that people care so much about the binary even in a nonbinary community.

sigh..
The whole passing thing is a big issue but if someone wants to be safe and be in a place where passing is more of an accepted and normalized term, the trans subreddit is perfectly fine.

But I don't really want to get into the whole topic of passing, because I hate it.. theres no way to pass as anything because nothing has rules and thats what we're tryna do but the fact that its seeping into the nonbinary subreddit is just exhausting
The name thing is harmless, I don't see any issue with it and I think its fun to see what people would think your name is. If someone needs name help I don't see why they can't be allowed to post about it to have a fun activity where people throw names around. It also doesn't have years worth of oppression and genocide attached to it
The name thing bothers me too pal - it's ok when people do a poll where you can choose a name from some options but the open ended ""what name suits me?"" questions feel impossible to answer.
Asking people what genitals they think you have is pushing the binary, amab vs afab. And this subreddit isn't the place for it.

But I heavily agree with the flair idea, we should tell the mods
But to ask nonbinary people to assume your gender/sex is counter productive. It's pressuring people to guess within the binary.

I've started responding to those 'assume my gender' posts with ""nonbinary"" because I'm tired of seeing the binary everywhere I go
it does make me feel better, I just want to STOP seeing it on my feed. I'm tired of seeing only ""do I pass?"" stuff from the damn nonbinary subreddit, there's no way to pass as a nonbinary person!!! nonbinary doesnt have a look!!!!!
What is the point of asking nonbinary people? We aren't the best people to ask at all. If you ask what we think your genitals are we're gonna get uncomfortable because why does it matter. We aren't non-queers, so why are you asking us? It doesn't help you or us, we're just perpetuating the unhealthy perception that a non-queer has.

You're right, a nonbinary person would say a nonbinary identity because 1. its the nonbinary subreddit, and 2. we dont see the world as specifically male/masc/penis and female/fem/vagina.

But what you're saying doesn't make sense. There are cis men in the world that don't have enough testosterone and look afab, there are cis women in the world who have lots of testosterone and look amab. What is the purpose of asking when amab and afab doesnt have a look? The ONLY way we could properly guess your genitals is if you flashed the subreddit and please dont. Just ask if you look feminine, masculine, or androgynous because those are descriptors unlike female/male/intersex and agab.
You want to look masculine. Not like a man. You are enforcing the binary that man=masculine and woman=feminine. This is the problem I have.

edit: what do you even mean to say look like a man? what does a man look like? this is the issue. Men dont have a look and neither do women. Man and Woman is literally just a gender identity label, it doesnt come with masculine or feminine. Same with Transman and Transwoman. Transmasc and Transfemme however specifically mean masculine presenting and feminine presenting.

hey if you like memes r/ennnnnnnnnnnnbbbbbby is a lot less gatekeepy and the mods don’t sit on their ass doing nothing while being passive aggressive when you raise a problem
bruh.... 😭... not a trans person hating on people being respectful and asking for pronouns... 😭😭😭😭
There's no such thing as 'passing' as a nonbinary person.
It just feels like the wrong subreddit to ask it on, like maybe the trans subreddit where there are binary folks, but its just not really a place for the binary here
We *dont* have to accept that. We're perpetuating it which is continuing the cycle, if we stop doing it or giving it any thought and educate folks we can move to a future where it doesn't matter.

I don't think the binary belongs anywhere on the nonbinary subreddit.
theres no such thing as 'passing' or 'nonpassing' nonbinary people.
I don’t think the result is that healthy, either for the individual or the community.
Oh my god right?? Or having to wear baggy pants because skinny pants are an IMMEDIATE giveaway. Like just let me wear my cloth bag to hide my shame and stop reminding me people see body parts.
Yeah, it’s kinda one of those things that’s great while you get your feet under you to feel confident enough that whether you “pass” or not, you know who you are and you know you’re <gender> even if you don’t “look” like it on any given day, but it definitely can be too much, you know? Like at a certain point, relying on other people to tell you that you look like who you are is just as bad as listening/taking to heart what bigots and transphobes say about you. It’s just not helpful deep down.
YES. Those stereotypes we’re all trying to dissolve…
This is a good point. Identity is about how you feel.
Yessssssssssss 🤷
that does explain some of it, thank u for taking the time! i mostly meant when ppl say ""[blank] is masculine so i read u as amab"" or vice versa, but thank u again :)
 ooh yeah that’s a good point. it’d be better on an androgyny sub.
Yeah I think it reinforces this idea that we have to be androgynous.
Yes.
Totally agree, it makes little sense to me those posts being on this sub. They are valid needs but here is not the place for it…
Then do that I guess? I don't see anything wrong with guessing ""non-binary"".
I  wouldn't be asking what my genitals are.
I would be asking which of the two binary genders that people usually get assigned by birth I am, according to how society in general perceives them. And I am asking here, because I would feel like other nonbinary people would understand what I am asking and why.
I understand what you're saying about making the binary more prominent as it is. At the same time it is currently a real thing and 99% of people will put me in one category or the other, so I want to know which one to understand what to change about my appearance to maybe not make it as easy for people to box. Every time they fail, they will understand they can't tell someone gender by what someone looks like. We agree on this I guess. Looks != gender. And yet most people will still assume.
Mod u/enbuzz says in their bio they are a “non-binary trans guy” are they enforcing the binary for simply existing? As he is both a trans guy and non-binary?

or do you just want to control what people say or do or think?
I didn’t. Have a good weekend.
Joined. Many thanks.
your individual feelings are of course valid, but they don’t speak for each nonbinary person on earth. passing as A or B matters to some people, and dosent invalidate their nonbinary identity. im amab, passing as afab is important to me, and i am nonbinary. in the nicest way possible, nobody here’s opinions of that make me any less of a nonbinary person.
i'm just saying that while we should definitely educate people towards a future where it doesn't matter, maybe we should acknowledge that we are *not*, right now, in a time where it doesn't matter.
PANTS 🥲 literally lmao like pls do not perceive me
Yeah i'm happy with my looks though to others my genitals probably don't match but i have no  intention to have surgery since it doesn't bring me any discomfort and i don't care to fit a binary female look
Oof yeah never saw those kind of comments. Glad I didn't. I wish we could just drop the agab thing. It's only really necessary in medical circle or if trying to mention childhood.
I'd actually suggest trans or lgbt sub because some folks aren't trying to look androgynous as a nonbinary person.

And for people to stop saying Amab when they mean masc/male or Afab when they mean fem/female
If people want to know how others perceive them then go to the trans subreddit or the lgbt subreddit, folks are forcing others to be witness or subjected to the binary even in the subreddit called NONbinary
Okay but you're asking the worst group because we WONT give you an accurate perception the same of a cis person.

We HAVE the mind of a nonbinary person
Youre gonna.. @ a mod... I call myself a nonbinary dude, i specifically dont call myself a transman because im not a transman.. I may be masc and femme at times but im not a man, nor is it possible for me to look like a man... I can *be* a man if that's what I identified with.

Please don't drag people into this, especially a mod just trying to vibe. You didn't need to question their identity like that like what is your deal?

Transman: Someone who wants to BE a man
Transmasc: Someone who wants to be masculine

Men aren't always masculine, Women aren't always feminine. You can't *look* like a man when you mean masculine.

edit: the way someone labels theirselves is literally none of your or my business
I'm just confused why you're sad about this post? /gen
I never said that? I said that there's literally NO one way to pass as nonbinary, because what you want to see in *yourself* is insanely different from me and others.

It isn't as simple as being a hyper masculine man or being a hyper feminine woman, its nonbinary. It's what ever the hell you want it to be.

It's not my opinion it's fact, you can't pass because there is no way to 'pass'. Nonbinary doesn't have a look.
Okay but we can move towards that future by not giving time about 'passing' and what others perceive you as. It doesn't matter and we can project that into society.
My partner’s dad is a transphobe and decided to not use name or pronouns for me and it was so fucking powerful, like yes if you can’t do it right don’t fucking do it at all. I will be an orb in the ether.
Yep there's r/TransMasc or r/transfem . I'm on the TransMasc one and it's a very cool place with non-binary people. Met a few others on there.

As for the second part: YESSSSSSS
forcing you to witness the binary? my god, calm down.

and I say that as a non binary person.
Yes I agree with that to a point. I am nonbinary and I try not to see gender and not assume.
But I am also attracted to women. Doesn't mean I can't tell when a man isn't pretty. The same way a nonbinary person can probably tell me which of the two binary genders I mostly would be considered as.
And I rather have fellow NBs tell me than ask cis people who'd be mean about it or binary trans people who'd assume I want to hear one thing or the other.
odd how you got pissy at that and yet you were doing it to other people by making this post, including tell me what i *actually* identify as

rules for you but not for me i’m guessing?

and i’m not questioning their identity, don’t twist my words to suit your stupid bullshit gatekeeping

edit: and yet you made everyone’s business yours by making this post
All I’m saying is some nonbinary people want to pass as A or B.
well i wish i was that optimistic about the future

I am calm?

I don't think its unreasonable for me to ask for the binary to not be present on a subreddit called nonbinary.

You saying you're a nonbinary person in attempts to make me sound unreasonable and 'not calm' is something I think you should think about. Do you really want to spend your time telling another nonbinary person to deal with it?

Making amab and afab the new 'male' and 'female' is the exact same thing. I want people to drop it and stop hating themselves and subjecting others to this toxic idea that there is either amab or afab.
But Nonbinary people can do the exact same thing as binary trans people.. tell you what you want to hear. If you want the hard mean unfiltered truth that is what you'll face against non queer people you gotta ask non queer people.

Asking trans/nonbinary people honestly just seems like a schrodingers circle jerk that goes nowhere, and serves no true purpose other than to perpetuate the binary and create an uncomfortable/tense environment
You say you want to look like a man. What does a man look like? Please tell me.
Okay? That's fine, but it doesn't mean it's okay for them to push the binary onto the community
Amab or Afab is just another PC way to say 'male' or 'female' at this point and it frustrates me
You can be. You're chosing to be pessimistic.
""toxic""

The mere existance of amab and afab ain't toxic. It gets toxic once people get pushed into certain boxes and gender stereotypes...
I agree with you in so far as when people ask and all the answer are ""assigned cute at birth"". Didn't help at all, even if it was cute and I see that happening the majority of the time tbf
idk dude what do cis men look like? since you are dictator of all non-binary identities, you tell me what cis men look like? Because that’s how men look like to me.

also “afab and amab are just pc terms for male and female” lol are you a troll or do you have control issues that everyone has to bow down to and follow your shitty truscum behaviour
Well I don’t nessecarily agree that it’s “pushing” anything onto the community. We as nonbinary people should be supportive, understanding, and accepting of each other. If a nonbinary person wants to dress femme and be perceived as female then that’s their truth. If you don’t want to live your life like that, then okay, don’t. But we shouldn’t be judging and pushing away others who are just trying to live as their most authentic self. Honestly I’m shocked at this thread. An extremely invalidating experience.
yes because i *enjoy* being depressed about the state of our world and that ill never be who i want to be. you have no idea what it's like here. please respect that i don't see what you see in society, i'd rather non-binary just be accepted as a real gender first. 

And yes I- and probably many people- don't have the natural self confidence to just not care what others percieve you as. Just let people ask if they're androgynous or not (because as far as I can tell that is the real reason those posts are made- just in a bit of a roundabout way). Besides- gender expression isn't even the same as gender- plenty of non-binary people can want to look like a binary gender and that doesn't make them any less non-binary.
It IS toxic because when most people are asking ""do I look amab or afab?"" they mean ""do I look masculine or feminine?"" respectively.

It's the binary!
Which is why people avoid answering the posts because its UNCOMFORTABLE and doesnt belong on this subreddit
That's what I'm asking you. Cis men can VERY well look like what people assume women to look like, we can see that in drag. Cis men have long hair, short hair, big bodies, small bodies, cis men can have large chests, cis men can have small chests, cis men can be feminine, cis men can be masculine, cis men can be androgynous. Cis men come in so many different shapes and sizes, some cis men get misgendered because people think they're women because of the harmful social binary.

What I'm saying is that men don't have a look, you can't look like a man because there isn't one 'look'. You can be a man, and if you are a man then you automatically look like a man. Same goes for women and all sorts of Nonbinary people. Its a gender identity, not gender expression.

Gender identity: Man, Woman, Nonbinary etc.
Gender expression: Androgynous, Masculine, Feminine etc.

You're gonna call me a truscum? Do you know what a truscum is?

I'm not gatekeeping anything. I'm not saying who can and can't be nonbinary because there are no rules dictating a nonbinary person. The harmful binary is that men=masculine=penis and women=feminine=vagina. This is what afab and amab is, people need to stop using the wrong terminology and stop using amab and afab as a descriptor. Using Masculine, Feminine, and Androgynous is much more appropriate.
Saying ""cis men look like men"" as your definition is like really fucking gross and transphobic
Trans men with no medical transition are still men, and they still ""look like men"". Because they are men. There is no one way for a man to look.

You are totally missing the point of this post, read the other comments for some perspective. 

op is not saying that all NB people have to look androgynous. They are saying that these posts reinforce harmful shit and they absolutely do and almost everyone in the comments agrees. 

You are the one who needs to ""calm down"" and who is taking offense at something that wasn't targeted at you.
If anyone wants to be perceived as anything good for them, but that doesnt mean they get to ask ""do i look amab or afab"" when they really mean ""do i look masculine or feminine?"" or ""do i look like a man or a woman?""

Move it to the trans subreddit. The binary has no place in the nonbinary community, I have no problem with people wanting to be perceived as binary in society but still identify as nonbinary, like that's good for them that they found something that works. But then going and bringing that perceived binary into the *nonbinary* community is toxic and takes us back so many steps.

If someone wants to know if theyre perceived in a binary way go to the trans/lgbt subreddit, not the nonbinary subreddit. I don't want to see the binary perception integrated into the nonbinary community
I have no idea what its like to be 'here'?... As in... in the world?? We're on the same planet, I face transphobia/misgendering/hate constantly. I just try not to focus on it all the time. Yes it exists but thats not all there is.

People ARENT asking if they're fem/masc/andro is the issue, they're asking ""what binary gender do you see me as""

edit: also how do you enjoy being depressed....
You need to stop using the word ""toxic"" for things that just piss you off.

""Oh I don't like this thing. Must be toxic.""

Transphobes are toxic. The existance of cis people is not...
Is it uncomfortable because one doesn't want to tell someone they look probably not the way they want to look, or because it's genuinely uncomfortable? On binary trans subs people often request no hug boxing, and also the ""objective"" is very clear. It's not that easy on here.
Your comments are harmful. Your post is harmful. There are enbies who live a life entirely different from you. You need to realise that and get over it.

And don’t pretend I didn’t see you mocking a trans woman in another comment. Yes what she said was shitty but you and the other commenter had no right to be transphobic and put passing in quotation marks. 

I know men can vary, I want to look like a feminine man. But darling, 

**I WAS BORN WITH A VAGINA AND UTERUS! THAT MEANS I WAS ASSIGNED FEMALE AT BIRTH OR AFAB! I WANT TO LOOK LIKE A FEMININE MAN AND I AM NON-BINARY! YOUR GENDER DYSPHORIA IS NOT THE SAME AS MY GENDER DYPSPHORIA! I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU GETTING DYSPHORIC OVER ME REFERRING TO MYSELF! THAT IS A YOU PROBLEM THAT YOU NEED TO GET HELP FOR! I AM NOT GONNA CHANGE MY IDENTITY AND THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE YOU ARE OVER CONTROLLING OVER STRANGER’S LIVES! IF NO ONE IS CALLING YOU AMAB OR A MAN OR WHATEVER THAN ALL THIS POST IS SAYING “NO ONE CALLED ME THIS BUT I DONT LIKE IT SO IM GONNA POLICE HOW YOU TALK ABOUT YOURSELVES”**

You’re exhausting
""here"" means places where pride is illegal :) you can also be arrested for being gay cause you're likely anti-government. no gender neutral gender markers - changing your name legally is next to impossible

and i honestly don't see much of a difference they're essentially asking the same thing - there's definitely some difference obviously but it feels like quibbling, maybe they didn't phrase it perfectly but we all should know what they mean, what's the difference?
I don't think you understand what I'm saying.

Asking if you look male or female on a NONBINARY subreddit is toxic.

It's toxic because this ISNT a binary subreddit and it's not the place to ask.
Its uncomfortable because you're asking Nonbinary people who get misgendered/invalidated constantly about their identity to do the exact same thing.

Noone wants to assume your sex, because its hurtful if they assume wrong.
I am in constant danger of being abducted and murdered in my area, it is a huge problem and happens all the time. I may not be in direct danger of the government, but there at alt right people everywhere and my life is always on eggshells.

Don't talk to me like I don't fear for my life every time I go out into public. I've been cornered by a group of men, I've been harassed. I have had my life threatened. Don't you dare talk over me and invalidate my experiences because you also have it hard.

I'm not continuing this discussion because you are insanely disrespectful and I can't believe you who claims to live somewhere where you can be jailed for your orientation ASSUMES I live in a place where trans people can run freely and frolic and be open and be secure in their safety.

It might not be written in the law that it's illegal to be trans where I live, but that doesn't stop police from brutalizing us.
You are putting non binary into a third box. And THIS is toxic. You do realize that it is an umbrella term? You do realize that non binary includes gender fluid, demiboys, demigirls and so many more? You do realize that some people want to present more female and others more male? Sure, some want to present genderneutral (that's what I would like to look like too btw). But not all non binary people are the same and some want to present leaning more towards one direction.

So stop putting them all into one box. Some literally want that. Not everyone wants to present completely neutral.
I'm sorry you felt disrespected that was the last thing I ever intended. I know I come off wrong sometimes and I know I'm not the best at communicating well but I can't see what I've said wrong. And I've been gaslit too many times to know whether I did come off wrong so I'll rephrase. I just keep trying to clarify my argument because I thought you didn't understand. I think you're optimistic. And I think that's a good quality. I wish I was that way. Just as I said. It's just an honest opinion. No sarcasm intended, right? You did *not* have to invalidate my fears by saying its my *choice*. Nobody *chooses* to feel misery. I understand that you don't know me but that's an awful thing to say to *anyone,* especially unprompted like that. I probably should have stopped it there. I brushed it off because I hope you didn't mean it like that but I don't know if anything I said came off as disrespectful after that because your response there was really inappropriate.

Do I not have a right to be scared because of the laws that were passed in my country and even the way you're treated in yours? Do I not have a right to feel that nothing will get better if we don't focus on the important legal things first? And I'm sorry that I assumed you were in better conditions, I shouldn't have, but you really have no idea what it's like here. It might not be worse necessarily, but society is different- and the ideas and environment they have is different. Everyone's view of the planet and society at large differs based on who they meet how they grow up. 

Yes, I'll be the first to  admit I've never been harassed, and I'm very sorry you went through that but that doesn't mean I don't know about the murder rates and the harassment anyway- it doesn't mean I don't feel like I'm on eggshells- and it doesn't mean I don't find myself sad at the fact that I'll never be able to be legally my own gender or probably even out in public. I'm probably so much more scared than I ought to be based on any reality too. It's more the legality and the thought of powerlessness that scares me, I was never talking about experiences specifically just that constant oppressive fear. I'm fucking terrified of being murdered or assaulted- I might even just live my live as a binary person for all intents as purposes because of it, no matter how much dysphoria. And the chances? By god they're probably so low. But I'm so fucking scared. All the time. It gets to you. Being scared to put rainbow stickers on notebooks, being told not to draw rainbows- it gets to you. The entire society says you're not accepted here and that's not gonna change. The fact that nothing will change even legally until the government changes- and that it probably won't happen. 

And how can you say I'm disrespecting you? That's the last thing I ever intended. You just implied I was *lying* about some of the things I've said I find really distressing. Did you not understand that when I said it, that this is something that genuinely makes me very sad? I really want to hope you didn't but I honestly don't know what to think any more. And I honestly truly can't empathize with your ability to be so optimistic, especially in the environment you described, I'm sorry- but don't make that my problem. Everyone's feelings are valid- that includes yours and mine.
Them? I am nonbinary, I'm not putting us into a box, I'm asking people to STOP using the boxes in a place where boxes don't exist.

Yes people can dress and present how ever the fuck they want! Kill it, pack it, and put a bow on it, you look great! But male doesnt mean masculine, female doesnt mean feminine. The whole point of nonbinary is that we are not limited by the societal constrictions of ""man has penis and is masculine"" and ""woman has vagina and is feminine"". Women can be masculine and have penises, Men can be feminine and have vaginas. Why do we need to push the binary?

Amab and Afab ≠ Masculine/male Feminine/female and that is exactly how it's being used on this subreddit"	q42sjk	NonBinary	865	0.99	2021-10-08 17:42:49
It’s funny, normal masculine clothes gives me some dysphoria as I’m AMAB but vintage men’s clothes give me a hella lot of euphoria?!? Here’s my look from yesterday 💛		"Vintage men's clothes are superior because they weren't afraid of colors! and patterns! It's seriously a good look though!
All emotions are weird. Because like I won’t where shirts that say that I went somewhere because I feel like I’m so showing off, yet l’ll bring my $500 headphones everywhere just fine
You look fabulous! yellow is a good color on you💛
You are seriously rocking those golden tones!!! 🤩

The euphoria is coming all the way through my screen, it’s like the opening scene of Saturday night fever. I want to walk down the street with you
I usually like vintage clothes because it feels like those clothes aren't gendered the same way as more modern clothes. I've worn so many older styles of clothes and had people legitimately not be able to tell which gender I was presenting as. 😆 Which I loved.
I think someone else said it but the patterns and colors being brighter is a factor.

You can't gender a rainbow or a neon outfit!
I can’t believe those yellow pants! I def agree that vintage men’s is where it’s at!!
I’m an AFAB and I’ve always adored vintage men’s fashion. Argyles, plaids, paisleys- so many amazing colors too! Btw love the shoes!
I'm like this with fantasy clothes. Normal dresses? Ew. Fantasy/Renaissance dress? Hell yes! I will also go for the occasional fantasy inspired dress, like I have one covered in d20s, and three with dragons. Sometimes retro is ok to. But do not give me some flowery/overly lacey thing. No thanks.
Ohoo wow yeah I get it! You're looking rather mischievous here very gender
I'm in the same boat. Lots of... baggage... involving suits and ties, but give me rolled sleeves on a button-up and a vest and MmmHmm~~
Love the mid-century modern energy. It's great that you look good and feel affirmed!
\*in a whisper\* 

those shoes.... my precious.... where have they found those shoes...
You look very dapper
Hello! You hella rocking this.
classy 💁
Men had some periods of legit style, it’s just that the ‘80s-00s were a fashion desert for men
You really pull that look off
Your gender is vintage
That fit has a stunning pallet. The whole pic does, really
\*ringring\*

\*ringring\*

Oh hi, this is the seventies. We wish to make a complaint. When people in your era dress in outfits from people in our era there's supposed to look like dweebs, not like this slick, chic enby we see before us.
You look awesome! 👍
Your wallpaper makes you look like you have elf ears! Was fully willing to accept you were just some fairy trying to blend in with society.
You look great, love the yellow
For some reason I am reminded of Rick Astley. 

But this outfit looks amazing on you, I love the summery vibes too🌞
Omg your style plus the wallpaper and credenza..... this photo is dripping with vintage swag
such a cool look!
Everything about this picture is so joyful!
I just gotta say you look fantastic and so at peace with yourself 😊 Your look also makes me think of [Chris Fleming](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uKKSDu_a9ik), a lovely nb comedian/songwriter.
Where did you get those shoes?!? I love them, but it's impossible to find any in my size when I occasionally look.
I see it as that modern men's clothes are made for what society currently expects men to wear. No one's expecting a man to dress the way you are in this picture so, while the clothing is obviously masculine, it's not what's expected and falls into the ball of non-conformity that is being non-binary.
You looks amazing!!
Very dapper!
You remind me of [this really cool dude](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
Exactly right!!! Modern men’s clothes are just dull
Ahh yeah
Yeah, but a tee-shirt saying ""I went here"" is the week-long trip version of being someone who will tell you they know *all* about life in Cambodia because they spent two months there on their gap year. It implies a level of cultural involvement that isn't really there. But going around with decent headphones says ""I like my music. Please talk to me about it when these are not over my ears."" Whatever your tastes in music are there's already an *actual* cultural connection.
It really does! I love yellow
Yaasss
Exactly! I love the androgynous look of vintage outfits as you can style them as masc or fem!!!
Oh yeah!
Same! Thank you so much
The shoes are killer. I like wearing big, big boots all the time but even I want a pair of them to spice things up a bit.
Holy shit. I just realized that I don’t feel dysphoric in RenFest outfits but I do in “modern” dresses. Huh. Brains are weird.
❤️❤️❤️
Yup!
Thank you so much!
I got them from Depop 😄
Thank you so much!
Thank you ❤️
Thank you!
Yeah my deadline for vintage fashion is the 1970s
Oh thank you!
Yes, I am vintage
Yaasss
A slick, chic enby…that’s me!
Thank you!
Omg yeah!!!
Me too! I love yellow 💛
Oh yes!!
That’s what I was aiming for!
Thank you ☺️
💛💛💛💛
Omg yeah!!! 😍
I got them from Depop!
So true!
Thank you!
Thanks!
I hate Rick Astley.
Agreed. I live by Ian Dury's only new boots and panties credo. If there's anything interesting in men's fashion today (if) then you're guaranteed to have a slow trickle of in into charity shops over the next year.
David Bowie knew the drill! He's kind of my style icon lol
Yessss!!!
Yaasss
Why restrict yourself? Hey I'm sure there's plenty of other...

\*looks at patched denim jacket\*

\*looks at boots, braces, polo shirt, and turned up jeans they are currently wearing\*

\*thinks about how rarly they stray from those margins\*

... never mind.
Thanks! I'll have the check them out. Hopefully they have something similar in my size.
sadge, have a good rest of your day tho
Hell yes!!!!
The brand name of my shoes are “Office”

gotta love spreading support and love 😵‍💫		"When I first came out as non-binary, I was all like, ""No, the goatee is staying!"" And it did, until I got a sudden rush of dysphoria looking in the mirror one day and shaved before I even thought it through. But that's me, and I love it when enbies show off their makeup and dresses with their full beards. What works for them does not work for me, but nobody should be able to force that on them because \*I\* got dysphoria over it. I'm now getting to the point where I don't have to shave every time I leave the house, and I can accept that even now, as a trans femme enby, I will have stubble for half the week.

(My skin hates shaving, but I'm 52, grey, and laser and IPL do not work on grey hair, and ain't nobody got money for electrolysis!)
He also completely disregards that there are non-binary people and that they  may have a different experience than binary trans people.

I personally don't want to pass as anything. I want to go on hormones and have top surgery and look like a 'typical man', looking like a woman gives me a lot of dysphoria. But I'm still non-binary. I just want to pass as myself and that is how I feel I should look like. I don't want to be seen as a binary man though. 

Everyone is different :)
I hate my body and you don’t hate yours and I’ve decided that’s a you problem!!
Sure, having a beard will generally make people assume someone is a man. That doesn't mean that person cannot be trans tho, wtf?
Someone took all the yikes pills this morning.

And they seem to be confusing societal associations with certain human anatomy with gender presentation. The two do influence each other but - buddy get this - some cis women grow facial hair and choose not to shave it. 

Let’s also not overlook intersex people here.

As a general rule, don’t push your opinions, beliefs or expectations on what someone does with their body or feels about their body onto anyone.

In any situation.

Ever.
How can one be trans and gatekeep being able trans? They ain’t even good at it ffs
Ciswomen develop beards. PCOS and genetics are a huge factor in hair growth, like wtf. This needless policing of gender dysphoria.
Truscum are so sad. They really hate themselves and refuse to let go of internalized transphobia. They’re like maybe if I flog myself hard enough the cishet normativity boot will step on me less. Newsflash, the bills trying to keep us out of bathrooms and sporting don’t have a note in parentheses that says (except truscum). 

I feel bad for them honestly. Trans joy is everything, they should try it sometime.
Oh cool. I love it when idiots act like they know what they’re taking about (sarcasm). Sorry you had to deal with that. :\
I love it how people without medical degrees think they can define and diagnose a complex condition like gender dysphoria and then describe --completely-- how it impacts someone with it.And then, as they lose their shit when they get called out, tell everyone *else* lhow stupid they are. Um...? Good times.
I don't get how you can feel more comfortable in your skin 😡 (basically)
I'm sick of hearing that trans people have to hate themselves to be trans. It's an act of self-love and authenticity to transition, not a symptom of how much we hate ourselves. Many trans ppl experience dysphoria but our identities aren't defined by that
The fuck? Oh, I I've looked at the cost benifit analysis of surgery and hormones and decided even the best case scenario results don't justify that ordeal *in my personal case*, and there's some comfort to be found in working with/claiming the body I'm stuck with. Guess my identity is fake.
Some days I don't have chest dysphoria. Some days I do. I stopped HRT cause well money and I just am comfortable with the permanent changes. I Sometime wear dresses, skirts and makeup.
Does this make me not trans now? 
Idk why this person is sitting there saying you must hate you body the same way I do to be trans. Like tf?
Some people experience things differently. No need to gatekeep like that. I think they need to do some self reflection.
average r\truscum user
Ah, truscum! 

Yeah, I don’t have voice dysphoria, I’m still trans. 

I mean, I’ve got dysphoria in plenty of ways. It just hits different for all of us. Doesn’t matter though as far as being trans. We’re still trans! 

Nothing that person can do about it. I suppose they could get mad. They can grasp as hard as they can to patriarchal ideas of gender. They can say some folks don’t belong if they don’t fit their idea of “trans-ness.” 

Seems a bit exclusionary to me. Weird, I think there is an acronym we use for a group of anti-trans folk with that word in it, “exclusion.” Huh, I don’t know. Maybe it’s “radical” of me to compare them to a group who is supposed to be inclusive of trans folk by definition of their own ideology, but then feel threatened because trans-ness is too “different.”

Either way, folks who don’t have dysphoria who are trans are still gonna be trans! Nothing they can do about it. That at least brings me comfort. I suppose the point is, you’re valid. And so is every lovely trans person who deals with dysphoria in a nuanced way, or not at all!
As a fellow trans with a beard I appreciate you <3
For me, I mainly have dysphoria from my voice being masculine and me just have hair around almost everywhere making me feeling like a gorilla (other big dysphoria areas for me where my feet and the thing between my legs) but I’m fine with having nipples so I’m just in a weird position.
I think the word for people who believe that you can only be trans if you have dysphoria is transmeds or something and they're dumb af.
Don't bother arguing with transmeds. They're idiots.
*you gotta love the truscums...*
Well, they are just being ididotic, because, that is how you want to look and you look fab all the time so never listen to them and keep being the amazing you you are!
I’ll be the first to say that I used to believe that too, I thought that others identities somehow invalidated my own. But actually through Brennen Beckwith’s videos where they spoke out about Kalvin Garrah and his gatekeeping of what it means to be trans, I realised this mindset was the reason it took me so long to come out as nonbinary. Because I thought not wanting hrt (at the time) meant that my dysphoria couldn’t possibly be real. But I was struggling severely. This person is unfortunately still stuck with this thought process. Hurt people hurt people. All we can do is love and support each other and hope that light we create can help guide those through their pain. May be cringy to say it like that, but that’s how I feel. 💜
OP just wanted to say I’m sorry you went through this. No one should ever invalidate your identity or experience, ESPECIALLY within our own community.
I recently realized I’m non-binary. First thing I did was shave my beard off. Instantly knew it was the wrong move and it’s coming back. Everyone’s different.
Crazy when people think the point of being trans is to “pass.” Some of us will never pass, some of us don’t care to, it shouldn’t be a requirement to hate our bodies and be scared to present however we feel comfortable
I truly empathize with people who have extreme dysphoria but how can you not understand everything is on a spectrum and some people will not have the same level of dysphoria as other people. Also I'm sure these same people have no issue with cis women not shaving if they can grow facial hair.
Man if facial hair automatically makes you male I wonder what this person thinks of all the folks with PCOS who have sensitive skin and cant shave. 🤔 But in all seriousness, I do hope this person eventually understands that the trans experience is very personal and therefore very different for each individual.

Heck, I'm a femme presenting enby with PCOS who's currently pregnant. That didn't stop my euphoria from being told by my partner an outfit I was wearing was very masculine the other day. Some days I'm okay with my facial hair, others I hate it. 

People like that are sad and bitter and I always hope they get the growth and maturity to learn and grow to be better people.
I honestly will never understand why they think wanting to pass is a requirement to be trans

Their logic doesn't hold up the moment you try to apply them to cis people. a cis woman can look like a man, have muscle, never shave and have masculine hobbies, and even produces more testosterone than average and no one will question her if she's actually a woman

A cis man who likes to wear make up? That's just a regular guy. A trans man that likes make up? A trans trender how dare he engages in anything remotely feminine
nbs must wear gray jumpers, clear nail polish (no colors! no bare nails!) Medium length hair, a SMALL tasteful brass pride flag pin, exactly ONE tennis weight gold necklace, an analog watch with brown leather strap and sensible shoes.   


such a great idea to just end up inventing another wretched set of random gender standards as if two were not enough.
Hot take: concepts of ""passing"" as a trans person are rooted in western patriarchal beauty standards and should be rejected as a necessary step for transition. (That is to say, if it's something you want - go for it. But it is not going to be a part of everyones journey.) There are cis people that ""look"" like the opposite gender naturally and don't identify as such. Are they less cis? Objectively, no. They ARE likely to be ridiculed for their appearance and made fun of regardless for being too masculine or too feminine or incongruous with their AGAB. ""(*""But wait!! I thought gender is what's in your pants!? Why do transphobes ridicule non-passing cis people?""* Because it was never actually about sex and gender, it is about power and marginalization and ""othering"".)

Nobody owes anyone a specific appearance, and if someone is happy with who they are, despite whether or not their appearance lines up with the beauty standard picture of that specific identity, then they are doing a lot better than most people on earth in terms of self esteem - cis, trans, or otherwise.

This is more or less how I've come to make peace with being a non-passing trans person who is likely to never ""pass"".
I really don’t get it why some people are so idiotic. They have no idea what other people go through in their lives and want to tell them how to live, what to do and what not.

If someone thinks they are trans, so, let them **be** that. I mean who better to know than the person in question? Why not just let them discover their lives, and at most, help them when help is asked for.

Come on, we are all trying to muddle through this thing called “live”. It didn’t come with a manual, you know, we all have to figure this “thing” out ourselves…

I wish people would just leave others in peace. So, what if that said person discovers, after some time, that they are, indeed, **not** trans? So, f***ing what? Did they take something away from me? No! Did they hurt me? No! So, WTF???

Sorry for the rant. This just drives me really, really crazy from time to time.

Love you all.
🥰😘
Isn’t it weird how cis people just get to be cis, but we have to go through all these different tests?
Your perception of someone is within your own control. So, when someone asks to be perceived a certain way, it is up to you to have the personal integrity to respect their best wishes. Misgendering, both unintentional and intentional, is always the fault of the perceiver. It just matters whether or not you can take accountability for your faults. Remember that trans people owe the world nothing. Men don't owe masculinity, women don't owe femininity, and enbies don't owe androgyny.
I BELIEVE THIS “…” THEREFORE EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD BELIEVE WHAT I BELIEVE!!! OTHERWISE UR A FRAUD IF U DONT AGREE WITH MUHHH - *them* (mwuahaha)
""To be a part of our club, you have to hate every waking moment of your life while also encouraging others like us to do the same. If you fall outside of these very narrow parameters, at best you're a faker, at worst you're just trying to fuck us.""
Ah trans meds. I can't imagine how shit they must feel about themselves with that shitty world view.

I'm guessing this is a mainstream LGBT subreddit?
People get dysporic over diffrent things too.
If someone is totally okay with a beard but get disporic about certain clothes thats the same experience but from difrent thing.

Also gender roles are not the same as gender.

And trans and nb people dont owe you shit. They dont need to look a certain way to be valid.

Feeling comfortable is a just as valid goal as passing as a certain gender.
Them: ''YOU CAN'T BE A FEMALE IF YOU DON'T FEEL DYSPHORIC ABOUT YOUR BEARD!!!!!1!!!1''

Cis women with beards who don't mind having facial hair: hhmmm
Lmao it's like ""sorry my idea of being nonbinary doesn't include looking youthful and completely androgynous."" Some of us have no intentions with gender presentation at all. Idgaf if you say I'm a woman, man, alien, or whatever. I just want to exist outside of the stupid gender binary that society likes to push. Gendering myself feels like gendering a coffee table or a toaster, you could, it just feels out of place. I feel human and I do have dysphoria, but that hardly has anything to do with giving a fellow human the respect of not shitting on them or telling them how they feel is objectively wrong. All feelings are objectively true and it's stupid we have had to spend generations justifying them. It's created a culture that makes it so we have to justify already true statements, it's redundant and doesn't make any sense to me. 

That's not even including the conversation in privlage. I couldn't even afford gender affirming care if I wanted it right now. I have $0 to spend on surgery, laser hair removal, and hormones. I live in a state that doesn't even cover a breast reduction on medicaid so that's not a viable route either. 

It's so weird how much people can't just let other people be happy and live their life without some sort of criticism or bitter words.
Found out my cousin was like them. They started to deadname my best friend because ‘he wasn’t transitioning fast enough so he must be pretending.’ I already didn’t talk to her much but when my bff told me that I have blocked her and told my family that I won’t attend anything she is at.
I hate my facial hair so I'm always happy for an enby who likes there's lol
Literally got bullied back into the closet by a terrible trans person like this one when I was 14 bc I didn't have dysphoria (ofc I didn't, I was a child with no secondary sex characteristics yet, I dorky really have anything to be dysphoric about) she was the worst person I'd ever met and I'm so angry she basically forced me back into the closet for over 4 years, the most painful 4 years of my life I think

(Obviously I hold no resentment towards other trans women, she was just a terrible person, her transness had nothing to do with it)
I don't understand the passion that transmed people have for squashing the joy of other trans people and policing their experiences. Dumb af, unproductive, and full of internalized transphobia. Bit sad innit? 

Keep your facial hair and whatever else feels good to you. You're right that there's no right or wrong way to be trans and being trans is about gender euphoria and queer joy, not medical procedures and dysphoria!!
I personally love the beard and think it's beautiful and I still see you as feminine idk what they're problem is
Only the truly ignorant consider themselves experts.

(Not you the other person.)
I hate the cookie cutter trans people that attempt to put other ppl in a box. Dysphoria can be handled whichever way the person experiencing it feels like handling it, there is no one path to euphoria and I wish they’d get that through their thick ass skulls.
i used to be similar to this person when i was 14/15, fell into the truscum trap. although i still believe you'd need some level of dysphoria to be trans, i really dgaf about neopronouns/xenogenders and what level of dysphoria that needs to be. i dont care about other peoples labels because it doesnt bother me. being truscum is honestly horrendous lol, they'll claim they dont need cisgender approval yet bash ""transtrenders"" (can we please just let this term die already) because they ""make the trans community look like a joke!! they wont take us seriously and we'll get our rights stripped away"" soo you're appealing to who? the non-trans community? thats literally cis people. 

also ""we dont hate nb people we dont know why tucutes spread so much misinfo"" if you check they have a ""is nb real"" post every few days, its why i got sick of their shit and left. straight up had people bash nb people for transitioning using t because ""why would you want to look like a man??"" yet if an afab nb person doesnt want to transition they're a ""trender"". you cant win with these people and honestly most of them will grow out of it, they're like 14-18 (you can see the poll where they ask peoples age) and once they have less free time they wont have time to worry about this shit. just basing how i was at that age, i genuinely hated myself and had low self-esteem. i cared way too much what other people thought about me. now idc. 14 y/o truscum he/him jason version of me would hate me but hey thats character development.
I love having a beard realistically, it's a fun piece of me to stylize and play with, not to mention the fact that I really suit it.

Sometimes I get really off about having facial hair, or I'd keep undercut rather than growing everything out, however I've come to realise that whilst I do suit the clean shaven undercut look (which I do sometimes like dgmw), the only reason I lean more towards it, is the fact that it makes me look more noticeably queer... 

Only reason I avoided certain looks was because I didn't want to be clocked as ""a man"" by every single person that sees me. And I'm mostly over that now, growing everything out to be a bearded, long haired badass, and even trying to bulk out a bit even though it's a pain in the ass seeing as I'm 6'3 and have a metabolism worthy of being a flash villain :')
Omg spotted the truscum

Also, fun fact, [some cis women have beards](https://www.allure.com/story/women-with-pcos-facial-hair-beard-interviews)
I had dysphoria over having periods and having to shave. Wanted to cry when I shaved my legs and I was suicidally depressed during my periods. Now that that’s taken care of I’m happy and only thing is now I might wanna get rid of my chest. Yeah I haven’t had as severe dysphoria as other trans people but it exists and it’s different.
It's annoying to me that we fight among ourselves and that we deem that there is a wrong way and a right way to be trans, everyone is different and everyones experience in life is different. Everyone goes through things differently and also the factors in they're life play a big part too. Plenty of people see colors differently, I can look at the same flower as my sister and we could both see it as a different color but we will never exactly know how how the other sees it no matter how hard we try. There is no one exact way to be trans. When you have a cold you may not have all the symptoms of a cold. Just because you don't have all they symptoms doesn't mean you don't have a cold.
I believe dysphoria (like most phenomena in life tbh) is a spectrum, and can fluctuate for some. Just as some binary trans people have very strong dysphoria and are extremely uncomfortable with anything related to their birth sex, other people may have less, or be uncomfortable with some things and not others, and it’s up to them how they interpret that for themselves. Gender dysphoria isn’t an all or nothing scenario, hence the existence of non binary people. Just because you may not be suffering in the most extreme way possible doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be able to do anything to minimise the suffering you do experience, and maximise your own comfort and happiness.
The ONLY requirement I need to see for you to be trans is you say you are trans. I don't care what you look like, how you dress, your voice, your pronouns, etc. If you tell me what you want to be called I promise I will try my best to honour you.

Look at me. I experienced dysphoria, and now that I identify as non-binary, even though virtually nothing about my body has changed, just presenting myself that way has helped me. Who knows, maybe I'll get gender (unaffirming? deaffirming?) surgery if I think I need it. I definitely want to get the body hair I despise with my heart and soul lasered off eventually.

Not even your motive, if you want to call it that, or reasoning to become trans, enby, etc. matters to me. The reason I'm non-binary is because gender roles make me horrible uncomfortable. That is not to say I don't like gender roles; feel free to fill them, but don't you dare enforce them on anyone but you.
Really who cares if you have dysphoria or not. Just be you and be comfortable with yourself! Look the way you want to, dress the way you want to, don't let Society tell you what to look like.
I know ever since I've been more open of myself and looked at myself as a Nb person I've started to love myself and not see myself as birth sex. Tho I still get big dysphoria. But hopefully in the next few years I'll be getting rid of that or just toning it down to a level I can handle.
Now if only my mum could see me for who I am. 😔
I’ve always had a very deep masculine voice and have never had a problem growing a full beard even as a 20yo but because of how I’ve been raised I’m forced to feel bad for being me and I’ve considered getting laser hair removal and vocal reconstruction just to make people stop judging me for dressing feminine and wearing makeup when I sound and look like a man. I hate it
Truscum moment 🤮
bless you ❤
yikesssssss
Omg
Everyone's so obsessed with all these stipulations about gender identity. I typically stay away from many communities online for reasons such as this. Gender is a construct, albeit a personal one. How you identify shouldn't need any requirements.
[removed]
I'm AFAB. My tits rarely (not never!) give me dysphoria. I am still nonbinary because 'no gender markers' is not the only way to be NB, it's just one way of presenting. I'm sure there are cis women who don't reduce their identity to their tits as well. I just don't get why people can't... just let that be?
Sounds like those people who also feel like there is no possible way for same-sex couples to be happy. Like if you think passing is the standard for what gender you are, then 5$ says that the one who wrote it doesn't conform to their gender's ""media ideal beauty standards"" and is just super salty and insecure about their own body.
I get dysphoria from my deep voice sometimes and other times I get dysphoria from my badly still developing titties.

Sometimes I have euphoria from my deep voice and other times from my chest. 

I'm less dysphoric about my genitals than I was in the past though, and less dysphoric about my face and hair. 
But quite honestly though, I've always felt weird about my chest, even before HRT.
""it would be like if I had my tits out at all times and insisted on being called a man""

which is exactly what I do, in fact, because the last time I wore a binder I ended up having a massive asthma attack in the middle of a parking lot. 

ignore idiots OP, I'm sure you look fly and dyaphoria's a hell of a beast for anyone 💓
EWWWWWWWWWWWWW TRUSCUM TRASH! 

I've had the same argument thrown at me as a fem leaning genderdoe person... They can kindly fuck off. You're valid <3
And the whole idea that it's a nonbinary person's fault that something they like about themselves is gendered by society, so that means they can't have it and should feel dysphoria. That's whack af. It's different if you do end up feeling dysphoria because it's gendered, but if OP doesn't feel that way then that's awesome! I love it when another trans or nonbinary person doesn't have to feel dysphoria about themselves. Plus people gender everything, so who cares. I'm getting new glasses because strangers code me as my agab even though I don't think they look that gendered, and I'm actually really mad that I feel like I have to give something up that I like in order to be comfortable in public. So for everyone that doesn't have to experience that I'm glad.
I was similar until I also got that rush of dysphoria. But tbf I was thinking of getting rid of my facial hair anyway because I always shave and am probe to ingrowns.

I just started laser while my hair is still dark. I have a few grays though, I have to get get electrolysis for those.
Omg this reminds me, when I came out everyone kept asking when I was going to cut my hair short???? And I was like what do you mean tf like everyone has this fucked up little view of non binary people as these androgynous cis women I don’t get it
When I came out as NB, I started picking out more neutral clothing, I grew out and dyed my hair, but the beard was not going anywhere. The beard is part of my style whether I'm [REDACTED] or Axyl. A clean shave just doesn't work on my face.
I feel this. I don’t want to look like a man. I don’t want to look like a woman. I just want to look like an adult with no particular sexual features. The very idea of having more secondary sex characteristics makes me wanna cry.
THIS
But that's the crazy part is I do hate my body 🙃 and for some reason my choice to not shave makes everyone think I have 0 dysphoria and there for am not trans. But some trans people live without dysphoria and it's fucked up to be like ( no dysphoria no gender affirming)
Way to downplay dysphoria
Yeah and I totally understand the mistaking me for a man. It doesn't upset me and I let it be. What I don't stand for is invalidating an entire group of people like every person is exactly the same and has to be the same. That shit does not fly.
Saved this comment in my special time vault 🥰
It's always been like this for me 🥲 I was scared of coming out as trans because of people like this 😪 I'm not scared of them anymore though 😅 they are just babies
r/transmedical is full of people with similar beliefs. “GNC/non binary people/trans people with no dysphoria make the community look bad” bruh
Based on my experience those types tend to be in two camps: 

To be trans is to suffer, if you dont suffer you are ""valor stealing"" (this can be seen in ADHD, autism, etc. As well. You can get high support requirement folk in those communities try to push out the low because they are just ""trenders"") this probably stems from envy of trans folk who get just the euphoria and little dysphoria. 

Quality control the trans: the deluded idea that bigots will change their mind and accept trans people if they oust all the ""low quality"" (ie: trans folk bigots rail against the most) seen in the ""neopronouns hurt trans people"" and ""you have to be binary trans and hyper fem/masc to be valid trans."" (This is because that type of trans person is the ""least confusing"" to bigots. A trans woman tomboy breaks their brains for example) LGB drop the T operates on the same mindset.
Yeah 😅 alot of the reason I have it is to support all the groups of people that have facial hair and don't like it. 

I used to do a LOT of postmates orders and there were more then a few bearded ladies and bearded trans mascs and bearded trans female that all seem too scared to go out in public so they order food. So I go out in public as I am to show that there are groups of people like me, they are just scared of society 😔 and I mean I am too. But I think what I'm doing serves a good purpose
This person definitely adheres to the binary.
Definitely 😍 they should try being happy some time 😂
🥰 it's okay I feel like I handled it fine
Essentially 🥲 I feel sorry for them but also they can fuck off
Yup yup yup 🥲
I feel a little dumb for asking but what does truscum mean. I kinda know what truscum is all about but my mind reads it as True Scum and I can't image they named themselfs that.
One of their users said “it’s transphobic to not date trans people because they’re trans” then straight up said “I don’t want to date other trans people because they’re trans”. Baffling.
[removed]
Ty so much brain slug 🥰
Fuck yeah friend 🥰 take my follow
My main dysphoria is my voice too. 🤮 but I also think I have a pretty good voice just not the one I want. So i try to record myself singing because it reminds me that I do sound good to some people 😌 just not the voice I want

I also hate having to tuck golf equipment everyday 3 times a day 😑 I'd really like to not have to do that anymore. Or at least simplify it some 😉
I agree it's real ridiculous
Ya spelt “loath” wrong
I love this 🥰 thank you for sharing it with me
It's been happening since I was 11 😅 I'm used to it.but your right it shouldn't happen, I hope my posts create a safe space to discuss that stuff 😀
Yeah I'm terrified of that. I don't like my beard. And it gives me dysphoria. But I'm afraid that I've gotten used to it and if I shave because other people told me too then I'll regret it because it wasn't MY decision, I just got tired of the hate 😪 

So ima wait till I know I'm ready myself.
I’ve been spending so much time trying to figure out ways I could pass, to the point where I was almost convinced that I really wanted to get top surgery and begin hormone therapy. I just now realise how the whole “goal” of passing made me miserable and brought me into hating my body even more because I knew I would never look like the average skinny androgynous looking nonbinary individual described by media :’)  I also hate the idea some people have that in order to be trans you MUST go through a physical transition too, there are so many reasons why I do not wish to change my body through medical procedures and it goes way beyond not wanting to or having the financial stability for it.
😂🤣😂🤣 omg I love this
I've never worried about passing exept in 1 instance. Public restrooms. I REFUSE to go into the men's bathroom. Infact the last time I tried was 3 weeks ago and I cried.

 I had to go to the bathroom really really bad and me my partner and feys whole family were there to watch here younger sister do a cheer squad think for a football game. So you know, there were lots of kids and parents there. Now I had my titties not at all hidden because I refuse to do that and there were several parents that would stare and 1 basically followed me to the bathroom even when I wasn't going I just happened to be nearby. 

So I was NOT going to get assaulted that day and decided even if my partner took me into the bathroom 🙃 girls bathroom was off limits right now. So I was going to attempt going into a men's bathroom for the first time In like 6 months. THAT SHIT WAS DISGUSTING. there was urine allll over the urinal area, the handle, the wall, the floor had like a 3 foot puddle. I looked in stall 1 of 3 and it had a mountain of doo doo that went higher then the seat so sitting down was literally impossible. Stall 2 had what looked like 5 different left shoes 🤔 and I was like what kind of weird pact is taking off your left shoes and flushing them together. And in stall 3 it was actively overflowing because it was cloged. There was a nice slow stream out of the toilet down the side across the floor and into the drain that wasn't clearing any of the urinal urine. I cried a little cuz I had to go real bad and I just stared at the mess for like 60 seconds with some tears streaming down my face because I was too scared to go in the girls. I actually was even looking at the sinks thinking 🤔 well maybe possibly could use it as a urinal which I've never had to do before, but even that was covered in pee. Someone already had done that and left it a mess, and I realized I would never do that anyway 🙃 I was just desperately thinking about it. 

So after about 2 minutes of a mental break down I had to myself in the bathroom I decided I'd hold it 3 more hours till I got home and if I went in my pants by accident it would be damn worth it to not get the police called on me for ""being in the wrong bathroom"" 

 The best part about this whole thing though was when I came up the bathroom crying a little bit. I overheard 3 of the girls that were hanging out in front of the bathrooms talking about me. One of them was saying that I went into the wrong bathroom probably because I was uncomfortable going into the girl's bathroom here. And one of the other ones was saying that I was a guy. They pointed out the flowers that I had on my clothes close and my boobs and said they think I'm trans and that I just went into the wrong bathroom right now. 😭 that made me cry a lot, I didn't say anything to these girls and they were defending me and explaining things I am too scared to bring up. I fucking love kids 😭 God damn 

(Ps. Made myself cry again 😅)
Thank you for the rant 🥰 I completely agree, that's why I'm glad I consistently make posts and give people like you a place to rant about this stuff 🥰
Yup 😅  sure is fuckin weird
Lol 😂 are you pretending to be my mom? Cuz it's spot on
Yeah they were literally commenting on a post about gender expression not equaling gender identity 🙄
Lol but I do feel dysphoria from the beard. I keep it for bigger reasons then my dysphoria though
Jesus 🥲 that's so fucked up 

""They didn't decide fast enough so they don't get to decide"" like who the fuck do you think you are to decide for someone else like that 🤔
Haha jokes on you I don't like mine either😂
Lol I love these moments 😅 ""I hate that person, but not because they're trans""
Also this happened to me a few times over 😅 but I realized that pride was about being prideful in yourself and that changed my perspective on everything.
Ty Kirby 🥰 I kinda do too even though I don't like having it 🤣😅
Yup I have mine in support of them. But also trans males with no top surgery who are on testosterone and trans females who are too scared to shave are very large groups too 🥰
And that's the way it should be
It gets better Maria 🥰 when you no longer HAVE to talk to them they will start to worry more because they are going to lose you. It's the best feeling ever to finally not care about your moms opinion or having to contact her
They are an asshole but outing them isn't super nice 😅
Yup… I’m on the fence about changing my voice. I kinda like my voice.
I used to compare the way that I felt to that of being a lego or a Barbie😅 you know how they are just perfectly flat
I want people to look at my gender like you would a pretty rock.
Do people not understand that people have dysphoria about different things? 

I've had people say similar thing about my appearance ""well if you cut your hair then I'll believe your trans!"" cis men have long hair too, I don't really have dysphoria around my hair. My boobs though? Yeah hate those. Voice? Would like to change. Of course I get gendered as a woman because of my hair, but I got gendered as a woman with my hair cut short. I'll probably always get gendered as a woman because I'm 5 feet tall.
Love when people just project their assumptions on what others deal with internally based on seeing a very very small snippet of someone's life 🥴
It's not down playing it. But to be honest somebody else's dysphoria is not my problem. Some people get dysphoria, and I feel bad for them. I get dysphoria,  Sometimes people feel bad for me. But nobody gets to make that someone else's problem. 

Your dysphoria is your own to deal with and if you're having a hard time with it then you need a therapist.
They didn't tho?
Way to downplay this ratio 😼
No absolutely, I totally agree with that. Just because people are in the same group of people doesn't mean they have the same experiences.
Seriously, I understand mistaking me for a woman too, because it takes much more effort for me to fully come across to strangers as a man when I am one, than to just wear less fitted clothes and forgive people who assume I’m just butch or something. Plus I love my rockstar hair and don’t currently want to give it up even with the damage. I often get shy around people, especially androgynous people because I admire them but also have no way of guessing without asking for pronouns, which is really frowned on by people who aren’t LGBT in my area.
Fr. Anybody who spends their time trying to invalidate the happiness of others shouldn’t be taken seriously
What?
Just gotta send em love, loving and healing energy, and leave em be 💗🙏
to my understanding, they were originally called that by non-transphobic trans ppl as a shorthand for “true transsexual scum”, but truscum seem to have reappropriated the label in their proudness of being exclusionary “scum”. kind of that self-virtuous “i’ll stand by my beliefs even if i’m hated, cause they’re right and i don’t cave to wokeness!” attitude
Make it make sense 😐
Not cool outing them. This is harassment.
yeesh, i hate the abusive way the OG commenter treated OP as much as anyone else, but really? literally all you’ve ever commented is all related to the person you linked, idk if you’re a sock puppet of the OG or just obsessive, but either way that really don’t seem healthy
You called? Oh got sick of dming me telling me to kill myself?
My ex helped me so much with this. He stated that ""being trans isn't about dysphoria as much as it's about euphoria."" To clarify this isn't to wipe away the idea that dysphoria isn't prevalent in the trans community, but that it's isn't a 'gatekeeper' to being trans.
😂🤣😂🤣
Thank you for reading!! 😋
and that’s so lame that you’ve had to just get used to it 🙃 but you definitely are creating that welcoming space so thank you 🥹
Damn, and even after reading a post about it they missed the point.
Oh... well

Them: ''YOU CAN'T BE A FEMALE IF YOU DON'T SHAVE YOUR BEARD!!!1!!1!''

Cis women with beards who don't shave theirs: hhmmm

there, fixed
Honestly? A bitch. She kinda ruined our relationship after she, and my aunt, believed a known liar that I talked shit about her behind her back. So this was more than enough of a good reason for me to drop her.
Lmao I mean like I'm a trans guy and I'm dating a trans woman. I hate her and she was the worst person I've ever met for a fuckload of other reasons but as I said, she's a bad person AND she's trans, she's not a bad person BECAUSE she's trans
Awh I totally get that, potentially you feel like how I feel with my curvy chest I just see it as a part of my body like my elbow but because I know the rest of the world has a very cut out perception of curvy chest = woman even tho I don't see it like that I know for a fact other people will and therefore I have a hard time when I'm not wearing my binder 😅 idk I think your awesome and I send positive Energy ✨
Yeah! And some of them absolutely despise it while others don’t care. Because if it doesn’t make you feel dysphoric then you most likely just accept it as part of your body/part of yourself. Which is awesome 🤷🏻‍♀️
Same. I always thought mine was on the more neutral side until everyone started clocking me when I answered the work phones 🙃
I was for a while too, but I'm menopausal so I can get it done with a pretty lose dose of T. Figured why not give it a go and I can always stop when I'm ready to. Just met with my hormone doc yesterday. In two weeks we meet up again and begin treatment
I've recently only wanted to slightly change my voice. I love its register and warmth but wish it was a bit more feminine.
Same. Like I like my voice for the most part, it's on the moderate to lower side of feminine and can sound neutral at times but I wish it could be deeper sometimes.

Edit: spelling and grammar
Yeah they will always find a reason to invalidate you. Just remember they don't mean shit to you.
Like seriously, my dysphoria over my chest is highly variable in both directions, while my voice dysphoria is only ever more or less “bad.” Otherwise this is an okay body and I’m just struggling with accepting I have massive scars now.
The hair thing is so annoying. I know tons of cis men with long hair and cis women with short hair. It’s arbitrary af
Having long hair makes me feel MORE masc and that's why I'm growing it out.
instant win
KO!
Definitely true. I've spent a LONG time meeting a lot of colorful people and there are a lot of different mindsets out there for things I never once thought of. I think it's the coolest thing but other people call me dumb for not understanding thought processes that most normal people get 🤔
Yup 😅  I don't
From the post: ""having facial hair makes you a man only."" That you can't be any kind of trans if you still exibit characteristics of your assigned sex, even if those characteristics aren't *exclusive* to your assign sex. That humans can only be 1 of 2 things.
Yep 😅 sometimes I can do that
Nice 😂  thank you for the lesson 🥰
Thank you for explaining

I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Lol yup 😂🤣
Aweee I'm sorry 😞
I mean I think it's a little different 😅 just because I do actually not like my beard 😅 there are a long list of reasons I keep it. But being comfortable with keeping it is not me right now 🤪  But it doesn't hurt me physically and and it's not the worst dysphoria I've ever felt
Lol that's the thing that's weird about my situation though 😅 I do get dysphoria from my beard and I hate it. But I think I want to not get dysphoria from it before I shave, or maybe I'm making a point, or maybe I'll like the beard one day. 

I just feel like I hate the beard and I can't tell if it's because I actually don't like it or everyone tells me I'm fucked up for keeping it. So until I'm sure I'm shaving for me then ima keep it to support people 🥰
I want my voice to be a bit more deeper so people won't mistake me as female. Because I just don't want to be seen as a female. I want to be seen more as a msc Nb.
No but it really is quite cool. It's not like we're all just one big hivemind haha. Everyone has their own views and experiences, it's what makes a person who they are...
Hehehe of course just reminding you to rethink ya reactions! 💗💗💗 much love
I agree they don’t deserve our kindness. This doesn’t mean they deserve *unkindness* though. And if you can’t see how telling someone to kill themselves and sharing their details online is wrong then you need to take a serious look at yourself.
Be better then them mate 😅
learn to control that bud. not gonna get far by telling ppl to kill themselves when you're mad
I mean I don't like my chest either I just look at in a natural kinda way
Hmmm ok but a beard grows back so you could try to shave it off to see how you feel, don’t force yourself into discomfort just because of others. You need to consider how you feel first :) 

I mean. I’d suggest trying it out, it doesn’t cost anything and it’s a personal choice. Choosing to yourself not have a beard doesn’t mean you don’t support trans women who keep theirs :)
But that’s just my opinion haha you do you!!
Oh lol 😆 I try to be positive and helpful 🥰

This person was aspecially stupid though 🙄 and caught me on 4th day of no sleep. Not an excuse because I don't care about what that person thinks but I was way to tired to be polite about his idiocy.
I agree 😬 harrasing them was not the purpose of my post
Yeah I'm attempting that with my face 🙃 it's going... well? Kinda. Except for the death threats.
Well the thing is since I have been on estrogen my beard hair has been changing and I'm kind of worried that if I shave it it'll never grow in this full again so I feel like it might be my last opportunity to try having a beard
Understandable!
Hmmm. Yeah I getcha. Maybe ask around other people on E to see how it changed their facial hair? Maybe it’s just gonna be a bit thinner and paler but you could still grow a beard? Just to assess all of your options properly
I do 🥰 there's a couple other people I know of that have similar situations 😅"	ws5vhn	NonBinary	804	0.97	2022-08-19 05:43:53
Yesterday was so beautiful it temporarily cured my dysphoria		"Outside looks beautiful too ;) I love the safety pin too. I hope the dysphoria gets easier
Yeah! Good weather always helps with my dysphoria. Is that No Face on your shirt? <3

Despite some dysphoria this morning I’ve been kind to myself and I’m feeling good about the day 🥰		"That shirt is amazing! Where did u get it?
I’m happy that you’re feeling good about the day, you should! This is a really good photo of you, it has big enby energy
Glad you’re starting off well :) Try to remember your strengths are way greater than your weaknesses ❤️
this post helped me in a tough moment. you look awesome ❤️
Everything about this is perfect.
The eyebrow slit, the beanie, the shirt. Just....everything. 
Have a nice day!
It is ok to have some dysphoria now and then. You are valid even if you feel you aren't. Dysphoria is still dysphoria even if it only takes over part of a day, and that's ok.
That is a killer shirt! 

Glad you were able to be kind to yourself today! Sometimes you need a little extra gentle-ness in your day, and if no one else will do it, you know what you need best anyway!
you look very nice!! I hope you have a great day!! much love to u!! <3
Looking amazing ❤️
You look amazing and I hope that your day and next week will stay good.
I love the shirt!!
Obsessed w your shirt 😍

"Anti-dysphoria mirror! Haven't been able to bind lately for health reasons so I decided to ""fix"" the bathroom mirror"		"My favourite gender neutral pronoun is comrade
I love that 😂 just hide the dysphoria from view :P
The Fluchtwege freihalten is a nice touch.
i thought this was a picture of BDG at first glance
Ha! Grüße aus Berlin, netter Spiegel :)
That's so clever! Great solution 👍🏽
The mirror and you are super adorable!
ooh, very nice
Hah quite clever . I don’t have a binder yet(got one shipped to my grandmaws but oops quarantine)
Might  have to Try this
Nazis taste like my brother
This is a whole mood; I used to have this big mirror in my bedroom that I covered with drawings and stuff so I wouldn't run the risk of accidentally catching a glimpse of my reflection.
nice!! you look good :) this is a good idea, might steal it. no need to put a towel over the mirror anymore lol
yeah take that mirror!
NOICEEE
That such a good idea! I'm in the same boat, bruised, maybe cracked, ribs. Can't even wear a sports bra
Nicer spiegel auf jeden fall :D
Why didn't you put the stickers at the top? Isn't it harder to see the reflection now?
Cool, I wanna have a mirror like that xd
Love it
oh my gosh! I love BDG. What a compliment <3
oh my, thank you \^\_\^
I have a lot of questions
That's the point: to not see the chest area in the mirror.
Awe its true
That is so true, I didn't think about that. Perfect placement then 👏👏 I love it"	g1vjk6	NonBinary	741	0.99	2020-04-15 16:41:14

Your bitch is out here fighting dysphoria with their baggy button down (19/AMAB)		"You look great! Your smile makes me happy.
You look great!
Sorry, but if you don’t mind me asking, what does AMAB stand for? I’m trying to learn all the lingo for my enby partner
Killing it mate! Baggy clothes are the way to go, especially hoodies if able!!
Idk if this will help but you look rly fucking cute and also rly fucking gender neutral
Sorry, but if you don’t mind me asking, what does AMAB stand for? I’m trying to learn all the lingo for my enby partner
Omg I wore that shirt today too!
Absolutely love your hair 🤩
Your hair is great!! And flannels are universally flattering
You look so cute! I have a shirt just like that
Assigned male at birth
It's no problem at all, AMAB stands for asigned male at birth. I think it's really sweet you're trying for your parter, I get that a lot of it is quite confusing.

Came out to my therapist, I don't know if I wanna see her again	"TW: Transphobia, dysphoria

(TL;DR at end)

I recently started accepting myself as non-binary, Agender specifically, after working through internalised transphobia and enby-phobia (I guess?). And about a week ago my mum asked me if I was trans because she had been suspecting that something was up. I would've come out to her sooner, but she had previously shown openly transphobic behaviour, but it turns out she's changed and is very accepting and supportive (although she doesn't really understand what non-binary is). 

Now, I've been struggling with bad social dysphoria which (among other things) has been getting in the way of confidently going out in public and finding a job, so I thought it would help to speak to my therapist about it so we could work through it. So in my most recent session, I told her that I hated that people perceived me as a woman and how uncomfortable it makes me. So she asked,

""Why don't you want to be a girl?""

I said ""I don't like it, it feels wrong""

then she asked ""do you want to be a boy?""

I answered ""no""

She asked, ""why do you want to cancel yourself?""

I just sat there, confused. So I asked what she meant.

And she said, ""Why do you want to take away a part of yourself?""

And I was like 'what the hell is she talking about? I just told her I'm not a girl or boy, there's nothing *to* take away.'

She just did not understand at all. At first I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought, 'oh, she just doesn't understand what non-binary means, but I suppose she could learn,' 

But she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing. 

I tried to explain that being feminine and being perceived as a woman is very uncomfortable and just feels wrong, and I essentially told her that I wanted top surgery (which she referred to as a double mastectomy) and to appear gender neutral. 

And so you know what she asked in response? She asked if I had any s3xual trauma. I don't, but like, how is that even relevant? 

She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

To which she would respond, ""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living."" and ""I know what it's like to think like a boy, I grew up surrounded by them. I don't even own a dress. My b00bs are uncomfortable too, the first thing I do when I get home is take off my bra. I don't like hanging out with other women, all they do is gossip and \[other stereotypes\]."" And then she did the ""when they dig up your skeleton they'll see a woman's skeleton"" thing and other ridiculous arguments.

But she understands that you can't change your thoughts/mind, y'know? She kept saying that ""you can change how you look as much as you want, but that won't change your thoughts."" 

And I thought 'EXACTLY ?? I want to change my body to fit my thoughts/mind'. 

She continued, ""you'll only ever have feminine thoughts""

To which I said, ""I've never had feminine thoughts.""

Her response: ""No, you've always had feminine thoughts. Let's simplify it all the way down. Do you sit down to pee?""

I was like, ""?? Of course I do?? It's easier than standing up, why would I do it any other way? That's not even a 'feminine thought', it's a practicality thing.""

And she started questioning how I would transition to be gender neutral by pointing out all the things I'm dysphoric about, and saying ""double mastectomy is very hard to get and its very expensive. How are you planning to pay for it? I know your family can't afford it. How are you going to change your voice? Or your bone structure?"" She was acting like I had brought this all up on a whim and not like I hadn't been thinking thoroughly about it for at least the past 2 years. 

I stopped listening to half the things she was saying coz I was so mad/frustrated at her ignorance. And after a while I just stopped saying anything because I was not in the mood to argue about it, especially because I'm terrible at arguing. It probably made her think she was 'winning' the argument.

Then, and I don't know why she felt the need to do this, she told me about her friend's son, who is a trans man. She showed me a picture of him and was saying how he got top surgery, bottom surgery, and probably also hrt (I can't remember), all the while misgendering and dead-naming him. She was like, 'this is my friend's *daughter*, \[dead name\], *she* goes by \[chosen name\]. *She* had this surgery, and that surgery. *She's* not really a woman, but *she's* not a man, and this is a picture of *her* when *she* was a little *girl*."" \*shows picture that is literally a young boy\*

She says that no matter what I say, her opinion of me won't change, and that I'm free to identify how I want to. But from what I experienced, she won't fully respect my identity and will always see me as a girl, which is exactly what I was afraid of. She managed to trigger my dysphoria, anxiety, and depression all in one go. She just wants the best for me, she's nice, but I don't know if I'll be comfortable going to her again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I came out to my therapist about being Agender, and she didn't understand at all and was very transphobic about it in the typical transphobe way, and I left feeling worse than when I went in."	"Yeah hell no. I'm nonbinary, and a mental health therapist. Too many points to note which were inappropriate, so to summarize: all of what they said was shit. That's not therapy. It may take some searching but competent therapists are out there. Hang in there pal.
I’d send her a message telling her she needs to do research if she is going to be working with trans clients. Let her know why you left before you leave. But definitely leave. Therapists are supposed to be your support not your bully
Trust your gut, OP. ABSOLUTELY find a new therapist, and I’d even report her to her college because it’s pretty unethical what she did. Not just gross, but she straight up put you in danger by doing what she did. 

You know yourself, be true to you ❤️
Yeah, report them and never go back. That's just a basic lack of professionalism.
Good god that sounds horrible. I hated reading that, really sorry. This person should definitely not be practicing for trans or probably any queer people. Or maybe just any people.
Is there any way you can report this woman? What she said to you is absolutely disgusting and could have had disastrous consequences for someone who was in the wrong headspace. I’m so sorry you went through that, she is wrong (as I’m sure you know from having more than one functional brain cell).
Oh my god, i got frustrated just READING that. Jesus fucking Christ. Ignorance is not an excuse to talk to someone that way! As someone who is going into this field, this was handled so poorly by her. It's one thing to simply be uneducated about trans identities, but she doesn't even care to learn. 

Im so sorry you had this experience with someone who is supposed to be an educated professional. I encourage you to seek a new therapist <333
>""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living.""

What even is that? 

That sounds like a lecture from your parents about job prospects, not the kind of thing a therapist should ever be saying about any form of self care! ""How is making yourself happy and taking care of your mental health going to put food on the table?""  What the fuck.  You can't put food on the table if you're too depressed and dysphoric to work.

She sounds like you just said your dream is to be a dog psychic, not that you're talking about your mental and physical wellbeing. 

If you can OP, I would see if you can find a queer or at least queer and trans friendly therapist. My therapist is genderqueer and it's revolutionary never to have to explain my identity to them.
Holy shit, I would've walked out as soon as she did this

>she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing.

This therapist should not be seeing people. She is extremely ignorant and transphobic as hell. I'm so sorry you went through this
people who say and believe shit like this shouldn't be allowed to therapists, there literal job is to talk you through your problems and help you achieve mental stability, not to trigger every fucking alarm in you, constantly mistreat you and be extremely offensive to patients

you are agender and valid, and no one but you can take that away from you. Your therapist doesn't want the best for you, if she did, she wouldn't deny your thoughts and call you crazy for not conforming the society's extremely bullshit gender norms/ideas
So thay sounds like she was mega projecting onto you (she clearly has *issues* around her own gender, at least others of her gender) and yes absolutely do not go back to her.
Fuck that therapist I’m so sorry your are going through this. I would definitely never see her again.
Even without the awful transphobia it sounds like your therapist is very unprofessional, they shouldn’t have shown photos of someone else. I hope you can find the therapist you need. :)
This is the worst of these experiences I have ever heard. Holy fuck. Yeet this therapist into orbit and report the shit out of her!
That's not even on the same post code of what a therapist should say.

Ithat's what my idiot mom said when I came out.

Run!

(And leave without paying if you can, they don't deserve a cent.)
okay that last part about the friend's son is def some sort of violation of confidentiality. get out now.
What a disgusting person. Bigots like that shouldn't even have a license to practise.
You need to find a new therapist. 
Your therapist works for you. 
You deserve one who will support you.
I specifically sought out a LGBTQ+ therapist (and that was before I was questioning, I just was seeking safety and ENBY is now a topic I explore with her). If you can, I recommend doing the same if you can. Therapy is such a vulnerable activity and what you shared here is worth reevaluating that relationship imho.
So she's openly phobic towards you, projects her own experiences/feelings onto you, tries to guilt trip you into not seeking treatment...she should not be allowed to practice therapy.
Haha report that therapist
“If they dig up your skeleton they’ll see a woman’s skeleton” bitch if they dig up your skeleton you could be misidentified as a man, skeletons are not that fucking easy to sex.
What a nightmare!! Everything she said is wrong, cruel, biased, and foolish. This woman is deranged and uneducated, do not go back
I only read most of that but the part where the therapist said the thing about there are 2 sexes you have to pick pick one and....omfg..when they dig up your skeleton!??!?!

This woman is not your therapist. She has big terf energy.

This brings me back to coming out as NB to a cis female close friend and her laughing it off like bro you are huge just be a bro, bro.

 Finding a good therapist even when you are cis is a process it's like going on a bunch of dates until you find the person you have compatibility with.

 Sending you NB love and pride.
It's frustrating to hear how much a fellow therapist failed you and failed to uphold the professional ethical standards we are supposed to follow. Clearly this therapist is not competent in managing trans and gender diverse concerns. This therapist should probably get some training. It can be daunting to either bring up this conflict directly with your therapist or go through the process of finding a different one. Either way, you deserve a better counseling experience and I wish you luck however you decide to move forward.
Wow, I am so sorry that happened to you. Please take care of yourself! Even if she believed all of those horrible things, or didn’t know what you were talking about, as a therapist, her responsibility is to non judgmentally help you with what you are experiencing. And boy, did she fail at that. Ugh. So sorry. 😢
I’m so angry on your behalf!! Cancel yourself?? Seriously??? Sounds like she watches Fox News. 

If anyone ever starts talking to you like that again, you are allowed to stand up and say, “This session is over,” and walk the fuck out. Slam the door on the way out if you like.
Report that shit. Whatever their professional organization is send a passed off letter.
Fuck this. As far as the sexual trauma thing goes, it is relevant. Some detrans people- women specifically- transition to become male or transmasc as a response to sexual trauma. They see their gender (woman, usually) as being why they were targeted (and that’s often at least partially true) so they begin to hate their woman-ness for getting them hurt, even though, you know, the only person responsible is their attacker/rapist. Other times, it’s a cognitive thing; they were attacked as a woman in a woman’s body, so they mentally dissociate from their body as a way of separating themselves from the trauma. Sort of like someone changing their name to escape bad things they did/had done to them in the past. It’s complex, but her comments beyond asking if you had sexual trauma were entirely irrelevant and she is not paid to tell you that what you feel is or isn’t real- it is, purely because you feel it.
Your therapist sucks. She sounds like a fundamentalist religious counselor type. Don’t listen to any of what she spouts. She’s not nice and she doesn’t have a clue what the best for you is. You deserve so much more.
This this is the reason why we need more Queer Affirmative therapist
Get a new therapist.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
yeah fuck that therapist. she is literally doing the opposite of her job
Please leave that practice and fill out every negative review possible/you're comfortable doing.
I'd report her
Dump her. But also, she is being abusive. Not sure if she is private or with your provider's office...either way figure out a way to complain, report, or make your voice heard. And leave a bad review if possible.
That was horrible. Unprofessional. And disgusting behaviour. You should never have to feel that disrespected in a setting that is supposed to be a safe space to talk about anything on your mind. Not okay at all. Report that, exactly what you wrote and how it made you feel, and find someone new. I know how hard it is to get a new therapist and start over. But that would be better than someone who doesn’t respect who you are. That won’t help you at all, it’ll just hurt you. And at that point. Why pay the money to be lectured at about how you don’t know who you are? I’m so sorry you had to go through that OP. No one should be made to feel like they have to shut down and ignore a therapist in your own therapy session.
Not only does she sound like a bad person, she's a terrible therapist! Take it from someone with a whole ass psychology degree, you're never supposed to let your personal beliefs influence how you treat your clients/patients. I'm also Dailey certain she broke several codes of conduct by showing you photos and discussing the personal details of her friends son. 

Absolutely find a new therapist! There are so many good queer friendly ones out there who will understand help you! 

Best of luck ❤️
Unbelievably cringe therapist, fuck that. I’m sorry you had to deal w that
New therapist and COMPLAIN about that one. She shouldn’t be practicing
Holy shit. Excuse my language but that lady is out of her ever lasting mind! Don't go back to see her, you can get a therapist else where who isn't homo/transphobic, respectful and, supportive of you and your goals. I'm so sorry that happened. Hopefully you find a better therapist that is a decent human being. There are apps that offer therapy from therapists so that's an option. Sadly, I have never seen a free therapist but you could see if they have financial aid or if your insurance covers it, that's me assuming you're in the USA or Canada, I admit I know nothing about how other places do it, but I digress.
Naw.

I had a non-binary therapist, and they were absolutely amazing.

I had gone to them for a few different things, but when I mentioned going on HRT hopefully sooner rather than later they were super accepting and after hearing me ramble about how I knew what changes there would be, that I wouldn’t necessarily adore some but also wouldn’t really have a PROBLEM with them, that I knew the risks, blah blah blah, they had nothing much to say other than support.

Wish I coulda kept seein them but insurance changed, and now I ain’t got any at the moment, but I’d like to think they’d be real happy for me with how far I’ve come in only about a year.

Your therapist tho? 

If you’re able to, I’d definitely consider finding a new one.
Holy shit I am SO sorry this happened! That therapist shouldn't even be licensed. I'm a therapist and I'm agender and even if I wasn't and didn't understand, our role is to support the client, seek to support them in gaining insight, and work toward *their* goals, never to be condescending, transphobic, and violent like this. Definitely support you doing what you need and want for YOU and you have every right to file complaints with the practice and licensing board if you want to. Sending you lots of care and encouragement ❤️
You are paying them . You can get up and leave. Fuck this lady and never go back. There ARE gender understanding therapist out there.
Yeah so... You should report her, in my opinion.  I'm nonbinary and also work in mental health and if anyone at my work said this bullshit they would get fired SO fast.  Like, my coworkers don't always get it and sometimes they say ignorant shit because they don't understand, but it is literally company policy that we have to use people's preferred names and pronouns and the agency as a whole is in support of LGBTQ+ rights even though I work in an area of the country that is transphobic AF.  If she's a solo practitioner then idk if anything will be done, but if she works under any kind of agency she would likely get fired, which tbh she deserves.  Even beyond her shitty opinions, if she talked to someone like that even if she was in the right, she would STILL be behaving extremely unprofessionally.  No therapist should ever be that condescending and outright dismissive of a patient, regardless of context.
She doesn’t want the best for you if she intentionally triggered you like that my fellow NB friend. Even if they didn’t understand a good therapist wouldn’t have gone out of their way to do that to you.
I have an amazing she/they therapist, you need to find a new one. You deserve so much better!
Please please please find someone competent. This is absolutely unacceptable. 

I see that you're a bit hesitant to find someone new but please do! This is really, truly not acceptable. This person is harmful. You should not continue seeing them.
Therapist: time to shop for a new one.

Your mom: her attitude was crap but she had questions. It sounds like she might be open to learning. And if she truly does love you no matter what, she will be. Share some resources about gender theory with her so she can begin to understand how gender is fluid and a construct. 

Love and light to you, I'm sorry coming out has started this way for you.
Nope nope nope please never see them again
I hope you report them and are able to find someone new. You deserve better!
My significant other (a man) pees sitting down. Does that make him a woman??

Yay on your mom not being gross!!

Find a new therapist.
I had my 80 year old therapist say that my being nonbinary was a defense mechanism / excuse. The next appointment was our last, and she seemed surprised. But I found an LGBTQ+ friendly therapist that I moved on to. It's much better having a therapist who believes you. Move on from your transphobic therapist. ❤️
I told my psychiatrist and psychologist that I'm genderfluid leaning towards feminine and they immediately asked which pronouns I'd like them to use. You need a new therapist.

I'm sorry you went through that. I've had a few weird comments from my respective therapists but when I've asked them to explain what they meant it was perfectly reasonable. I hope you get it sorted out!
Jesus fucking Christ, never go back there. Consider reporting this (her) to the licensing board as this sounds like conversion therapy and is not how you conduct a therapy session in any way shape or form (I’m a therapist). You deserve better. Please do not go back to this monster.
disgusting, please don't come back
I noped out of the paragrah after the pee note, pease change therapist. She is just transphobic and inappropriate.
“Feminine thoughts”? What is this woman saying at this point ☠️☠️☠️ I’m sorry please get a better therapist if you can and report her for transphobia if the institution has the rights for
This therapist sounds like she's chosen the wrong career. I'd find someone else.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
This is so gross. You're not crazy OP. Do not trust this person with your well-being
I’ve always been nervous to come out to a therapist or just a doctor in general but I’ve done so reluctantly and every professional has been super accommodating and respectful. I hope you find a therapist who actually does their job and doesn’t let bias and their own ignorance dictate their practice!
I’m so sorry for the horrendous treatment by someone who should know better. I don’t know where you are but I hope you can find someone that can provide the affirming care you need and deserve.
As a non-binary therapist in training and also a client in therapy with a therapist who fully supports my being non-binary, you deserve *so* much better from your therapist. You deserve a safe space to be yourself and to be heard. But what she was saying here was so full of hate and misunderstanding. :(


I hope that she's been good for you in other areas, but this therapist clearly has a *lot* of transphobia that she is completely unashamedly projecting onto you. She needs to take a step back from her work and work out why she has an issue with trans and non-binary people and not see any clients in these groups until she's done some very serious personal work!!!

I hope you're doing okay, you are who you know you are and your identity is real and valid!! <3
Thank you for the trigger warnings♡
Highly unprofessional, please OP don't go back to her. And obviously don't believe one thing she has said, it's 100% bullshit.

She also should be reported for outing her friend's son. WTF is that? Showing his picture, outing him and dead naming him to a patient? She crossed several lines there.
LEAVE!!!
omg this isn't just don't see her again, this is don't see her and file a grievance with her site director or supervisor. the way she's asking about how you use the bathroom screams ""what genitals do you have"" and in a therapeutic relationship that question is incredibly inappropriate and borderline sexual harassment. a therapist has power over their client and they need to recognize that and attempt to level the playing field. deciding how you feel for you? that's disgusting. what's the point of you even going to these sessions if she's just gonna write your story for you? I'm so sorry op, it's so hard to be trans and be respected in healthcare. I wish you the best in finding a new therapist ❤️
I'm stuck with medi-cal and can't get any therapist other than either a) terrible untrained fools or b) mean old boomers
she was really inappropriate to you, i’m sorry to hear it
Holy shit.  I’m so sorry. Please don’t go back to her, she’s not a safe person.
>She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

>So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

This!!!!!!!! It feels great!
*n*^(th) comment saying you need to find a different therapist and drop that one double quick.
fire her! that is unacceptable. I've had my therapist question why I refer to myself as she/her occasionally when talking about times when I was identifying as a girl. I was like, well in my mind, during those years I was presenting/identifying as a girl, so that's the frame of reference I have for myself in those years. I feel like I was trapped in that identity for so long because of family and partner expectations, so it feels like my divorce and resulting self-discovery was a whole new chapter in my life and I'm not the same person I was.
Time to find a new therapist. It's okay to fire this one right away because she can and will cause you damage. What she's doing is abusive.
I don’t have anything to add other people didn’t already say. I’m just really sorry this happened to you. Obviously the way you were treated was wrong. You deserve so much better. There are other therapists out there that can support, validate, and help you. 

This one just turned out to be a real stinker.
Report her
Everything she said was pretty much a summed up list of transphobic talking points. Like point for point.
This person does NOT have your best interests at heart. She’s completely nuts. Better no therapist at all then having to deal with that horseshit.
Just wanna say the whole ""when they dig up your skeleton it will still be a woman's skeleton"" argument is bollocks anyway. I don't remember the specific details but I saw a tiktok saying skeletons are actually gender neutral and they can't tell the difference. Despite what people think
What the actual hell?

This person sounds about as unprofessional as you can get. I am appalled that people like this advertise themselves as therapists, should be fucking illegal or something- jesus.
Everyday more genuinely don't understand how people can trust therapists....
Please review this provider and mention that she is blatantly transphobic and pushes traditional gender roles, so other trans people know to keep away.

YIKES
what an awful therapist, fired immediately
She sounds awful
Using a ""Professional"" job to spout utter nonsense like that (Especially in a position where vulnerable people have to open up about their thoughts) should earn nothing more than a brick through a window.
Yikes. You’re going to need a second therapist because of the first one. That’s awful
She should have therapy, not you. Never go see her again, be you🥰 you got this!💪👏😘
That sucks. Therapists are people. People can be transphobes. And transphobes almost never change. You just didn't know, 'cause it hasn't come up until now. At least there is no doubt about it.

File an official complaint to the organisation she works for and any medical association they fall under (don't forget to mention she leaked personal info from another person in your session either, including their picture and misgendering them), give one star ratings on healthcare related websites, burn her on socials and NEVER come back.
I literally can’t believe my eyes. I’ve read a bunch of therapy horror stories but damn, this is on a whole other level. 

I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she’s just extremely uneducated, which is still unacceptable tho because all therapists should be able to work with trans patients. 

However, I think her approach was also quite rude, aggressive and unprofessional because she was clearly pushing her views onto you, which therapists aren’t supposed to do. When you come out, your therapist shouldn’t question, investigate or challenge your identity if you don’t ask them to; if they do, it literally turns into borderline conversion therapy. 

All of her inappropriate questions and remarks make her sound like a massive terf tbh, she’s clearly not the right person for you imo and even if “she could learn”, it’s not your job to educate her
Make sure you give her a bad review on whatever services she's with and tell people she's extremely transphobic so nobody else needs to deal with that.
She’s toxic as fuck. Extremely narrow minded. It’s dangerous.
You need to find a new therapist, specifically a gender affirming / LGBT sensitive one.
The digging up bones argument is so stupid bc it’s not like I’m gonna be alive to care that an archaeologist misgenders me. Like how could I even care how my bones get gendered when I’ve already been dead for hundreds of years?
I am so sorry! When I came out to my therapist the only thing we talked about was what name/pronouns I wanted to use and if she should note it in my file so the front desk knew too. 

What your therapist did is so horrifically out of line. I would not go back to see her. You don't owe her anything and if you don't feel comfortable telling her you don't want to see her anymore you can just ghost her. Her behavior was the antithesis of nice and it sounds like she's more worried with her comfort than what is best for you. 

Again, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.
Please report them too. They shouldn't be saying shit like that. It's detrimental and in no way in line with any ethical code for therapy standards. She needs more of education and to stfu with her personal opinions.
I'm so sorry this happened to you. Do not go back to this therapist. You deserve to have your identity respected. It's scary how many therapists are openly transphobic. You might want to check out r/therapyabuse
Im sorry this happened, hopefully you’re able to find a better therapist soon
use the website psychology today and you can find queer friendly therapists 💝
1) I’m so sorry. 2) why the fuck aren’t therapists required to understand gender dysphoria??? 3) fuck her. 4) find a new therapist.
so sorry you had to go through that. Your therapist is a transphobe, you deserve better
Yeah that's not right. I would have told her higher ups about how she treated you. It's always a bad sign when therapists invalidate their patients and try to win arguments with them. I hope you told her to stop misgendering you and that it was making you feel uncomfortable so she got the picture. That was really mean and insensitive of her. Oh and don't even get me started on the archologist stumbling across a ""male"" vs ""female"" skeleton cring bullshit. These people are so narrow-minded they can't seem to figure out the difference between the central nervous stem and the skeletal system.
Sounds like you may need a therapist to get over the trauma your therapist caused you. You should send her a bill and report her to the board for causing you trauma. That’s almost, if not actually, malpractice.
That's not a therapist. That's a transphobe
Fckkkkkkk this person. Leave and report them. That's not how a therapist should be AT ALL.
God.  My therapist was like this too.

I didn't fully tell him I was trans but I mentioned my gender feeling wrong often.  And I requested the use of my name ""Sunflower,"" which he seemed to respect at first.

But over time he started writing my dead name on my schedule cards and when I brought it up, he said:
""Are you running away from your past by changing your name?""

I said no, I just didn't like my old name because of the trauma and parents divorce drama surrounding it.  So I picked a new one that made me happy.  (And fit me as an Enby)

I wasn't trying to ""turn into someone else.""

Then he starts trying to convince me that Sunflower is weird and MIGHT work as a middle name.
But I should pick something normal.
Then he said: ""You look like your name is Patty.""
I straight up looked and dressed masc, and he'd made comments about my weight before (no offense to anyone with these names) so I knew him suggesting names like ""Patty, Bessy, Bettsy"" were also a jab at this.

I just grimaced and made up something about that being a character from Doug and tried to get back on track with the session.

So glad I never had another with him after that.

He did zero to make me feel like I could be vulnerable.  Especially about my gender.
I have several friends who have fired their therapists after a bad session. On top of that, most have requested to not pay for their final session, or requested to get their money back if they had already paid. Simply explain that instead of being helpful, your last session was extremely harmful and problematic, and that you either won't be paying for that session, or that you'd like your money back. 

Also, please report her to her governing body immediately. She requires a license to practice, which means she needs to uphold a certain code of ethics. Your provincial/state governing body should be aware of your session and they should investigate her. They can revoke her license if it's serious enough. Please report her so the next NB doesn't have to suffer through the same experience.

I'm so sorry you had to experience this.
If you can, definitely find a new therapist. If you feel comfy and want to, you can report her. If you want, you can also leave a review on Google/ZocDoc/whatever medical site she’s on—that way future potential nonbinary and trans clients will know to avoid her
I'm so sorry that this happened to you. I'm shocked, she really neess to get with the times otherwise she should get her license revoked. The last thing a therapist should do is make you feel triggered, absolutley find a new one.
Holy shit, I am so sorry that happened to you. Never speak to this awful woman again. She is straight up full of shit.
I probably wouldve told her to go fuck herself
Gosh, your uncertainty about the situation made me think the transphobia was going to be SUBTLE or something. Fuck going back, I don't think she even deserves to get paid for that session
what kind of an excuse for a therapist is that
I'm really sorry that this had to happen to you, i hope you are getting better
Non-binary therapist and supervisor here. You can report her to her licensing board for ethical violation and discrimination. Someone like that has no place in the mental health field. The American Counseling Association (leading association for therapists and counselors) and the American Psychiatric Association (leading association for psychologists) both recognize nonbinary identities as valid, and clearly state that failing to respect an individual's identity is discrimination and therefore in violation of the code of ethics. Link to the APA guidelines [https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf](https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf) 

You are amazing courageous to come out and it is infuriating that she did not treat the gift of knowledge that you gave her with the respect you deserve.
That therapist needs to stop practising.
That’s so so so inappropriate let alone discriminatory. I’d call it bullying.
It is not her place to “inform” you on you (especially when she is just trying to protect her narrow world view, not actually provide you with any accurate or helpful insight)- it is her job to work with you to understand yourself better (which means listening to YOUR input and respecting that) so that you can build a happier, healthier life. 
Yikes on a skateboard.
I am so sorry you have been so badly let down by a so called professional who should be there to help you.
Hi, I’m genderqueer and a therapist and I’m so sorry you experienced that! Not all therapists are competent. You owe this therapist nothing. Do whatever you want to take care of yourself. Ghost her, email her, scream at her… and hope you find yourself a therapist who can support you along your journey! ❤️
So sorry that this happened to you. It is great that you came out to your therapist, but terrible that she revealed herself to be an ignorant and blatant transphobe. This is a gift to you because you now know that you must find another therapist. Imagine if she was more subtle and messed with your mind for years? Good on her for being so blatantly obvious with her bigotry. So unprofessional.

Get. Another. Therapist. Now.
This sounds incredibly unprofessional to me. I don't want to jump to conclusions because I don't know the full context, but based on what you've described here I'd say she's a bad therapist. Not only is she not supposed to give you advice and tell you how to live, she's also not supposed to let her personal opinions and ignorance interfere with your therapy. If I were you I would quit immediately - it sounds like she is not interested in doing research to gain perspective and be more trans-literate. It would be incredibly hurtful and damaging for the client (you) in the long run, or even short-term.
Go to one more session... And record it. Keep that record and pass it on (in some places you may need her consent to record... In which case, you can force her to admit she doesn't REALLY believe what she's saying is legit).
In some places, this may be enough to get her in serious trouble. Damn.
Op what’s your region? If you live in cali specifically OC my therapist is nonbinary goes by she/they and they have tons of recourses on therapists who are super loving and helpful I also know another therapist cis woman who’s queer and although she herself isn’t trans she fully supports and hears everything lovely woman also does emdr therapy to help release trauma trapped in the body
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 If a therapist ever makes you feel like they aren't listening to you, they aren't doing their job right. Start looking for a new therapist.
All that u are saying fits my feelings so well. I get a major dysphoria when someone just assumes my gender. I have never felt like a girl nor a boy even before I was just putting on make up to fit in not cause I wanted to. I think the last time I put on make up was when I was 16. I am 25 now. Or wear certain clothes to fit in or act a certain way. Now I am like h*ll if I care what people think of me. (Does not help my dysphoria when someone adresses me as girl, woman, dauther, she or her tho). I have not come out to my parents or familly cause I don't feel the need to. I think deep down they will always see me like that. But I have come out to friends and they are all supportive. I have my pronouns in my bio's of my socials so probably familly who pay attention will see that I guess.
hell no. definitely stop seeing her, like don't even go to the next session. 

like the fact that she just went directly into ""attack mode"" instead of taking a nonjudgmental perspective of hearing you out, is just bad. 

when you get a new therapist they should def hear about this too. what your (hopefully former) therapist did was a total breach of trust. good therapy relies on trust. what she did was harmful.
Depending on what country you're in there are boards you can report her to. The only good that can come out of this is making sure she doesn't do it to anyone else.

I'm sorry you went through this and I hope it doesn't put you off from therapy altogether. I went through a series of therapists that just didn't fit at all until I landed with my current one who is queer herself/very knowledgeable of the queer community and I've been seeing her now for 8 years. I for sure recommend looking into therapists that specialize in LGBTQ+ care going forward. Best of luck
Hi friend, another enby therapist here. I agree with others that she should be reported to her college if you're up for it, not just because of her disgusting and completely unethical transphobia and homophobia but also because of the way she gave you private information about her friend's son. He isn't her client so technically she didn't break confidentiality but it's still completely unprofessional to talk about someone else's medical procedures and to show their photo without their consent. So gross. You deserve SO MUCH BETTER this woman needs to know that this behaviour is not only unprofessional but actively harmful.
I would start looking for a new therapist immediately and also let her know why you don't want to see her again. While I doubt this will make her reflect on her words and do some actual research, she should know that you felt hurt and offended
Spend some time searching for a therapist that specifically works with trans/NB people. I try to do this with any medical provider I will have an extended relationship with. I’ve just heard too many horror stories about our interactions with the medical system. 

Do not go back to that therapist, though.
Did you choose your therapist? I ask because some don't have that privilege. If you do, please change your therapist.
That’s just a bad therapist period. My husband is in school to be a counselor and there’s just so many red flags. Sorry you went through that. There’s definitely a counselor that can help you so much better. My therapist is one of my biggest supporters.
This sounds unacceptable and really traumatising to have to go through this. I'm sorry you've had such a shitty exchange with your therapist. You deserve so much better. I'm a therapist myself and unfortunately it seems to be common to find transphobic therapists. I'm always worried for any trans person. If you want help reporting your therapist please let me know. I'd be more than happy to help!
Exactly what you said. 
It makes me so professionally offended when  I see these posts. People are vulnerable with them, they claim to be a professional, and then they treat people like this. It makes my blood boil
Exactly
not a mental health professional but if you don't want to really talk at all you could cancel and cite refusal to acknowledge Gender Dysphoria to start a paper trail. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms-causes/syc-20475255
will do
yah and if she did it to op she'll probably do it to others
 I think the therpist was trying to say that being nonbinary is hard which I get but you can't just choose not to be yourself. not being yourself is a lot harder in the long term
This bitch straight up did malpractice. Seconding reporting her.

[But OP, please don't feel pressured to report her. Take care of yourself first.]
i don’t think so 😔 she works independently, so there’s no one else to go to
Just hopping in to add that yes if she is a licensed professional the governing body for her certification has a way to report. The ACA is an example, NASW as well
Same, I barely could read all of it, imagine being there to experience it! Sounds like hell. Please OP be safe and find a new therapist, everything about this was just SO wrong 😵‍💫
They're not supposed to. This is definitely against the ethics code and they need to be reported.
yeah i thought so too
i was just about to say that! archeologists say this all the time. they have to guess on what they were buried with, that’s all they can really go off of
oh thanks for telling me, i wasn’t aware of that
yeah my mum has said that she’s willing to learn about it, and she’s going to help me get top surgery :)
Depending on where you are you could try looking online for a queer friendly therapist, or even a queer therapist. There’s a few resources like the Trevor project and PFlag that you might be able to use to find a good therapist.
sorry to hear that, i hope you’ll be able to find someone good soon, maybe online?
it was bizarre to witness, she just pulled out every typical transphoic argument in the book
I’m sorry this happened to you, I hope you have or find someone better to talk to who supports you 💚
Sunflower seeds may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar as they contain vitamin E, magnesium, protein, linoleic fatty acids and several plant compounds.
before doing this OP: please research your areas laws on recording people sans consent in private settings. no matter how horrendous this woman is, it is not worth you getting into legal trouble.
Glad to hear you're leaving, no one should have to hear that from their therapist. Wishing you the best!
She has a licence I assume. That means an agency is regulating her. You can report her to that agency.
Maybe find sites to leave a bad review?
Here in the UK I believe it’s covered by the HCPC!
Me too! I also thought that she was projecting. She sounds like a very unhappy person who chose at some point to just repress her gender dysphoria and lean into social gender norms. 

When people have true self assurance they don’t beat your round the head with their world view. You accepting their world view or not has no bearing on their own opinion of themselves.

Self assurance is quiet. 

However, when people rely on external structures, such as societal values, gender norms, markers of status, etc, to bolster their sense of self, challenging those structures challenges their self concept and they go ballistic. 

I guess it is extra surprising from a “therapist” because one of our expectations of them is that they must have spent time looking inward and finding that deeper sense of themselves. But, I hear so many stories about bad therapists, I guess they didn’t all get the memo.

Sorry you had to go through that. 

But for what it is worth from an outside perspective you were clearly the person operating from a deeper sense of self knowledge and wisdom. While she was lashing out irrationally and from a place of insecurity. She was placing more value on the seeming of her own life than the being of her own life. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. You caring about being yourself more than seeming to be what society expects was threatening to her. She sounds deeply and desperately unhappy and you will do well to get clear of her.
Also especially since they’re going off of how the bones develop depending on muscle attachments and that humans aren’t that sexually dimorphic making it very difficult to sex people in general
Hopefully maybe! A Millennials would be nice
Pulled out the greatest hits, one after another. It’s clear cut
I hope you do as well.💞
Happy cake day
i’ll see what i can do
Cheers!
Please know this isn’t your fault. You don’t have a duty to report her but hopefully it will prevent someone else getting hurt. I hope you’re doing okay ❤️
If you're in the US, this looks like a useful guide: https://blog.opencounseling.com/check-a-therapist-license/

Binary trans to non binary?	"Did anyone else go from a binary trans identity to a non binary identity?

I have been out a FTM for the past like 4 years but I’m beginning to feel, I guess almost a reverse dysphoria about being so so so masculine. I was comfortable for a while but I’m starting to think I don’t enjoy being seen as a man much and I may be more feminine/in the middle.

It is extremely difficult because my transition thus far has been testosterone and top surgery and I am worried I made some mistakes now that I’m not sure if I am a binary man. I get very panicky because it’s not like I want to detransition and be a woman or anything, but i am not as comfortable with he/him and being perceived as a man all the time.

This is very scary because I have put so much effort into passing and being a man and for a while I was very comfortable but now I feel differently.

Did anyone else face this or something similar? I really need support"	"You're not de-transitioning. Your transition goals have just changed. You learned more about yourself. That's a good thing.
Yup. Transfem enbi here, and i get dysphoria whenever I’m too feminine or too masculine like you do. The balance is quite difficult, i have days i can’t even wear makeup at all, then i get dysphoria from feeling too masc 😩
First off, this sounds really tough! I feel for you. For a long time I thought I couldn't be trans at all because when I tested out trans man it felt as wrong as being a cis woman did. I think a lot of people got stuck with feeling a need to be one or the other. Society is still very stuck on the binary, and it can be so hard to realize the binary isn't the truth.

I don't think you made the wrong choices for you at the time. Lots of afab nonbinary people also use T and get top surgery! I'm planning bottom surgery too. And even though I haven't even gotten a date for my first top surgery consult, I'm already researching prosthetic breast forms, so I can have both shapes.

 But also...

Trans men are allowed to be feminine! We praise cis men for exploring their feminine sides. As a trans man, you deserve the same. You can absolutely live your life ""less masculine"" and still be 100% a man. You can wear skirts and makeup and do ""girly things"" and still be a man. 

And I don't mean drag — you can mess with gender norms in your daily life whatever your gender is.

Maybe being a man feels wrong right now because you're putting pressure on yourself to conform to a certain type of manhood that isn't *your* manhood. Do you think letting yourself be a feminine man for a whole might ease up some of the pressure?

We are always discovering more about ourselves and whether you're a man or nonbinary, you are valid. Taking the long road to finding yourself is OK. The amount of time it takes to be your true self is morally neutral — it's not bad or good to take a detour on the way; it just is what it is.
I think for me it was a big step when I realized that gender can be very fluid. You can feel completely comfortable as a man for a few years and then feel more comfortable as nb for a few years. It's okay for your identity to change and your current identity doesn't invalidate any of your past identities and vise versa. I was a he/him trans man for five years and I was fully a man and was on T and had top surgery. Now I'm a she/they genderqueer and I don't think that makes my physical transition any less worth it.
I actually had a similar experience, as have many other people I know. A lot of us actually *do* identify as detrans in some way, but it doesn't necessarily mean we're desisted from trans identity. Just that we had to course-correct for a transition that was too binary. A lot of people are really misinformed by TERFs on what detrans people can be like, so it can be scary to have an experience that could be ""counted."" But rather than tell you ""that's not detransition"" I'd present to you instead the knowledge that lots of detrans NB people in this exact situation exist, and it's up to you if you consider yourself one of us or not. You don't have to give up being trans to reverse or change your transition, regardless. 

I went on HRT for long enough that I started getting dysphoric about some of the changes. I stopped for a few years, but my intersex variation caught up to me and I had to go back on, so I'm sort of working with the same situation that no-E transfem people are, in the end? Having to work with what I got even if it feels like it's kinda working against me. It's fine. 

Medical transition doesn't have to be gender-affirming. It can be something you regret or had a mixed or rough experience with. That's ok. You can always course correct and move forward.
I felt that but at a hyper compressed timeline. I wanted to be a full blown woman, then I stepped back to non-binary. Honestly, I think my resting point is going to be genderqueer (GNC) trans woman.

Edit: thought I might explain. I feel like my _identity_ is a binary woman but my _expression_ is fluid/non-binary (whatever i feel, whenever i feel). So the social element of my gender is why I picked the label genderqueer.
When I came out, I came out as non-binary transmasc. I thought about identifying as a male and that just never felt right to me. I never wanted to be placed back into the box of gender and have tons of societal expectations on my shoulders about how I should and shouldn’t behave, dress, etc. I’ve got a beard, most everyone identifies me as a man, but I know that I’m not.

I don’t want the weight of having to perform masculinity to society’s standards. And you shouldn’t have to either.
i had a very similar experience, just in reverse. i came out as a trans woman when i was 15, and for so long passing was the most important thing to me. i even used to have nightmares about my hair being cut because i thought it would make me look like a man. well at 19 i had pretty much accomplished my goal. i was never misgendered, never given a side eye in the women’s restroom, and. it sucked. it felt like i was just as trapped in that binary as when i was presenting as a man. 

now i’m 20, i’ve shaved off all my hair, i wear masculine clothes when i want to, i use they/them pronouns, and i’ve never felt more free. it was terrifying at first, because i thought people would think i was detransitioning and i occasionally get called “sir”, but now even being called “sir” doesn’t bother me. 

so let me just say, it will be scary, and i know it’ll be weird inching away from masculinity, but you’ll be okay.
People are saying all kinds of great stuff here that I totally agree with. Just want to add though that we aren't static as people and our gender identities and/or presentations can change over time.
Yep, me! I was a binary trans man for 5 years and am now non-binary. I am “retransitioning” (term I prefer to detransitioning) by going off HRT. I regret some choices and the societal urge to present fully masc. I am now accepting being non-binary for me looks different than my body does now. I got terrible dysphoria from being clocked as a cis man. I’ve found a lot of support in r/actual_detrans which has quite a few folks who go from binary to non-binary trans identities, TERFs aren’t allowed, and it’s a safe place for me to talk about questioning my level of transition (but not being trans), and what I can do to change my presentation in another direction. You’re not alone.
I identify as both FTM and nonbinary, I think it’s just a journey of learning more about yourself. Personally I have some days where being hyper masc sets of dysphoria and some days where it’s euphoric. Some nonbinary folks want testosterone and top surgery too! It could be a case that now that physical dysphoria has gone you’re still discovering what makes you comfortable in other ways.
Even if you were to entirely detrans, as long as you understand that it was a view in your self that has been altered and isn't a fault within the trans community it is okay. 

It's okay to learn more about yourself and realize the information you had previously may not have been enough or you may have taken them in the wrong direction. That's okay! We all do it at times.
I did the exact same thing. After I had been in T and legally changed my name and gender, had too surgery etc. I realized I still enjoyed being feminine when dating straight men. There was a nostalgia about makeup and hair that I missed. 

So I stopped T and stopped cutting my hair. Bought some feminine clothes and wore them, painted my nails, put on makeup, raised my voice a little. Turns out a lot of what I did was to totally reversible. I swung really hard back to fem for about a year and now I’m back to an in-between: short hair, on T, mostly masc clothes but I do still present as very fem sometimes. 

I don’t love being non-binary yet, I have some internalized non-binary-phobia. But I have accepted that I don’t fit in a female box or a male box. I present how I feel and that’s pretty fuckin rad. Looking back I have always done what I felt was right for me at any given point in my transition(s) and that helped me to stop regretting things I did. Now I’m back to appreciating my top surgery and short hair :)
I've been having these same worries. I am a transfem enby and there are days where I just look at myself like ""did I make a mistake?""
Yup, not me, but I’ve seen it plenty. It’s ok for your identity to evolve. I can see the social pressure to be a binary man once you’ve made it that far as to be seen as one in the world. Also remember that man/woman don’t mean the same as masc/fem. You can still be a man if that how you feel but you don’t have to be masculine in ever way, at all times. That’s true for cis guys too, they just often reject it. 

Whatever you do, just be you! Categorization is overrated.
I identified as a binary trans woman for about the first year of my transition. 

Somewhere in there I got the feeling I was trying to ""kill off"" some intrinsic parts of myself and measure up to standards of dress/beauty that, while not in/of themselves are wrong, were harmful for my mental health. 

I now foe the last year have identified as a nonbinary transfeminine person and am very comfortable with my gender identity in a way I wasn't before. 

It's a totally valid experience as gender, for some of us, proves to be a moving target
This is how I discovered I was non-binary. I think it’s pretty normal
Even if you were detransitioning it would be perfectly okay, but it sounds like that's not what you're looking for. Often we're pushed to call ourselves binary trans in order to get access to the medical transition we need and it's completely understandable if you didn't realize you were nonbinary at first. I feel like this would've happened to me if I hadn't already known I'm nonbinary when I first started testosterone.

Just take it one step at a time and don't worry about how other people see your transition. And good luck.
I just wanted to say, this is such a brave and vulnerable share!

When there's potential criticisms towards our experience, it can be much easier to keep quiet. You being so brave is a gift for a huge group of people who relate and now feel less alone💜

Love to you, beautiful soul!
One of my friends, who's always been non binary but transitioned into looking more masculine, has decided to somewhat detransition to look more androgynous. I'm not completely aware of their journey but I could look into it and ask them questions to help you if you want?
Yeah. Genderfluid to agender to ftm to nonbinary. Been an interesting ride.
I identified as ftm for about 7 years! I now identify as nonbinary,  and seeing someone going through something similar to me is quite comforting. I ended up feeling like testosterone wasn't making me better, shaved my beard, and slowly got more adventurous. Be it my nails, doing my hair differently,  and buying more feminine clothing. 
There's nothing to panic about,  especially since gender is such a difficult thing to figure out.
Nonbinary IS trans
I thought I was simply a trans woman, and have been on hrt for the last six months. As I continue to unpack things, however, I realize that I'm actually fluidflux, with a gender that orbits femininity without ever settling down there.

There are days when I feel more masc and the feminisation of my body feels weird, but overall it still feels like the right thing to do, so I'm focusing on presentation changes to help with the dysphoria when that happens.
So I can talk to you about the experience of my friend, a transmasc enby (or ""polygender"" but this is getting more complicated). They identified more or less as enby since the beginning of their transition but that didn't stop them from taking testosterone. They even used mainly he/him at some point. But now they're more comfortable as ever in their non-binarity, and they state testosterone as one of the reasons.
Isn't that an interesting part of how this works. 
I'm M2F but had similar feelings about my birth gender, and have at times since transitioning definitely felt dysphoria the other way.
My personal solution is to just roll with it and generally speaking I just follow my euphoria wherever it leads..

Sometimes I also feel quite neutral,  which is also fine.

I think part of it is to separate mental from physical. 

Physically I can be doing something masculine or feminine, mentally I'm enjoying getting my nails done if I'm her, or I don't have time for this crap if I'm him.

There will always be times where I feel some level of dysphoria, that's OK, also for me my masculine half is big a powerful, and sometimes I need my protector back, so I reserve the right to bring him back anytime I need him without guilt or shame.

I don't know how it works from the other side, but if there are times you want to be soft and pretty or whatever fem means to you, then just be you and that's more than enough.

You still Da'Man, or maybe Da'Nonbianry. 

There's 50 shades of trans, so just find the balance that works for you.
I've definitely drifted from more feminine to more non-binary over time, although still leaning towards feminine. But then I always thought of myself as a tomboy, so I guess that tracks haha
Same here! Thought I was a binary trans man for years and had been on T a year. You’re definitely not alone :)
One of my siblings is currently going through this, so you're definitely not alone 💕
Literally same thing happened to me, I swung too far masculine and had to readjust my transition goals to something that felt more “me”. Now I’m FtN or FtX and use they/them pronouns instead of he/him.
Yeah, I know lots of people who've followed that path! There's no shame in it!
You might be more genderfluid as well. I was happy to identify as NB when I first came out, but am on T now and wondering if I'm a repressed trans man instead.  Sometimea though I feel like I miss my feminine side and feel weird for ""feminine"" gestures for example (until I remember all the fabulous gay men in the world) and realize that I am me and sometimes that presents one way or is interpreted another way by others. I actually think I'm a genderfluid Wizard who shape shifts depending on circumstances and mood. Definitely a delicate balance, but my new transition goal is to stay present with myself and do what feels most like me, knowing that it is all me. Hang in there. It isn't easy, but it can be really fun at times.
No worries. Gender identities can shift over time. I'm gender queer and somewhere smack dab in the middle between the binaries. All I ever knew growing up was that I didn't identify as being female or feminine but I didn't identify as male either, so I was always stuck as female till I realized there was another option other than just ""tomboy"". Learning about yourself is a process.
I'm still finding my comfortable spot when it comes to gender expression. I feel pretty solidly non-binary, but my expression is quite fluid. I don't feel like I have any useful advice to offer, but I do want to thank you for making this post. There's a wealth of wisdom and great advice here and I feel a lot more comfortable after reading through the discussion. I hope it's done the same for you 😊.
I (35) thought at first I may be a trans man (summer '20). I liked binding and all but the thought of being a trans man felt off.    

Then last spring I found out about nonbinary and later it being an umbrella term. Then later than all that, I found out about trans-fem & trans-masc.   

Later I felt I identified with Agender trans-masc. Because, although I don't want cis people assuming my gender. If they decide to pick one, I'd prefer they'd assume I'm a man. Plus there is
/r/FTMfemininity and some TikTokers who are trans men that wear dresses & skirts. Which seeing them gives me gender euphoria.     

To note I do want top surgery (no nips) and on a low dose of T. Then I plan to re-evaluate where I'm at and how I'm feeling. Because we're human and constantly changing. It's the spice of life.
Maybe check out the YouTube channel heycolanda? They’re a nb couple who were on testosterone for a while and eventually quit. I know one of them wants top surgery.
Don’t worry too much about it, you’re not making “mistakes”. You’re learning
more about yourself as you go. Everyone’s journey is different:)
I also see enbies who realise after some time that they are binary trans, so why shouldn't it be the other way around? Figuring stuff out takes time, and I don't see transitioning as a fixed way anymore. Every transition is different and it's totally ok if you're taking longer, taking less time, take turns, even go backwards. Gender is fluid :)
While I can’t relate to what you are going through exactly, I can hard related to the feelings of panic and identity confusion on the topic- I’ll share my experience in the hopes that maybe you’ll feel a little less alone/more validated. 

My agab is female- But I never fit into that box. I was aware of my love and attraction for women reaching back to my earliest memories and, before we really had words like nonbinary and before I had the framework to think about it the only option available to me for a long time was gender non-conforming butch lesbian. I never really thought about my gender tho- just my sexual orientation which was 100% women. And i learned how to be a good butch and what made women happy/what was expected of me. 

In the early 2000’s the informed consent model for HRT made transitioning and getting HRT suddenly exponentially more accessible (thank god) to transgender individuals. But it was actually a little jarring for me because it really felt like overnight all of the butch lesbians I knew were now trans men (I know they were always men, but this was how it felt at the time). Everyone expected that I was going to transition, which i never had any interest in doing, and I remember have feelings about “butch erasure” and i remember feeling really acutely that there was no place for me anymore. 

We were still all thinking in terms of binary gender tho- I knew I wasn’t a man, so by default I figured this must mean i am a woman. It wasn’t until maybe 5 years later when I started working at a clinic that specialized in transgender medicine and listening to people talk about feeling so strongly male or female that I realized I didn’t “feel” any sense of gender- I could not understand what people meant by this. I was fine in the space of “genderless butch lesbian” for another 10 years. 

I’ve always had varying degrees of mild dysphoria at various times in my life, but more around wishing I had something (a man’s chest or a penis) but never wanting to be rid of what I had. And i would have a sense of certain things - like I didn’t want to be a mom I wanted to be a dad. Again, I was still thinking in binary. But I never had any desire to live in and present as male in the world day to day. 

Anyways, 5 years ago I meet this pansexual woman who in one sentence turned my world upside down. I can’t even remember the context but I made some reference to my “butchness” as a reason for something and she said “I don’t care if you’re butch or not, I’m pan”. Well, who knew, all those years I had just been performing butch because it was what was expected of me, all of a sudden this ginormous weight was lifted and I was freed of this huge burden I had no idea I was carrying. 

She took it even further and started to really encourage and support me in my masculinity and this made me feel safe to explore my femininity as well. Through this process I discovered that I am agender most of the time but sometimes very genderfluid, especially when it comes to sex. 

Cue identity crises at the age of 35- my labels that i was so secure in didn’t fit right any more, and what i wanted and needed from a partner changed too. I’m still working it all out, and when I feel threatened or insecure I still sometimes retreat back behind the armor or butch lesbian because even though it doesn’t fit right anymore I’ve worn it so long when i put it on it’s impenetrable (if that makes any sense). I’m trying to figure out where and with whom I fit now, and i sometimes feel guilt and shame about that, and i sometimes feel terrified that I will never find a partner that will love all parts of me and my gender and that I will settle out of fear. 

Coming from a place of someone who had what they thought was a rock solid identity for 20 years this shit is hard, and it’s confusing, and apparently it can change throughout your life or as you get a new framework or point of reference. I have no answers, but at least you’re not alone and at the end of the day figuring out what feels good and right for you is more important than what anyone thinks or wants or expects about you.

Edit- some spelling and punctuation for easier reading/clarification
Kinda opposite? I'm starting think I'm trans instead of nb after thinking I was nb first
Lots of people re-transition. There's still a lot of pressure in the community for binary transition. There's a long his story of denying trans health to third gender people as well, so lots went with the program in order to get needed care. There's now more space to be nonbinary, so it's easier to identify properly.
Hey, I am in the very same boat as you I think.

I came out with 14, almost 10 years ago, started T with 18 and I stopped taking it last February after panicking about my identity throughout the pandemic. 
4 years on T and I realized it wasn't right for me anymore. 

I know I am 100% trans, not detransitioning, I really don't feel like a women but heck I don't feel like a man either. 

And I guess you are going through simlair things rn.

Feeling super confused and lost after going through all those hurdles and stressors, possibly fighting with parents, just to realize you might missed something is really scary.

But I think it is quite common, normal, human. In all points of live, not just transition. We are after all very clumsily trying to figure out who we are as people. 

Things will be okay I am positive of that. Give yourself time and try to navigate what you want for yourself now.



If you wanna Chat or something, feel free to DM me ☺️
I had the same thing. I felt like being non-binary was bad for a long time so clearly my only option was to transition to female. That didn’t last obviously
ha this happened to me very recently. identified as ftm for about four years, now i'm agender. i'm even happier with my new identity than my old one. stuff changes i guess. hope you find something you're comfortable with soon for your sake
I transitioned from feminine > masculine > androgynous personaly. Was FTM but now I’m definitely non-binary. I was on T but now I consider myself a non-binary lesbian.
Honestly this happened to me the more I learn about gender, and how its a social construct like. I feel like a boy, but not a Man. I dont fit into societies expectations kf a man so im not the same gendee as peopl usually mean when they say man, even if u desire a traditionally male body and like he/him pronouns. Idk if i explained well
even though I'm transfem i feel this a lot. I never started medically transitioning because i live in an eastern european hellhole but when after suppressing myself for 4 years i managed to accept I'm trans. And i concluded that I must be mtf and all this enby stuff was just a coping mechanism (spoiler it wasn't) but the idea of being a woman also caused me dysphoria as much as being a man. I later accepted that I'm non binary and it was that simple all along. This is just my personal experience though. and as someone else said in the comments, men can be feminine too if they want to be, what's important is to feel comfortable in your skin and clothes. you can present however you want and it will never invalidate your identity <3 I wish you luck on your journey of self discovery.
for me it was just that i didn’t like being labeled as a gender because neither for me well enough. i transitioned from cis male to genderfluid to non binary.
I think our idea of gender is always changing and what we’re comfy with is always adapting. Give yourself some grace and love as you go through this journey
You aren’t alone! So thankful for transition and I identify as non-binary trans masc but I feel you! I want to express my non-binary-ness more and not present as a cis-guy (heaven forbid Lolol!)
This is totally normal! I honestly think about this all the time as someone who's been out as a trans man for over a year now. Gender is such a strange thing and I genuinely think it can be helpful to just say fuck all labels for a while and do whatever you want. My biggest fear regarding changing my label is that people will stop referring to me using male language - ae man, guy, boyfriend, etc. But at the end of the day it really only matters what the people you love refer to you as :)
You're not alone, friend.  


I did my best impression of the binary trans girl thing for my first five or so years of transition, but in hindsight, I feel like I was afraid of being seen as too queer. Transitioning at all was a step in the right direction, but I'm more comfortable focusing on what I need to do to alleviate dysphoria rather than picking a box or side to fit into.  


Change can be scary, but I'm proud of you for talking about these feelings and hope you're able to move towards greater comfort.
I flip flopped between trans woman, and cis man for years before transitioning, and realizing I am non-binary. Still not 100% sure on my gender. Try not to stress about fitting into some mold, and do what makes you feel best. I felt like I needed to change my name, and ditch he/him pronouns at the start but realized I didn’t have to just to be trans enough.
I was in a similar boat, thought I was a trans man but trying to be masculine felt just as forced as living as a girl. There’s no need to feel guilty about it, you just needed to explore your identity a little bit more.
For sure this is a thing. I can't say I got dysphoria from transitioning to binary female, but I've gotten a lot of euphoria from going back towards appearing more androgynous.

I think a lot it is that when I first started transitioning like 12 years ago, being nonbinary wasn't well known or understood. I didn't have the language to know and express that I'm nonbinary. I have that language now though, and I've adjusted my presentation to meet those needs.
Check out r/ftmfemininity they're a great sub for trans guys to accept themselves still liking some feminine aspects of their identity.
I’m a non-binary person who is on T and had top surgery, if those things make you happy then you don’t have to stop/revert because you no longer ID as a man. If T doesn’t make you happy anymore then feel free to go off it. There is no one way to be trans and non-binary, so whatever makes you happy and comfortable in your body is the right thing ❤️
Identity is a complex thing that can change. Maybe yours has changed. There's nothing wrong with that.
Do trans guys have to be cis or binary in nature? That seems a bit disingenuous to me. Someone aptly put it in an NB/TransMasc interview I watched, if we are to support cis AMAB males’ rights to use makeup or to wear pink, then we ought not judge trans under such harsh and militant terms as a means of proving their validity as males. 

I cannot speak for you and I am sure that your experiences and feelings are not inherently based on superficial factors like those used in the example above. Those were on the point of making it clear that you dont have to be what is considered masculine (gender expression) in order to be trans (gender identity), so as to debunk any of those common “toxic masculinity” footholes anyone is capable of falling into.

My ID is NB/TransMasc so, if you would like to talk on those points then feel free to DM me. Gender isnt always so straightforward, same as sexuality, and I dont feel anyone should have to be sworn in for life just because they have discovered a true part of themselves in one, and then later on discover another truth of themselves elsewhere. Easier said than done but it is all a part of the journey of self-acceptance.
I think k a lot of people who aren't cis experience this pendulum swing, where in the beginning it's kind of thrilling to see yourself successfully pull off a feminine/masculine/androgynous etc presentation, but as time goes on that can start to feel like another performance. As you become more comfortable with who you are, there's less pressure to prove to others (or yourself) you're that. You get to just be.
It's more common than you think. Me and my boyfriend when from trans girls to he/theys over quarantine
yep!! i used to identify as a binary trans man, but now i’m identifying as a genderqueer transmasc :)
i know a bunch of trans masc people who feel like you, OP! i can relate as well (altho i’ve never passed as a dude).
Masculinity is as much a spectrum as any gender. David Bowie, Prince, Boy George...to name a few men who blur(ed) the line.


Either way, being nonbinary doesn't undo the progress you've made.
Hi I’m non-binary but usually ftm groups feel more my vibe. It’s hard trying to navigate a very binary mainstream and finding oneself, and it’s valid for us to feel different ways at different points in our lives. 💓 I’ve just (3 months ago) got top surgery! And am on low dose T.
gender is fluid! have you thought of trying he/they?
I think I can relate, OP. I’m two years on T Identifying as a trans guy using he pronouns and I’ve been experiencing an increasing amount of anxiety trying to make it all fit but it feels complicated. I started out using he/they but they made me feel dysphoric like I wasn’t being taken ‘seriously’ as on the guy side of things and I really wanted to feel that male homosociality so I just started using he/him only. I love everything T has done for me but I still get my period and it’s been making for some major mood swings/dysphoria/insecurity in a weird way I wonder if it’s affecting my mental health…I have a big anxiety that somehow T is wrong for me even tho I love it’s effects and that’s why I’ve been so anxious and depressed…what I really feel is fragmented: like transitioning has made me push the more female or feminine parts of me inside and then they come bubbling up when I’m alone sometimes and I’ll suddenly feel SO female it freaks me out…then on good days or out among people I just feel like my guy-ish self again…which has never been a strong identity for me, more of a desire to occupy that gendered place. so the compartmentalization freaks me out, and makes me wonder if I’m confused or repressed or just didn’t integrate my past identity right and it’s coming back to bite me. When others talk about how easy and happy and confident they feel since transitioning I doubt myself. I love my name and masculine presentation but I still feel like I’m faking some days, tho the idea of going back to female or feminine makes me sick and panicky, it’s not what I want in any form. I just want to understand these parts of myself I understand as non-male, and integrate them in a way that lets me feel confident dating queer men as a man-ish person. As it is I’m so terrified of feeling like I’m ‘faking’ a male identity around gay men it won’t let me go out and date any of them and it’s been a huge problem as I’m really lonely and feel undateable. I feel like I should be dating like, bi-curious straight men in this weird way so I can be my full self. Most of this is in my head I think and if I could just meet some guys who I felt could see my sort of ambigenderedness and be attracted to it I’d feel a lot better and not worry if I’m making a mistake.
Thank you I needed to read that
This answer though 🥰🥰🥰🥰 yasssss ❤❤❤

Thank you so much OP for sharing 🖤
This, I've changed in the same way
I know it’s such a struggle, I try and do one thing and the next day I don’t like it lmaoo
It's affirming to read someone's experience is similar to my own
Dude you don’t even understand how much this reply means to me. You’ve given me a lot to think about and I’m feeling a bit less like a total weirdo, especially because I was looking for prosthetic breasts as well but I was so worried no one who ever would get top surgery would ever look for that and I thought I was A total freak for it, so thank you so much just for responding here. I really really appreciate this and I’ve got a lot to contemplate and I’m feeling a lot more comfortable now
Thank you, that means a lot. I really need to work to achieving that mindset. Seriously, thanks <3
Yes that’s really how I’m feeling, I hate all the gender expectations I want to get away from them
Thank you. I’ll check out that sub, I appreciate your reply
happy cake day
You are already whole, my friend 🖤

We’re thousands feeling the same and not being very talkative about it, phobia is a thing even in the trans community
Transmasc nonbinary here, on T, looking for top. Honestly that's my ideal chest situation, having the option for boob or no boob. Top surgery takes the limiter off of your chest customization options imo.
It's a long process! I'm so glad the comment helped.

I started openly identifying as nonbinary and seeking physical changes at 35, and before that I spent like a solid 5 years researching and considering first. Honestly, I wish I'd moved faster and risked more ""mistakes"". But I can't change the past so I'm making the best of now. I'm enjoying my girly librarian hair buns with my new facial hair, and my flowy poofy skirts with man-hair legs. It might take me the rest of my life to truly become myself but as long as I'm working towards it, I'm OK with that.
💚
Thanks!
I haven’t but I’m definitely going to check that out now, and that sucks there isn’t one for transfems, someone should make that, thank you for showing me this
I've started to move more towards trans spaces where there is no rigid division between trans and nonbinary identities and where it's absolutely accepted that you can move from a more binary way of transitioning to a more nonbinary one and vice versa. I might have been too long in this bubble cause to me, this would be absolutely no big deal if someone who identified as binary trans previously came out as nonbinary. The same amount of respect and love. 

It saddens me deeply that there are still parts of the queer community where this is not accepted. But you are right, we are thousands and taking time to find your gender identity or long term transition goals is not a flaw at all.

Meme I made		"Have you tried turning tiddy off and back on again?
I haven’t worn a bra since I was 18 and now I’m 25. I didn’t like that bras reminded me that I have boobs. Then I tried on a binder and made me feel worse cuz it felt like I was wearing a bra again and did not make my chest flat like I was hoping for. So until I get top surgery I’ll just deal with having boobs.
Binding - you don't see tiddy but you are constantly reminded tiddy is there by the restrictive garment :(
This is sciences fault! We need the tiddy we can pop off and on like hats! Just pop em off, leave em at home when we feel like!
I like how I look with a binder on but most days i just wanna wear clothes and be able to breath . My problem is, I am a d cup so any movement causes movement ya know? I found recently underworks has a like thin binder tanktop. Does very little compression so it's super comfy and it feels safe to wear all day but it's just a a tank top so no bra feeling and it stops the movement . Feels like the best compromise.  It feels like just a kinda form fitting tanktop i used to wear under clothes when I wore women's clothes still.
Perhaps your panic attack was triggered by tight binding. Our body is  programed to react with panic of our airflow is impeded.
I feel best when I just go braless, but I'm also like a D cup so they're very *there* >:|
task failed successfully
Nah that makes complete sense. You can ignore them when your not focused on trying to hide them. Not that people should bind if they want to
Tbh, going braless is more euphoric for me than binding. It's just a matter of finding shirts that look okay without a bra underneath
I relate to this. Dysphoria can be fluid too ~
The binder took your dysphoria with it when you took it off
Heh... tiddy XD
I have three mods: pushup, sports bra, and no bra. I switch between them based on how I feel about my tits in the morning. Pushup is when I want to flaunt them around proudly, sports bra being the equivalent to binders, and no bra is just when I want to forget they exist. It feels chaotic AF.

It's more chaotic now that they gained some extra size, like I'm always super aware they exist and I don't know if that's normal.
I’m like this! I don’t hate my boobs I hate the oppressive boulder holders
I'm simultaneously very lucky and unlucky in that my tits are so smol I don't need a binder, but my nipples are the size of fucking ping-pong balls, so I still need a bra just to hide them...
aw
SAME BRUH
Same deal with gaffs for transfems w bottom dysphoria 😓 it's like theres no fuckin winning w/o surgery
This model does exist, but not all people have it.

It seems most end up with EITHER detachable penis OR detachable tiddy. NOT both. And you don't get to choose from the get-go which model you get. Gotta aftermarket your way into it if you want a different model.

I want my money back.
At least there’s detachable penis?
But I tend to relax and get asleep when I put my binder on. I know I shouldn't. But my body does it by itself. What does that mean then?
I just looked up gaff. It sounds neat.
Honestly i can't tell. I like to do rope bondage and having rope around the chest can really be calming as well. I think it might depend on the situation.
Loool it's better than tape imo but it's also not super comfy. It's kinda like stretching some scrunchies to fit around your thighs, hips and junk 😐 and then pulling that tight so said junk doesn't fall out from the prepubescent holes you crammed it back into. But it IS a nifty tool when ya need it!
I want to try this.
Yeah. The site said to wear it sparingly. Especially if you intend on having biological kids one day. To think about freezing your sperm if you use it. 

It seems like a binder but for penises and testes."	xsdxpg	NonBinary	689	0.99	2022-09-30 22:01:43
(He/They) I’ve felt confident enough in my identity to wear cute dresses without dysphoria lately :)		"You look great! Hope I am able to do this someday too
You look fantastic!  I hope that's me someday.  I tried a sundress this weekend and felt terrible until I changed.
Yay! I'm glad to hear that, because you look lovely in that dress!! You should wear them as often as your comfortable with. ☺️❤️ You look great!
Yeah this is adorable and you are absolutely killing it, you look so cute and summery!
My goodness, you're adorable!!!!
Just paying you a compliment I apologize if I made you feel uncomfortable I was under the impression that everyone in these communities are trying to be positive and uplifting for one another, I'll refrain from making any  further comments towards you

In the past few days I've been somehow embracing my feminine side a bit more, it's been quite nice and gave me less dysphoria than fighting that energy!		"I hear that. It's about a personal balance and your own comfort more than anything really. 👌🏾
Not fighting either side of me is a struggle sometimes. Glad you're embracing it.

You look lovely.

Denied top surgery	"Went on my last meeting today where they basically told me that being nonbinary isn’t a thing and that they only treat people that are trans with gender dysphoria. Two years ago they said I’m nonbinary bc I’m obese…. then I lost 15cm in my waistline out of spite. Now they said I’m showing too much progress so I have the ”capability to live with my struggles.” Fuck Sweden. LGBT inclusive my ass lmfao

Also doesn’t help that I’m autistic so they just think I’m being confused.

EDIT; oh gosh, I didn’t really expect to get 40+ comments so this is a bit overwhelming but thank you guys for the support !!

I had been advised by most of my FTM trans friends to lie about my identity but sadly it was a bit too late for that as I was halfway through my meetings. 

The reason I didn’t lie is because after the first meeting, the doctor told me that the gov had gotten more inclusive and included nonbinary people. I had thought to myself: 
”Oh, I’m getting lucky!! Guess there is no need to lie.” 

The meeting I went to yesterday she informed me that.. the gov had removed that right once again. She really wanted to help me but she was simply just not allowed to anymore. The only other organisation that included nonbinary people is across the country and now that has also been limited by the gov.
They’re really just trying to limit us from getting help and being happy.

Next step will be time consuming or money consuming and honestly at this point I’d just want to go the money route despite how limited my wallet is. 

Oh well. I’ll get through this eventually :’)"	"Whattttt so sorry to hear this D: 
Is going private an option for you?
Lie to them I guess?
I'm sorry to hear this.
I also live in a country where they don't recognise non-binary as valid. Didn't even try it here. There's only one gender clinic with 10 years wait.

I'm getting my top surgery next week. Going abroad where you don't need any medical proof, just mutual acceptance. Downside is that you need the money for that. But I couldn't be more excited right now.

Have you looked into this possibility?
Sadly its the same thing in Canada (at least when I got top surgery). Although I do have gender dysphoria, I said I was a trans man because I heard that the surgeons will deny people who are nonbinary from getting top surgery.

I'm so sorry about that. It's not fair.
They thought your gender identity was caused by obesity? 🙄
You ""kids"" are trailblazers! Keep fighting for your right.

I'm 53. I'm nonbinary. I have always wished I could have my boobs removed. They get in the way. Bras are awful, uncomfortable and damaging. I don't use them so why have them?

But for me there was no surgery available because I was born a woman and women have boobs. You ""kids"" have changed all of that. 

Duck that. Push. Fight. Change doctors. You deserve to be the best you that you can be.

I'm proud of you. Good luck.
If you are looking for advice: lie to them

If not, man im so sorry. Its bullshit that they don’t recognize your gender or respect your wishes.
idiots will blame everything on obesity
I'm so sorry to hear this.
 I always thought if there's any country in the world, where enby top surgery would be covered it's sweden.

*Sigh.*

In germany there is the option to flat out lie to all doctors and psychiatrist/psychologists that you are a binary trans* guy (you then still may need a ""good"" reason for not wanting to go on T ; or find a doctors who is accepting and understanding and willing to lie to insurances with you )

Or

You pay for it on your own- most places I've looked into also have options for payment plans- 

I don't know if any of those things are an option for you.

I wish you all the best and hope you'll be able to find a way eventually.
Transphobia and ableism wow.
????? Goofy as hell.

Pull a fast one and just say you're a dude. What're they gonna do, put your boobs back in once they do the surgery?
You would think that they would support nonbinary people since they’re the same country that officially implemented they/them pronouns in their language
Ugh I'm so sorry. Unfortunately when I go to the Dr I have to larp the ""Hello it is me, He/Him super binary man and I love monster trucks and fishing!"" in order to get healthcare. It honestly feels impossible to force them to understand the nuances of gender, so my only advice is to just lie. It sucks but the end result made it worth it for me.
Yeah, Sweden sucks. r/transnord recommends lying about it and saying you're FtM.
🤗 (If you like)
Find a new doctor/therapist.
I feel your pain, I was denied in Germany a few years ago because I naively believed they'd accept non-binary people. I'm so sorry this happened to you.
can you go back and say, ""so after some soulsearching it turns out I'm ftm""? or can you approach a new care organization to start fresh?
I'm so sorry this happened to u

The gatekeeping system is so fucking disgusting in the EU 

This is just institutional oppression, nothing else
Pal, you better lie.
So sorry to hear this and I hope you find another way forward.

Sweden is honestly the most conformist non-affirming place I've ever been to and I'm from Africa.
Hi from Stockholm. I wanted radical reduction because my chest was giving me dysmorphia. I went to Kry to a GP ask about that. And they told me “that kind of things u do privately “.
I told her it’s not the case, that I can be diagnosed and get my surgery. So they put me in a waiting list to a clinic that does it. 2 years waiting time for the first appointment, and then it can take 2 years to be diagnosed. The GP was calling me “transsexual” coz her English wasn’t good and my Swedish isn’t enough to talk about medical issues.

I could have a regular reduction as I qualified but then they would make it just a bit smaller, “proportional to by body”, which I am sure it’s not what I need. Long story short I went privately in Dec…
Feel you 💔❤️
Lie, many Non Binary people to do it to get care. 
I was lucky i didn't need to lie, but about half of my Docters asked if i wasn't just a trans man. Because I'm really masc leaning.
So sorry to hear that.
What the fucking fuck. I’m so sorry. That’s not okay
I'm sorry you're going through this right now!! One of my partners is Swedish and they've expressed having a hard time getting trans health care. The trans healthcare system in Sweden truly seems to be garbage.
Honestly, I would send this info to the news. Read just now in DN about how a tv profile who appears to be nb (använder hen som pronomen men är fem-presenting) apparently had few problems getting breast implants to better conform to their gender. They might have done it through private means, was a long text and don't quite remember, but at least the topic is getting a bit of a spotlight at the moment
I’m so sorry your going through that, I hope something works out soon for you!
Lie. Get what you need.
i shall sprint to sweden and commit murder for you
The fact that I knew this was one of the Scandinavian countries just by reading the first few sentences omg..  
That sounds horribly frustrating and we got a pretty similar situation here in Norway from what I've heard. I'm definitely planning on just telling my doctors that I'm a trans man (technically half-true, so it's fine) because anything else is way too big of a risk. Progressive countries like ours shouldn't be this behind when it comes to trans healthcare. Super frustrating tbh
As a nonbinary person who is also seeking top surgery, this is my biggest fear and I'm so sorry you had to go through that. 
You are valid in your identity, and I urge you to not give up on getting what you need to be comfortable in your body. 
Much love, friend!
I’m just stopping by to show some solidarity. This sucks, it’s wrong of them to deny you this, and I’m sorry that it’s complicating your journey even further.
Gaddam Sweden sure is handing out the backhands for troons today. In another sub a trans girl said they told her she has to be socially transitioned for a year (wearing skirts and makeup out before passing) before they allow her HRT. 

wtf I thought Sweden was like the beat place in the world to live or some shit
Jävla dårar!
That sucks! Exactly the reason I never wanted to transition medically (I'm also in Sweden).
well.. yes.
Em isbitnstill a demand that you get sterilzed before you can under go g""gender affirming care""?
I'm sorry.
it MIGHT be? There is another organisation but its all across the country. it has recently gotten a rule that I need a doctors note that my doctors arent allowed to give bc I’m nonbinary so it’ll be a bit hard
This is, sadly, the way. The amount of times I've needed to lie to doctors due to gender bias is infuriating.
What country are you traveling to?
How much does it cost? Im from the uk and the guidance says they only do top surgery on people who have been on T for 2 years. Im not interested in going on T but have a lot of top dysphoria. Cost for private surgery here is like 10000. Way outta my budget.
Good luck with your surgery btw and let us know how it went!
That's genuinely baffling to me. I'm in the southeastern US and like nobody had an issue (and I'm AFAB and generally femme presenting). Like... its your body and if you want to lob your tatas into the abyss then you should be able to lob your tatas into the abyss.
Wait, they will? :(  
I'm a Canadian enby who has thought about top surgery but never mind, I guess...
Really? I know several non binary people who got their top surgery covered by the Canadian govt in Ontario.
Anti-fatness is the real disease - it makes people act like monsters and treat those in larger bodies as less than human.  Like so what if someone’s fat?! (A word which I use in a neutral sense) If they want to chop their boobs or get any kind of gender affirming surgery, care, joint replacements, etc., why tf are they being denied - I do not buy this utter bullshit about ‘well the anesthesia is harder to do and dangerous and blah blah blah - like no, because you’re happy enough to rush someone into surgery and take their money when it’s a bariatric surgery.  But God forbid fat folks have access to life-improving care of other types.  SMH🫠  Bigotry is so gross.
Can confirm. Everything from my intelligence to my health to my gender to my sexual orientation to my political convictions is somehow caused by and/or invalidated by my weight. It's maddening.
Do you have tips for dealing with the psychiatrist examinations in Germany? I've talked to another guy about this and he said that I won't get their approval bc I'm diagnosed with anxiety disorder and now I'm (ironically) too scared to continue looking for one
Exactly. This makes my future look darker, too be honest
Unfortunately my understanding is that Swedish authorities work hard to shut down all providers that do not conform to their rigid rules. That sucks terribly badly but medical tourism is an option.
Ya
Barcelona, Catalonia. I have surgery with Dr. Brasó
Yeah, it's exactly the same here in Ireland.
In Barcelona you're looking at 5-6k in a good clinic, maybe less if a less known clinic. They're also more used to doing them surgeries over there, so I do trust them more than if I was to get it here.
[deleted]
It really depends where you are in Canada, don't lose hope! The place I went was fine with NB people getting surgery
Not everywhere! I've actually never heard of that, its disappointing to know parts of Canada are less progressive. But, my friend is non-binary, they're not on HRT (they dont plan to transition that way), and they recently got top surgery in Vancouver :) I believe the wait was much less than a year and it cost them like $15 lol (had to pay for anesthetic)
Not everywhere and not every surgeon! Mine was covered by OHIP and this was back in 2017-2018. Things may be different now, but back then I had to lie about being nonbinary.
Oh mine was covered too! I only paid $2000 out of pocket after the OHIP coverage.  


I'm saying moreso that I had to lie that I was a binary trans man (and also that I didn't have any mental health issues) in order to get top surgery. This was back in 2017/2018. Most nonbinary people I talked to had told me to say I was a trans man because many of them were denied for being nonbinary. Others were for being autistic.
My biggest recommendation is going to/calling/email-ing a dedicated counseling for trans*.
They know the local doctors, psychiatrists , etc and frequently deal with health insurance relate trans* issues.

Having other diagnoses does not automatically mean you can't get a diagnosis for dysphoria, being trans*, etc and medial letters and access to at least parts of trans healthcare.

There are people (even frequent psychiatry in-patients with multiple diagnoses) that get at least indication letters and HRT...

Approval for surgeries is in most cases a long and complicated process, often with rejections, for all sorts of reasons (according to my friend who was in contact with a trans counseler in a big city in NRW, she started her process in 2022)
Quite frequently only not accepting the decision of your Krankenkasse and going to court gets the final approval... 

I'm sorry I don't have more details or more positive things to share, I hope it was helpful anyways.
I hope there is some kind of support existing in your area - knowledge about who and what to look for (and what to avoid) can make daunting tasks much less scary.
Thanks a bunch! Gives me some hope for the future.
Oh I’m well aware that I’m one of the lucky people and not everyone can access care. I don’t personally have anyone telling me I can’t do what I’m doing (well nobody with the power to stop me).
This was in Ontario and back in like 2016-2018 for me. It was covered by OHIP for me besides $2000 (to make it 'look nice'). But yeah, things might be different now!  
I just know that prior to my top surgery, I had nonbinary friends who advised me to say I was a binary trans man."	10wcdoi	NonBinary	632	1.0	2023-02-07 20:36:20

Your self-deprecation may be harming people.	"""I don't deserve to be called nonbinary?"", ""Am I too ugly to be nonbinary?"", ""Am I X enough to be nonbinary?"", ""I'm AXAB so I can't be nonbinary without surgery"" and all of their fellow statements, I'm talking about you.

**Your gender identity is not a milestone.**

It's not an aesthetic, it's not a body type, it's not a race you need to win. It's your gender.

Posting self-deprecating (and I'm using that term with the conscious choice to give the benefit of the doubt that that's what these posts are about, without intending to be slights or have ulterior motives) posts about how you don't ""qualify"" as nonbinary does, even if you don't intend to, *harm* to everyone else browsing.

Just to list a few ill impacts, intended or not, that these statements end up doing off the top of my head:

* **Shoving people with low self-esteem about themselves under the bus.**

""Am I too ugly to be nonbinary?"", asks a person and posts a selfie, genuinely having the misinterpretation or trauma related to gender issues that you need to be attractive to qualify as your gender.

Meanwhile, another user sees the selfie, believes the person to be more conventionally attractive than they are (*especially* if the person seeing it has qualifications that already make them ""ineligible"" to being seen as beautiful by their cultural beauty standards), and learns the lesson, ""well, if that person is questioning it, then the bar must exist, and I am *certainly* don't qualify.""

* **Othering nonbinaryness.**

""I don't deserve to be called a woman.""

""Am I too ugly to be a man?""

""Am I curvy enough to be a woman?""

Most cis binary people don't ever feel the need to ask these questions. At most, in the context of people who have experiences of being marginalised out of their gender (usually womanhood), but even then, it's usually in the context of ""to be seen as"", and often acknowledged to be the result of societal lenses rather than that 'woman' or 'man' are sacred categories you need to complete labours of Heracles to qualify for.

*So why do we do this to nonbinary people?*

* **Hurting people who have experiences with being marginalised out of their previous identities by subjecting them to similar standards again in their new-found self.**

Yeah, I wasn't done yet. People who have experiences of having seen their AGAB gender as 'conditional' due to ableism, racism, fatphobia, misogyny, et cetera, do not need having those same pressures applied to them now. We managed to accept a wider spectrum of womanhood, a wider spectrum of manhood, now we *need* to get better about not just grabbing those same boxes and applying them to nonbinary people.

* **Equating your transition goals as the right image for being nonbinary.**

Especially us with the goal of ""indiscernible gender"" tend to be faulty of this. I very specifically ask for AFAB nonbinary people to mind how they talk about ""looking nonbinary"" versus ""looking more masculine"". Feminine nonbinary people, and nonbinary people with different bodies deserve to be here also.

Androgyny doesn't equal being nonbinary, and while you're more than allowed to strive for an androgynous appearance, *please* don't equate it to ""looking non-binary"". Especially because...

* **Perpetuating sexism.**

...more often than not, the image of androgyny, as it's seen in the context of stereotypical nonbinaryness, is ""vaguely masculine."" The image of a non-binary body is an AFAB person who has altered their body, which ends up perpetuating not only stereotypes of what being non-binary means, but also equates AMAB bodies as ""neutral"" and AFAB bodies as ""other.""

(Tangentially related: that post about genitalia, while *hopefully* meant to criticise people's expectation of nonbinary people, ended up specifically equating bodies with vulvas as ""sexual and other"", which brought up a lot of righteous anger and shame in especially AFAB people who have already had to deal with a lifetime of being defined as sex toys for consumption.)

**I don't believe any of the people here asking these questions or out-putting these rants are being malicious**, not unless they prove themselves otherwise. **But you do need to be aware of the impact your words have.**

* If you are talking about societal expectations, *state that*, and point your dagger at the people putting those expectations instead of other nonbinary people.
* Separate your personal transition goals from nonbinary as a label.
* Don't equate your dysphoria with the implication that there are standards for being nonbinary.

**TL:DR; Watch for what you imply to be a fact in your speech, because someone more impressionable may take it as one.**"	"Thank you!! I know most of these sorts of posts probably come from a place of insecurity, and looking for confirmation of “yes, you TOO are nonbinary! And enough!” But you totally hit on the unnamed uneasiness I couldn’t explain
I think this also goes for people who are insecure about whether or not they can claim the word trans as a nonbinary person. It's okay to feel however you feel! But how you express that may tell other people that they can't claim that label either
I really like this post because it's goal isn't to shut down important discussions for us to have, but rather to emphasis the need for self awareness and specificity.

That said, I do think it's absolutely important that people who are new to talking about their identities may not understand a lot of the nuance. I lurked for a long time before I started commenting, and I did a lot of external research. But I don't know that it's fair to expect that of people who are in pain and don't have the vocabulary to express it safely.

Not that any of us owe it to be anyone else's therapist, but that it is important that we can speak what we think we feel and hope that someone will be kind enough to share their experience to help give context to our pain.

So yeah, absolutely. We should have this or something very much like it somewhere handy, but I wish there was a sub, a tag, something we could give people where they can spill out what they're feeling and not have people who can't handle that have to stumble across it. Maybe there already is and I just don't see it (I have observation issues sometimes).

Just thinking.
Yes! This needs to be pinned as guidance for all posts here.
I agree with this in principle, but likewise agree with other commenters who have pointed out the very real need to express these feelings, especially among those who understand. For this type of discussion, I would suggest r/NonbinaryTalk. They don’t allow photos (so you will not see any photos asking for affirmations, whether people “pass”, etc) but it is a good place to talk through these emotions and doubts.
Thank you so much. I have seen so many of these posts lately and it has really started to alienate me from this community so I’m so happy someone said something.

I feel like especially the posts that are about AGAB are really reinforcing my feeling that we are only seen as “menlite” or “woman lite” and it’s so distressing. I’m nonbinary. That’s it. I don’t want to be lumped in with people based on my agab, because it isn’t my gender.

Also people asking For woman and afab enby spaces are terfs.
While I see where you're coming from, I also don't think it's as dangerous as you're implying and can actually be helpful overall. It can even be educating and therapeutic in a lot of cases.

You more often than not, almost always really, see someone replying to the self-deprecating person and explaining why they are valid. First of all, you have one person who is going to feel better and feel more valid, and whoever else that feels like that and reads that will feel more valid. It can be extremely positive for people to get validated for more than just that one person.

This post also implies that someone should know better. Often they don't and that's why they made that comment in the first place. This doesn't apply to like ""do I look non-binary"", but more so ""I don't think I deserve to be called non-binary because so-and-so"". They literally don't know better and don't realize that this is not the right way to think about it, so they're not being self-deprecating for the sake of it, but more out of ignorance and probably wouldn't realize this post applies to it. I've said I didn't think I deserved the label trans because I didn't transition in any form. That was my own ignorance, and people told me, no, I don't identify as my AGAB so I can absolutely use that label. This post wouldn't have enlightened me that I shouldn't say that. It was ignorance, not even knowing that it hurts people, just thinking that's the way things are and that label is ""earned"" in a way I hadn't.

I think there's not much usefulness in telling people not to make self-deprecating comments, because often they pop out and feel just like reality to the person, not like self-deprecation. People are legitimately depressed, don't realize they are speaking out of low self-esteem, and have difficult issues with how they look at themselves. You can even end up targeting neurodivergent people who might be in depressed episodes, basically telling them to keep shit to themselves unless they have something positive to say about themselves. Maybe a bit more extreme but it's like, ""you're saying depressing things and making others depressed, you're hurting people by being in pain"". 

Half the ignorant shit I believed about myself, how I didn't deserve so and so, was cleared up by reading comments like these, and when I've seen others make self-deprecating comments I've taken my time to validate them and explain how I felt that way once but here's why it's wrong. Hopefully that person went on to do the same. Just my opinion, I believe it's a very positive thing overall.
👏👏👏
We need to make space for people to express the real emotions of doubt and confusion that come with gender discovery. Such a space did not exist for a very long time (my entire lifetime until maybe 5 years ago, for example), and that forced many generations of people into the closet and into isolation. Suggesting that it is harmful to others to express your true emotions if they are not positive recedes that space, and if this is the only space someone has it shrinks their ability to get the support they need.
I understand all this, and agree, but I think it's fair to say that not very many of us are brimming with self belief.
I want to apologize for the times I have made self-deprecating comments then. Honestly, being told constantly that I look like a man or I don't look feminine at all has just always gotten to me, and it's hurt to the point of making me feel like I'm not good enough to be nonbinary. But you're totally right in that I should be upset at the people who have set those standards for me. I wish society didn't set such harsh gender standards on individuals who don't identify as their AGAB.
Very well said 👏👏👏
*This.*

I’ve been thinking this for awhile, so thank you for putting words to it.
This this this this!!! I’ve felt like I should leave this sub so many times because of the posts you describe, like it can really make me feel uncomfortable and sometimes annoyed when people ask things like “am I too ugly to be this or that” yknow? Coz I know people are insecure, so am I, but implying you have to be conventionally attractive or androgynous in order to be non-binary is a rough thing to see. I’ve fought to be happy how I am coz I’m non-binary no matter what, how you look and present doesn’t change your gender.
I'm really sorry, and will delete my posts accordingly.
👏!!!!!
I think a lot of people making posts like these are confused/scared, or perhaps young.  It's hard to think about how your words affect others when they've merely been part of a train of thought that's been chasing you off the rails for months/years.

But yes, everything you said is true.
This.
Many of us don't have other safe places to express our insecurities, so it's important to be able to do that
I’ll probs get hate for this but I stand by it. This starts because of the obsession with labels. Just be you fuck what others think. I know it’s easier said then done and it took me till I was 23 to properly do so but if you take small steps I can guarantee that realising that only you define you and no one or any label can is hella liberating.
Good post!
Yes
I personally read trans as ""I identify more strongly with the things typically ASSOCIATED with the opposite binary gender of my agab then I do being neutral, bigender, or my agab enough to CONSIDER physically altering my body to match it"". That doesn't fit me but it does fit better with my new nonbinary thinking I've been working on and the trans woman I know that doesn't want to physically transition because she is just not okay with being chemical dependent on hrt and as result last I heard wasn't on hrt.
all of this. i feel so dysphoric when i see posts that focus on agab when agab is completely irrelevant. i wonder if the mods could include a flair for internalized transphobia or something like that? or if there could be a reminder to acknowledge that internalized transphobia/fatphobia/etc is at play???
You make such good points too! Is it possible to feel like I totally agree with you AND OP at the same time? because I do. That’s what makes this whole conversation so interesting, and how nuanced our collective experiences of discovering our nonbinary-ness are.
This
i agree with you, but i don't think you're really contradicting the op, either. i think the point isn't to shut down discussions of doubt and confusion, but to frame doubt and confusion as emotions rather than as facts (maybe not the right word?). for example, instead of saying, ""am i too ugly to be nonbinary?"" one could say, ""i feel too ugly to be nonbinary and i feel invalid because xyz"" and directly ask for reassurance and/or discussion of the societal forces that drive these kinds of insecurities in nonbinary spaces. if that makes sense??? like i definitely want folks to be able to talk about their fears/insecurities etc without actively perpetuating them within the community. i guess it's a fine line, tho, so it does have to be ok on some level for folks to walk it less than perfectly
i think it's also ok to just feel invalid or whatever and straight up ask for reassurance? like for reals, if i see you posting that you're struggling with some internalized enbyphobia or whatever, imma hop in and remind you that you're nonbinary af, you're fantastic, and you make this sub even more awesome than it already was. cuz it's true!
I just want to say I really appreciated your post about gender essentialism, it gave me a lot to think about. Please don't delete it!
I mean that’s ok with how you read it but trans is literally identifying as a gender other than the one you are assigned with birth. It’s fine if it is a label that you don’t want to claim but that’s what it is 🤷
As a transfeminine nonbinary person (trying to find a label -- agender woman?  rofl, who knows or cares!), the ""trans"" label is somewhat difficult for me.  Yeah, I'm on HRT.  But as someone who isn't very feminine at all, I do feel more attached to the ""nonbinary"" label.  I describe myself as ""trans"" to cis people, because it seems to communicate a lot and they can't understand simple gender concepts without their brains overheating.  In the end, to me, labels are about creating a set of expectations for whoever I'm talking to.

I'm not a transmedicalist at all (dysphoria is *certainly* not required to be trans), but the primary motivating factor in me describing myself as ""trans"" and ""woman"" rather than just ""nonbinary"" is the treatment I've received for dysphoria and society's expectations that all lesbians are binary women (and I'm definitely a lesbian).

It's all a big frustrating word game anyway and I commend everyone who hasn't been tricked into playing!
Haha yeah it's just a discussion. I see where OP is coming from. They are coming from a real place and I think it's valid to agree with both of us at some level. It's not like I totally disagree with OP, just feel differently about some aspects.
Thank you so much. This is so sweet. I get afraid of being annoying asking for reassurance, and sometimes I feel ignored when I do ask for reassurance. But I'm glad you're so supportive. Thank you again. :')
I guess it's shifted to that because that fits me being trans neutral, I honestly don't care about sticking with my ""dead gender"" at all anymore, so yours fits better now. 😂
Yah I just had the I guess I'm trans neutral realization so mood. I have what would be called gynecomastia so I guess I already got what I would have taken hrt for so guess that's a thing.
Dang I started developing breast tissue at around 13 before testosterone did me dirty (never got diagnosed with anything though).  I wonder how common that is?
Idk, maybe ask a doctor, I figure mine was related to high Adderall doses I was on but all I really know for sure about it is I still have my tits at 25, about 10% of the majority of case that start in puberty don't go away last I looked at statistics."	qo1leo	NonBinary	611	0.97	2021-11-06 14:39:15
this message is so important. gender dysphoria is real!		"Actually, I can't escape womanhood because people like you f*cking insist on categorizing me as a woman against my will, Karen.
But see, I never asked to be a woman. I never really wanted to be a woman. Yet here society is, telling me that I am what I neither asked nor wanted to be.
I'm so tired of cis women saying this. Yes now I've added misogynony and being infantilised by both cis men and cis women. Now, I get to hear cis women snickering or whispering 'I told you so' every time something sexist happens to me while they heap on the misgendering. Ugh...
the only choice is choosing to make the steps toward living an authentic life and finally finding comfort and happiness in your own skin instead of succumbing to the toxic societal expectations of womanhood and binary gender.
Dysphoria is real but not all trans or non binary people have dysphoria sometimes euphoria is a better way to tell. It is not a choice though.
I love them! They're autistic like me too :)
Terfs don't understand the difference between pain caused by being forced I to a gender that you aren't and the pain caused by being discriminated for the gender that you are.
I aint no woman. I aint no man. I'm human, and that's the shit that counts.
Yes Karen that is true FOR YOU because you identify as a AFAB cis woman.  THAT IS NOT ME.
Wtf
It's usually not a choice, but I do know someone who chooses to change their gender all the time.
My gender euphoria has me questioning my identity at 27. Never to late I supose.
Isn’t  gender dysphoria sexist? Bc claiming that u feel like u are x  gender only works if u think that x gender has x attributes.  isn’t that sexist ? They also say that they are born in the wrong body but then they say sex and gender don’t go together. So how does that work ? Having Dysphoria is sexist.  How can people fight for transgender rights and etc but then also fight for women rights and etc. how can one support both ?
Well they could be genderfluid, or they're still questioning and trying out different things to see if they like it
They've been doing this for years, I don't think they'd disagree that they're genderfluid, but they're adament they have agency over it and I'm going to believe them on that.

It's important that we don't let these sort of tactical arguments that apply to most queer people be used as rigid rules within the community. Yes ""born this way"" is a great way to get non queer sympathy, and that sympathy is important for us to win legal rights and protection, but it isn't strictly true for everyone."	m9hibu	NonBinary	608	0.99	2021-03-20 22:11:20
I want to be feminine, but it makes some people uncomfortable.	"I found alot of comments in transgender subreddits,
alot of the post comments or posts in those reddits say they avoid nb people who are feminine or masculine because:
-They get dysphoria
-Don't wanna be seen as gay or straight
-Believe nb people should look androgynous or they're fake cause they're not putting in effort to be labeled correctly. 
It makes me feel a bit sad cause I'm a feminine nb and I don't wanna make someone uncomfortable cause I'm causing dysphoria or making them look fake.. Its making me second guess my identity, I don't wanna make trans people uncomfortable or embarrased."	"Nah that person's just transphobic
Non-binary people can present in any way they're comfortable with, just like any other gender identity, because presentation doesn't define gender, and gender doesn't define presentation.

If a person experiences distressing thoughts and feelings based on seeing you, that's *their* problem, not yours. We are each responsible for our own thoughts and feelings and reactions. If I can *cause* someone to experience dysphoria, that takes away their agency. That means they will be forever at the whims of whoever walks past them for whether they feel happy and valid or not. That's not healthy.

Let's look at a similar case. A woman dresses a particular way to a party. She is sexually assaulted. The perpetrator of that heinous crime doesn't get to say ""she shouldn't have dressed that way if she didn't want to be assaulted."" That's an obviously fallacious argument people make in an effort to try to shift responsibilty for their actions or feelings onto someone else. It doesn't fly with blaming clothing for sexual assault, and it doesn't fly blaming non-binary people for a binary trans person experiencing dysphoria. We call the former victim blaming, and we call the latter trans/enbyphobia. They're the same wrong premise, and both of them should be rejected.

You are valid just the way you are, and interacting with you brings me euphoria. I love seeing the wide variety of ways that non-binary people can express themselves. If you want to dictate someone else's feelings to them, please dictate euphoria in my direction as much as you can by continuing to be awesome.

Edit: please don't give this awards or whatever. I'm flattered, but reddit doesn't need your money. Please donate to the trans lifeline or the trevor project if you can.
tbh someone's dysphoria shouldn't control how YOU express yourself to begin with,,
like yeah they can't control feeling dysphoric and im sorry that gets triggered in some folks but if they're coming onto other people and telling them what to do that's just messed up-
like have they ever considered they could be making someone ELSE dysphoric by doing that? or just straight up invalidating people, like you for instance. It's NOT your fault 

like honestly they should avoid non-binary spaces entirely if they genuinely can't deal w ppl who aren't androgynous and it hurts them THAT much, it gets to a point where you need to take care of yourself- 

bc sure as hell nobody else will be changing their whole body and presentation for them 💀

If they think non-binary ppl can only look ONE way then they already lost the meaning-
like hello?? you can't be putting it into another restrictive box. There's sm non-binary genders and experiences, you CAN'T just slap androgyny on everything.

Be yourself, don't turn away from something that's important to you over someone else's discomfort or even internalized transphobia. It's NOT okay that theyre lashing out or telling people they aren't ""putting in the effort"".
That mindset they are holding is literally so transphobic and toxic. Those under the non binary umbrella do not owe anyone androgyny. Androgyny is not the definition of non binary just like be masculine and feminine don’t decide whether someone is inherently a man or a woman. Do you and wear whatever you want.
It just sounds like transphobia / enbyphobia to me. We come in more types than just 100% androgynous. Anyone who has an issue with it should just get over it, I think.
You dress how you want, your gender identity doesn't equal how femme, masc, or nuetral you are.

If others are being mean to you for being yourself then try to stand up.  I know it's hard to stand up but those people are being transphobic (even if they're trans) and aren't respecting you.

If it really does give them dysphoria then talk to them about it and see how you can both be happy in a situation like that.

I know alot of FTM trans people who love being feminine and wearing dresses and other stuff.  As well as MTF people who don't enjoy being feminine.  How you dress doesn't make you any less NB than anybody else.

I'm Non-binary but I ""act more genderfluid"" because I dress masc, femme, nuetral, and a mix of both depending on how I feel.  (I used to identify as genderfluid but found that I only like they/them and it's my fashion that changes depending on my confidence)


TL;DR : how you dress doesn't mean you're any less NB than any other NB
They’re being transphobic. They have a similar mentality as many cis ppl, the mentality about the binary, so they’re trying to put non-binary people into a third binary when that’s not what being non-binary is about

Do what you want. Do what makes you feel good, and avoid those types of people. Gender identity matters less when it comes to transphobia, anybody can be transphobic in different ways
Other people just existing can't cause dysphoria that's just controlling af. I'm a femme nb too and there's nothing wrong with being femme or masc, presentation isn't gender
Screw them. Be happy being who you are. Your priority in life is you and not worrying about how people might be uncomfortable because of their own issues. You be you 🤛
Honestly that’s such a stupid argument. What, you’re (general) a trans man and you get dysphoric when you see a trans woman? That’s fucking gross? Why’s it different for nonbinary people? There’s no one way to be nonbinary (or to be binary trans either ok) and so you being feminine IS a part of your gender. That’d be like you going up to a trans guy and going “you’re masculine and that gives me dysphoria bc I’m feminine, can you stop?” Like that’s crazy. I’m sorry you see that stuff
Sadly there are a lot of transphobic trans people...

They are not right, you can look how ever you want. We don't owe anyone androgyny.
And them getting dysphoria of you or others is not your problem, it's their own because this is something we can't look after. Your freedom and rights weigh the same as theirs.
If having a style you enjoy ""makes someone uncomfortable"". Let them be uncomfortable, you don't owe people androgeny. Anyone can be feminine regardless of gender.
Not conforming to an idea is the expression of non binary imo. It means I’m gonna go for what makes me comfortable and happy without an idea of what I “should” be looking like.
Yo, do whatever the fuck you want. It's not your job to make other people feel comfortable, it's your job to make you feel comfortable. Anybody who looks at someone else and is uncomfortable by it, it's their job to either ignore it or look at themselves and see why they're being a bigoted asshole. Doesn't matter who they are. Trans. Cis. Straight. Gay. Bi. Progressive. Conservative. Etc. Etc. Do what YOU want.
Enby people come in all shapes and sizes.

I present feminine in society eyes but personally I think I give off more neutral vibe.

If 1 word cannot define all people in a gender, then why should an enby present a certain way.

Never doubt yourself bb ❤
You can't control other people's thoughts. Present how you want
>They get dysphoria

That's frankly not your problem. Some people get dysphoria from seeing their deadname. Doesn't mean they can forbid anyone with that name to use it any more. If you're a femby, that's who you are.

>Believe nb people should look androgynous

We don't owe androgyny to anyone. Clothes and style aren't inherently gendered, it's just shit we made up. If men can enjoy wearing frilly dresses, so can enbies.

>they're not putting in effort to be labeled correctly.

That's just transmedicalist bs. If you're fine with being mislabelled, it must mean you're not dysphoric, which means you're not trans/enby. It's gatekeeping, nothing else.

>I don't wanna make someone uncomfortable

You'll always make someone uncomfortable over benign stuff. Doesn't mean you have to give them control over you. Someone will always want you to be different. But it's an unreasonable demand. If you give someone dysphoria just by existing, it can't be helped. Some *other* trans person will feel dysphoric over your most androgynous look. It just happens. But you can't turn invisible.

Plenty of trans people will have 0 issues with you doing your thing. I know my friends would, bc they've always been supportive of me, and I'm pretty femby myself.
[deleted]
You’re valid no matter what you wear ❤️ Clothes/aesthetics have no gender
[deleted]
Making other people comfortable with your presentation isn't your job (with a few obvious exceptions). Your presentation is to satisfy your own feelings about gender, not to kowtow to archaic and transphobic attitudes. And even fellow queers—even fellow *enbys*—can be transphobic, sometimes without even realizing it.

It is impossible to prevent oneself from making other people uncomfortable, regardless of what you do, regardless of what it relates to. Reconciling with this fact is one of the key lessons of maturity.

If the people you are concerned about are your friends, ask them openly how they feel. If they're truly your friends, they'll try to work with you on the issue. If they're random people on the Internet, fuck 'em (metaphorically). Their part in your life is insignificant unless you make it significant.

Unless you have reason to believe that your preferred presentation would put you in danger or at great financial disadvantage, you can generally not worry about how other people react. It's not their life to live.
I'm an androgenous enby with a lot of dysphoria, and I'm here to say: no matter how you present, what pronouns you use (including exclusively using he/him or exclusively she/her or exclusively using neos), how much dysphoria or lack thereof you have, and what other people think - you are valid and whoever doesn't like it has to deal with their own feelings
Hi! This is called internalized transmisogyny, they're projecting their own dysphoria on you, and how other people have made them feel at other times in their lives. Also no one gets to police anyone else's gender, that's the whole point of gender identity. You are valid however you feel comfortable. I hope this helps. 💕
there seems to be an uptick in enby-phobia lately i wonder what 4chan operation is going on?
I don’t give a fuck if my enbyness makes *anyone* uncomfortable.  Sure, if I’m being an asshole, by all means, tell me; the last thing I actually want to do is make people uncomfortable.  That said, however I present is MY business, not theirs, and if me looking feminine or masculine bothers them, they can eff right off.  I hope you can appreciate how important it is to dress and present the way *you* want to.  So yeah, mute that noise and do what makes you feel good, not strive to avoid making someone uncomfortable with your presentation.
You don’t want to be feminine, you *are* such a beautiful feminine individual that identifies nb and living your true colors, loving every aspect of it, will make YOU comfortable. And that’s all it matters. Fuck everyone else. Sending fem hugs to you! 🏳️‍⚧️
Fuck that.

You want to express your gender in a feminine way, fuck anyone else that gets uncomfortable by that. It's not your fault nor your problem. Especially if they set these dumb ass rules up and expect each and every person to be like ""Oh you know what, that actually makes sense."" 

In my opinion, and you can decide to do what ever you want. But I say express yourself however you want, be safe & stop letting these randoms that would throw you under the bus in a heart beat dictate how you feel on a day to day bases.
It's not your responsibility to deal with other people's internalized transphobia. You could present as masculine or as feminine as you want, and you still deserve to be treated with respect and not be misgendered. Even trans people are capable of being wrong, and it sounds like you ran into some truscummy types. They don't get to tell you how to present, nobody does. You are allowed to do what makes YOU most comfortable. Don't center other people's feelings in your gender identity
Dont listen to truscum, just keep on being you :)
What is it with like some members of the binary trans community being all truscum about nbs. I get theres like a phenomenon where they're kind of projecting their insecurities trying to cope but like tearing other people down is so unintuitive. We're all in this struggle together smh
Trans people can be transphobic. Black people can be racist. Gay people can be homophobic. 

Discrimination knows no boundaries, but if you want to counteract that, be the change you want to see.
Feminine enby here :3

I love going out wearing my dresses or skirts and doing my make up a little ( I am not good at it) 

No one can tell me to fuck of about my gender ^ ^
Fuck them. They need to work on their own internalised transphobia, not try to shame other people for how they present!
Dysphoria is an involuntary response, like as a transfem person I sometimes feel dysphoria looking at other people: either because they look like I want to look or because they remind me of myself in a bad way. However, that's not your problem! I don't choose what I have dysphoria over and sometimes that is annoying *for me* but I get through it and it doesn't impact my ability to befriend people who give me this feeling.
Don't listen to these people - be your amazing feminine nb self, and don't care about people who're not okay with this. If these people gatekeep your identity based on your presentation, I feel like they themselves don't have much of an idea of what identity means. Non-binary doesn't imply androgynous, and androgynous doesn't imply non-binary either!
 who tf cares, you can dress/present yourself however you want, if someone has a problem with it, that’s not a person worth your time
fuck the other people, you present how you would like to, if they’re uncomfortable then that’s their own problem
Binary trans people who put down nonbinary trans people are transphobic. This is one of those ways that trans people can be transphobic. 

Also if someone is dysphoric around me because my gender shifts around between ""she/her but in a drag way"" and ""he/him but in a lesbian way"" (im nonbinary fluid) then that is on them to unpack. I am not going to sanitize myself for other trans people??? Thats the same thing that cis people demand of them and of us, sanitizing their identity for respectability politics. They just have it easier than GNC folk, even binary people have the right to present outside of gender norms

Edit: typo and phrasing
You should do whatever makes you happy. If someone tells you that you’re causing them dysphoria, then that’s something they need to work out, and stop hating on non-binary people. Non-binary literally means not being part of the binary, so you are free to present however you feel comfortable. Don’t let anybody take that away from you, okay? Don’t surround yourself with people like that, because not every lgbtq+ person is nice.
You do not owe anyone androgyny. I'm AFAB and often femme presenting, I'm still nonbinary.
their bullshit is not more important than your truth. if you feel limited in your expression by others in the lgbtq community you havent failed us - we have failed you. do whatever the hell you want
Women don’t have to be femme, men don’t have to be masc, we don’t have to be andro.

Widening gender freedom helps ALL trans people, binary or not
No that’s genuinely non-binary-phobia at work. You have the right to express however the fuck you feel. Be feminine, be masculine, whatever works for you. You don’t need to conform yourself to others views of gender.
Just say fuck them and be who you want to be
Sometimes you gotta do you, other people may be uncomfortable (regardless of where they reside on hetero/queer/nonbinary-ness) to just be you, be happy with you and do you, sometimes we have to stop wprrying what others thing and care more about what we ourselves think about ourselves.
Just jumping in quickly to state that “nb” actually stands for “non-black” and should be reserved for those in our BIPOC communities for those who it is relevant to, rather than nonbinary communities. 

Some available alternatives are; enby and nBi 😊 
Not having a go at anyone, just trying to help educate and raise awareness as a fellow enby 😊 

Also OP, fuck what other people think, at the end of the day it’s your body and it’s your choice. Nonbinary doesn’t have any one single “look”, fuck anyone who says otherwise. You wanna be feminine? Well then babe go get it, be the most gorgeous person out there, you are still 100% valid. You got this xx
[removed]
Look up Kate Bornstein she was a femme presenting non-binary person before most of us were conceived. Such an inspiration!
Be how you want to be
Do whatever the help you want,  the opinions of people on the internet don't matter unless you let them matter
I thought you were going to say transphobes were uncomfortable. There is some difference between what you are actually talking about, but not as much as those NBphobes would probably like to imagine.
Their thinking is garbage and seems extremely shallow.  I wouldn't want to be around people who had such feelings, so we could mutually avoid each other.  It sounds like they have small minds lol

I can go from masculine to feminine and back again several times through the day/week/year.  It's taken me so long to be okay with my fluidity, I'm not about to shut down parts of me for some random person I don't even know.  If it makes them that uncomfortable, they can look away.  We all have a right to exist as ourselves, and express our gender however makes us feel most comfortable.

I used to be afraid to look ""too"" feminine or masculine when going out.  I didn't want attention either way.  Random people out in the world don't know I'm non-binary, but I get very different reactions from others based on how I'm presenting that day.  I fear being oggled and sexualized if I dress too feminine, and appearing obviously genderqueer in hostile situations if I dress masculine enough.  I'm starting to realize that it's not my responsibility if other people have a reaction to me.  I still try to be safe, and will dress more neutrally if I'm going into a place that I think is going to be dangerous, but I've started to let myself just exist and take up more space when dressing for work or just going about my life, for instance.

No one has any valid reason to go around policing someone's gender identity or expression, and it's inherently sexist and transphobic to do so.  How would these people feel if someone else made up arbitrary, nonsensical rules about how they could present?  It's also not our job to convince anyone else that we're not ""fake"".  Being masculine or feminine doesn't determine your gender identity, and it's 100% valid to be feminine non-binary, regardless of your agab.
i feel the same way. i’m non-binary and i’m also afab and i feel like i’m constantly being sexualized whenever i try and embrace femininity. i’m also MORTIFIED of making anyone uncomfortable.

i think it’s important to remember that femininity doesn’t rely on your genitalia! i love being feminine!!! and i love mainly presenting masculine too. you’re so so sooooo valid. it’s hard to remember that sometimes. you’re beautiful even if you don’t think so!!! don’t feel embarrassed because you’re not alone! trans include non-binary people too.
You do you and don't let anyone else's opinions affect you
I am nonbinary. I also wear dresses and makeup and have long hair. Those two things can and do coexist. You are no less nonbinary if you dress masc or fem than if you dress andro. The way you dress or present yourself has absolutely nothing to do with your gender identity even though most people think it does. A straight cis man can wear a dress and still be straight and cis right? You can dress feminine and still be nonbinary. Anyone who believes otherwise is wrong. If you wanna talk about this more feel free to message me. Never stop being who you are ❤️
okay and? you’re gonna let people depict your happiness? fuck them.
If they are also being rough on anyone mtf then those are terfs, just mute those people they aren't worth dealing with.
You present yourself how you want to. Don't care what others think of you. You do what makes you happy. If presenting fem makes you happy present fem. If presenting masc makes you happy, present masc. Those other people saying that if your nb you have to present androgynous, are just being transphobic jerks, (even if they are trans themselves).
You don't owe anyone androgyny
It's such a shame that people who go through so much difficulty and hostility turn it on each other so often. We need to support one another!
Remember there no one/proper way to be non-binary. There is no specific look you have to have.
Sorry I believe I wrote it wrong, its multiple people who are trans.
This is a beautiful response.

Nothing I can say will top this.
AGREED
>so they’re trying to put non-binary people into a third binary when that’s not what being non-binary is about

It's rather ironic how the same community that is so opposed to being forced into a gender binary turns around and imposes their own gender binary of cis/trans upon all people. And anyone that attempts to opt out of that binary, or dares to question its efficacy, will face harsh ridicule and mockery. Last month I even had a nonbinary person come into my subreddit and tell me (very condescendingly) that I should just accept being ""cis"" gender nonconforming right on a post where I expressly disavowed being called ""cis"".
And as for that last sentence, “I don’t wanna make trans people uncomfortable or embarrassed” I don’t know your relationship with your gender, but. Nonbinary people ARE trans people. So why should you, a trans person, make yourself uncomfortable just for the comfort of another trans person who is being gross and judgemental?
Yep!!! Personal boundaries are important.
Lunarian, yay!  I'm so happy to see someone using the galactian alignments system in conversation.

The system resonates with me, too.  I think I'm probably eclipsian or galaxian.  I would feel very constrained and uncomfortable limiting myself to pure androgyny at all times.
Don't use that word except to refer to yourself.
 If a gay man doesn't like lesbians because they're lesbains, it makes them homophobic. If a trans person doesn't like another trans person because they aren't ""looking"" the part, they are being transphobic.
Transphobia can occur even within transgender circles, friend.
being trans and being transphobic are not mutually exclusive :)
I was deadnamed and misgendered by a binary trans woman. I'm a transfemme nonbinary woman. If anyone thinks I'm doing my gender wrong, I try my best to not take it personally. They are either a transphobe, a misogynist, or both.
You looking like yourself isn't supposed to cause any dysphoria as it is your body. You're not fake, I'm a transmasc enby but I still dress feminine a lot because I like it. Looks =/= gender
My friend, it seems like you stumbled upon truscums. They're a subset in the trans & non-binary community (although sometimes the cis join them) that basically dedicate themselves to enforce a closed, outdated and rigid definition of what being ""truly"" trans is.

Some of them don't even acknowledge the existence of enby folks, whereas others accept us but tell us shite like that, that we need to achieve androgyny in order to be ""truly"" enbies...

Bullshit, all of it. If you feel great being feminine, I say become fucking Aphrodite if you want! They aren't entitled to dictate how \*you\* should feel and present. You're the only one whose opinion matters here, since \*you\* are the one living in your own skin.

Besides, their claims are nonsensical. Dysphoria doesn't work like that??? How the hell do you get dysphoric at ""masc or fem presenting enbies""??? Doesn't make any sense, they're straight up lying.

Being fem is absolutely harmless. If they get uncomfortable at it, it's a \*them\* issue, not yours. I encourage you to follow what makes you feel full and dismiss ill-intentioned claims such as these.
It’s just outright hypocritical. I support whatever gender ppl identity as, I support you for being gender noncomforming(although tbh I don’t fully understand that, I’m still learning things)

What ppl identity with has no effect on me, and I see no reason to put others down for it

It’s like they only expect cis ppl to not be transphobic, they don’t hold themselves to the same standards
[deleted]
No better example of that than Caitlin Jenner
>enforce a closed, outdated and rigid definition of what being ""truly"" trans is.

That's not true at all. It is actually the reverse. The *new* definition of ""trans"" is what is closed and rigid since it only allows for people that claim a ""gender identity"" to be part of the community. Transgender was originally conceived in the 1990s as a broadly inclusive umbrella for anyone that was marginalized for breaking the social rules of gender regardless of identity or expression whether it be drag queens, crossdressers, transsexuals, genderqueers, butches, femmes, etc.
Of course non trasphobia is achievable. You wouldn't say no one is truly not misogynistic just because certain women push a patriarchal view of femininity or something. Doesn't make sense.
bro literally the only other posts in your history are questioning the validity of nonbinary identities and you want to come in here arguing about what defines ""true transphobia"" lmfao
Truscums aren't exactly a new thing so it's still outdated. You deliver a great point, though, by pointing out what it was defined like at the beggining :)
[deleted]
Keep in mind that Trans-medicalists also don't represent the broad consensus of the trans community. They are a fringe group, not unlike the relationship of TERFs to feminism. The definition they cite isn't confirmed by any major medical journals, encyclopedias, or other reputable sources.
You’re literally just typing words to type them. None of this makes any sense. Hot garbage.
Ehm circumcision deff aint pointless i needed to get that done when i was 3 because of medical reasons (that i dont remember i was 3 xD)
I understand your sentiment. It's really a fight of nomenclatures here. Provides no one anything.
[deleted]
I think it really depends on context. Circumcision for medical reasons, such as the example you gave, are generally fine and understandable. Circumcising a baby that just came out of the womb on the other hand, not so understandable and, to put it mildly, pointless. At least that's how I view and understand it.
How is it stretching the definition? If you're saying a trans person can't present a certain way because of how you personally understand their identity, that is transphobic, because they understand their own identity better than anybody and it's literally none of your business. Prejudice targeted against trans people and their identity is the very definition of transphobia. 


It just sounds like you don't really understand nonbinary identity all that well, which, given that you made a post on r/tooafraidtoask wondering what is even is, doesn't really surprise me.
Really feels like you’ve missed the point so I’m not trying to be rude I just wanna spell it out plainly that a feminine non-binary person existing is neither rude or transphobic. But if you’ve got a problem with any non-binary person existing & presenting as themselves, or if you try to make their identity about you, then that’s pretty much rude AND transphobic. Whether it’s said by a cis person or trans person. Live and let live right?
Yeah, there are a lot of factors worth considering for *any* infant surgery. Pediatricians used to think [circumcision](https://www.ghspjournal.org/content/5/1/15) [prevented cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10699138/), but newer research suggests that [other variables may make the difference ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1758146/pdf/v074p00368.pdf). Basically, circumcision might be like[ tonsillectomies](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C28&q=tonsillectomies+overused&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DuMuK5eP40eYJ), which are really beneficial in some cases but were overused for awhile.

Either way, the whole topic tends to be a magnet for antisemites 😅
[deleted]
Oh yeah, I mean it's not a topic I'm hugely familiar with in the first place, but I can imagine how many antisemites and reactionary chuds flock to it the way middle aged British white women flock to a Simply Red concert.
OK. What labels are you referring to specifically that seem unnecessary to you?
[deleted]
Transphobic isn't a label, though. It's a descriptor, more than anything. Also, no offense, but you don't get to decide what is and isn't offensive to a particular group of people. If they say it's offensive (or in this case, transphobic) to them, then it is. I really don't get why you're arguing this. /gen /nm
[deleted]
Does it matter? Either way, it's not a contest to see who's the most/least upset at something. The important thing is to actually listen to people and understand why they (be it on an individual or collective level) find certain things upsetting in the first place, instead of holding these rather pointless discussions about where we ""draw the line"". Again, if you're not part of a particular community, you don't get to say what is and isn't offensive to said community. /gen /mn"	qrw8m4	NonBinary	600	1.0	2021-11-11 22:03:30
Just had a late halloween party with friends and this was my last minute costume. I guess this is my new anti-dysphoria suit now lol		"Because of COVID, this is a perfect time to wear that costume.
no gender only plague doctor
Them: are you boy or girl

Me: I am plague doctor

Them: but... What's in your pants???

Me: Herbs and shit
Yes!!! I was a plague doctor for Halloween this year, and the best part was people constantly confused about what my gender could possibly be. Very fun.
nobody messes with the plague doctor
That is also what I wore for Halloween really helps with dysphoria actually though
r/voidpunk
Cool Halloween costume. Did you get a certain kind of beer wearing your costume
I hope it made you feel like a badass cuz this is so cool!!
You see this is really funny because this is exactly my costume except over the hood I had a top hat
I have that same costume I got a few halloweens back and I do use it as a anti dysphoria outfit lol
Honestly, if I had money to spare I would ABSOLUTELY go buy one of these. Plague doctor aesthetic is something else

Non binary or enby works fine
I've honestly only ever seen it written as trans femme and when spoken they both sound the same. Semantics

You do you boo. I'm gonna keep using transfemme because it fits and lesbians don't use 'trans'femme, just femme. Femme was also first used, in English I imagine, in 1814 to describe women, femme is French for woman, lots of queers use femme to describe themselves. Usage defines language and language is constantly evolving.

Ok, so I'm gonna take quotes from the Wikipedia page you shared with me.

""Femme is a lesbian identity that was created in the working class lesbian bar culture of the 1950s. It is a term used to distinguish feminine lesbian and bisexual women from their butch/masculine lesbian counterparts and partners.""
""In addition, it can be used to self-describe queer femininity for persons of any gender.""
""Lesbian feminism saw a rejection of the butch-femme dynamic and therefore femme identity.""
""In 1994 Kate Bornstein chronicled their experience as a gender non-conforming person who is a femme lesbian in their book Gender Outlaw.[9] Praising the publication of Ivan Coyote’s Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme in 2011 they said “The butch/femme dynamic is a conscious, loving binary of desire and trust … it’s a dance of love and outlawed romance. Butches and femmes share a sense of tribe, extended family and kinship—no matter what our genders might be”.""
""Since the late 2010s, influenced by the emergence of queer and transgender culture on sites such as Tumblr, Everyday Feminism and Autostraddle, femme has been expanded to describe feminine people across gender and sexuality categories including heterosexual women, cisgender men and transfeminine people.[11][12][13][14] The postmodern queer conception of femme is a femme-identified person who does not always dress or act in a ""traditionally feminine"" (meaning a feminine aesthetic, such as wearing makeup, heels, and numerous accessories) way, but who expresses femme identity through feminine-associated behaviours, interactions and political views.""
""Rather than an erotic identity rooted in lesbian women's culture, queer femme has been reframed into a political identity that is inclusive of all who wish to identify with it, feminine-presenting or not.""
""Based on the understanding of ""femme"" as describing a person (not necessarily a woman) who presents femininely, the expression ""women and femmes"" is sometimes used, but it has been criticized as conflating two different categories of identity.""
""Femme has also been used to describe a form of contemporary feminism which rejects the gender binary and acknowledges that individuals can fall anywhere within the gender spectrum, resulting in the possibility to be gender-less, gender-fluid, femme or masculine of center.""

Again, these are all quotes taken from the Wikipedia page for ""Femme"" that you shared. It seems like you're the only one gatekeeping this term..."	f5je29	NonBinary	562	1.0	2020-02-18 01:14:00
Bought my very first dress, and I can just feel the dysphoria shedding away		"I want this to be Facebook so I can hit the love react
That is a totally awesome dress.  I also love your choker necklace.  You have a great sense of fashion.
Good on you! 
One thing I have to say though, and I'm sorry ahead of time if this is a rude thing to say, but if your hair is naturally curly, let it be curly. If not then you gotta get some argan oil and add that when you're conditioning your hair.

(advice from someone with long hair)
You look gorgeous ❤️
You look lovely cute dress. Dresses are the cutest. How do you like wearing dresses?

YOU LOOK AMAZING!!! Great job at standing up to your fears (if they existed, i'm going off of personal experience '\^-\^)!!! Do you want me to use she/her pronouns or they/them or she/her/they/them or...? 'Cuz you seem to be a great person that also seems like you would be a great friend, and I kinda want to get to know you!
Ya looking great
You look so beautiful, sis! And more importantly, you look really happy. ♥️♥️♥️
It looks amazing on you!!!

Your style is on point! Such a great looking photo!
you chose such a pretty dress, you look gorgeous in it!!
You look perfect. Werk it!
❤
My hair isn't actually curly, it was just messy from pulling on and off about four different dresses over my head.
Thank you!
It's absolutely fabulous. It feels so snug yet flowy and freeing in a way. I can't wait to get more and wear them regularly.
Thank you! Most of my fears stemmed from coming out to my ex in-laws. I felt caged, in a way. This past week has really been a road of self-discovery. I have never felt so confident before.

I use she/her/they/them pronouns.
That would make a lot of sense lol

You've heard of dysphoria hoodie, now get ready for dysphoria dungarees! Straight lines, loose fit, evening out every bit of curve		"I loved dungarees as a child
Can confirm! my nb partner and I recently spent a good 20 mins looking at overalls online and shouting ""why don't we own these??""
Yes I love dungarees! They're gender neutral, and they look great on literally everyone!
gotta love a good pair of overalls!
Yay for more dungaree love!! Think my dungarees are possibly my favourite item of clothing at the moment! 😃
Cute! What brand are these? I wanna guess Lucy & Yak
Before I bought any dresses, I went thru an overalls phase. They’re all my favorite now.
Me wearing the dungers and becoming the hottest enby transbian the world has ever seen
Uggh I love overalls SO MUCH and I need to find a pair again. I used to have a pair of olive green loose cut off at the knees and they made me feel like a (albeit giant at 6') hobbit. 🥰
Yep. This why I have four for just this reason. Works like a charm most of the time.
OMFG YAAAAAAS I LOVE DUNGAREES
Yes! More dungarees to the people 🤩
God i love overalls/dungarees, i really want to get some dickies ones bc theyre just pure gender euphoria
always worried about them showing my backside a bit.. do they do that? if not.. I think I'm gonna have a new phase of clothing! xD
Got some very tight blue crushed velvet overalls at the thrift store the other day. Couldn’t be a more opposite vibe. Love that overalls just have that range
Me too and let me tell you, as an adult they're at least as good, possibly even better!! 😃

tired of gender?		"Sorry I am already a wizard
[deleted]
Hey if your someone who wants to be femme and your bones's difference in length or breadth still gives you dysphoria, you can always trade with a someone who wants a masc version of those bones, and vice versa! Just pop em off, hand em over and recieve your new bones.
 
Non-binary people can just shuffle up a bunch of bones in a big hat with eachother and mix and match.
but i like my meat and neuron soup sloshing around up there

thanks but i'll pass
ughhhhhhhhhhh...yes plz. 😞

i'm so gd tired. i yearn for the simplicity of nothingness
I would kill to be an undead skeleton.
But I like my gender :(
Fuck it I'm just gonna turn into a bodyless spirit
I wonder if this content is suitable for r/voidpunk
The growth plate in my hips is probably entirely ossified by now. I'm still essentially pre-HRT. My bones will be in a masculine shape for at least the next few decades (they may eventually reshape, but certainly not soon). So I'd rather have flesh I can reshape between me and directly perceiving the bones whose shape is more or less fixed.
So how would we tell each other apart? Like one of those ""Hello my name is..."" sticky tags? Imagine the creativity that could be utilized. Like Timmy over here has a rainbow left femur, and Moss has their entire skeleton painted to look like their namesake to be a spy in the skeleton war.
2 genders
Even skeleton is gendered for eg pelvis width and elbow carrying angle
But you could be a skeleton wizard.
I was about to say that I can't imagine how much dysphoria my skeleton would give me
Remove the hips, replace it with magic
I always wanted to be a Lego

The things I'd give to be an afab nonbinary person	I love that I'm trans, in fact I prefer it to be this way. I just hate that I look and sound like a man. I hate the fact that I have a dick. Haven't felt this flavor of dysphoria in a hot minute. Was kind of hoping this had kind of gone away	"I feel like that's the blursed nature of being NB. Cursed: never  being able to match our body with the gender we feel at all times. Blessing: the ability to percieves multiple points of views, feelings, and sensations of multiple genders.
If you were an AFAB nonbinary person you'd probably feel the same way about other things. Breasts, period, maybe height.

I thinks it's always gonna suck, just for different reasons
[deleted]
This is oddly validating because I am in the opposite boat- I've often wondered if I was AMAB if I would still ID as nonbinary. I've always suspected so, and you having the opposite situation just sort of confirms it for me 😅 I feel such a mix of dysphoria around random parts of my physical form, wish we could just swap specific aspects like a character customization screen.
As an AFAB nonbinary person, I also experience dysphoria because I am perceived as a woman. I don't think the grass is much greener over here 

/shrug

I'm sorry that you're feeling dysphoria right now :/
Hell it would be fucking amazing if I was a binary trans person and not have both fem associated and masc associated dysphoria with 1 identity.
AFAB nb trans person here (he/they) and I have so much dysphoria about having breasts and hips and a butt that are very feminine and no matter how much I bind or cut my hair or long I am on T (a year so far) I still get she/her everywhere I go lol
as an afab nonbinary person, i agree with this sort of, but instead of wishing i was mad, i just wish i didn't have any defining sex characteristics at all. i wish i didn't have breasts. i wish i wasn't curvy. i wish i didn't have a period. (that last one isn't really due to dysphoria, more just it being really annoying to deal with)
Being NB, you'd probably just have the opposite issues. I have major chest dysphoria at times.
Mood. It’s like, I finally figure out that I’m trans after living my entire life being genderqueer without knowing it. (Thanks, internalized transphobia). Then after the initial shock wears off, I figure out that … No … I’m not binary trans, because no, that would be too easy. No. I couldn’t *just* be trans. I had to be mtf trans and then reject the expectations of normative binary and swing back into enby. I’m transing at being trans. I’m not genderfluid; I’m genderpretzel. 

Just get this thing off of me, please, and give me my estrogen.
i’m afab and i feel the same way
Im afab nb and i hate some things and love others. 

I legit hate periods and the fact that i could get pregnant. Had to get a breast reduction because i had giant boobs and wanted smaller ones. (Not flat, just enough so i could decide, may need another reduction to get there). I hate afab weight gain and metabolism so its really hard to lose weight. And i hate that my ideal gender presentation has me with long hair so i would be clocked as cis regardless of my jawline/chest. 

The only pro is i like having a fat ass. Wouldnt trade it for anything. My other traits come from genetics, less of being afab. me not looking super feminine. I have a masc hairline and face shape naturally and a naturally lower voice for afabs (alto/tenor). I wouldnt go on T because i really love my voice. I'm also 5'10"". None of the things I like about myself are inherently ""afab things"" but they came with my afab body. 

Sometimes im curious about having a dick because maybe i would like s3x better or something. Or that kind of stuff would be easier for me. But realistically if i had an amab body i feel like i would go on E microdosing and just try to dress like harry styles. There would probably be things i liked  and disliked about amab me too. Taking into consideration my genetics, my fat ass would probably be gone 🤣  

My ideal is somewhere in between afab and amab. I want long hair but a small chest but a fat ass but muscular with a chisled jawline. Im lucky that i dont have to worry about height or voice like some nbs do, but I wanted to share that no afab or amab is a monolith. Theres some things that you do get but a lot of it is genetics.
I do want to remind folx that AFAB nonbinary doesn't always equal looking like a cis woman. I used to be more jealous of AMAB people but medically transitioning helped me deal with alot of that, tbh. I will say that the amount of work that I had to put in to be seen as literally anything other than woman-lite was steep. I'm jealous that AMAB enbies can be seen as genderqueer legitimately without having to go on HRT, bodybuild, and getting top surgery. I'm also jealous of natal penises although having both is nice
As an afab nonbinary person I often wish I was amab
also just throwing in 2 cents to the self ID afabs replying here that not every dysphoric experience is equally mirrored on the other end of things cause society and transmisogyny rly rly suck in ways transmisogyny exempt ppl don’t know sooo… 
but yeah dysphoria sucks and always seems to come back at the worst times. i wish there was a way to become selectively invisible whenever you want for as long as you want and not have to be perceived until you’d like to. oh and that body parts could just like pop off and be traded around to whoever wants them lol. we could all take turns having great butts. start the siblinghood of the traveling ass
if you want chest dysphoria come and take it ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
As an AFAB non-binary, id kill to be AMAB. The things you hate are the things I want. I know this probably won’t help, but that’s where I’m at rn.
I've said this before on this sub, but I really wanna be able to trade out certain body parts with other people. I just wanna be able to hang my tits up in the closet, or be able to switch genitals like I do underwear. Hoping science could somehow make this a reality 😭
Yeah… I know this is a dick thing to say but sometimes it’s hard to look at AFAB nbs because of the jealousy. 

But it’s important to acknowledge that they’re goin through the same shit just the other direction. It’s important to not let the dysphoria get in the way of being kind to everyone.
I know how you feel. I'm genderqueer and love my identity. But getting clocked as a man and having the dysphoria that goes along with my AMAB body is tough.
It's like the meme;


Afab enbies want to be amab enbies, and vice versa. 


The human form is too limiting to have the perfect balance for everyone imo
I'm pretty masc presenting and yeah I do sometimes wish I was born as the other sex. I do like having a pp though so at least I have that going for me lol
Do you find your levels of body dysphoria stay the same or does it change over time? If it's fairly stable, surgery could be a good option for the future. What i find tough is that sometimes I hate my feminibe features, sometimes I would *kill* to have a dick, then other times I'm just not bothered. I don't mind having breasts but I resent that they're a sex identifier for others, but at least binding is an option. Maybe tucking would help in your case, like drag queens do?
I hate my boobs and slump over and am fine with my genitals (but I hate periods). If I could choose what I was born as, it'd definitely be amab.
Nyaaa then ja gotta deal with the thick squishy bouncy boobies, hips and waistline. You'd feel self conscious about those things then want to chop 'em off just the same. I really Friggin wish there was a character customization cut scene irl so we don't have to put up with all the weird bits. Like shi-et I'd love to just be a tight mass of muscles atop broad shoulders and cut abbs and strong chiseled masculine fit form.
sometimes i feel the same way, but then i remember periods exist and would probably be dysphoric as fuck (basing that off my AFAB cisn’t friends), and i’m kinda glad i got AMAB
This.

I would sign a blood pact with satan to go to hell to be tortured for all of time after i die to be afab and non binary.

But instead ive got *this* body. I hate it. But what is the community without dyphoria lol
Oh cool! We can swap then cuz I wanna be an amab enby lmao/lh
Yoo!! You should come over to my place and we can swap!! We could play video games and eat chips and do diy bottom surgery. It would be great!!
I'm afab nonbinary and trust me, it's not as great as it seems (I wouldn't mind only if I didn't have female sex characteristics). But I feel you, dysphoria is a bitch.
Let’s swap 😎
OH GOD YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME FR
hey that's so weird I was really feeling a lot more dysphoric this morning for the first time in a while. Was looking at binders online even but I'm autistic and I really hate getting clothes I haven't tried on or don't know what the texture is like. Anyway yeah nb afab here I really wish I was amab, I would def still be nb but I just have always been dysphoric with my chest. Wish we could swap!
Not to invalidate those who would feel dysphoria either way, but I'm AFAB nonbinary and am personally very glad I'm not AMAB. The female part of my gender is stronger than the male part and I get minimal to no dysphoria. I wish I was perceived as more androgynous and like presenting more masculine, but I don't plan on making on making on any physical changes to my body. So it is possible that OP would be happier as AFAB, but obviously it's also possible that they wouldn't.
I feel many people are missing the point OP is saying. I can't really speak for them, but I can speak for myself. I HATE my voice because it reminds me I'm perceived as a man to the people around me. If I had a switch to change my AGAB probably what I would feel more dysphoric about it would be my breasts depending on how big it was. 

Feeling dysphoric about my chest vs feeling dysphoric about my voice, body, face, hands, feet and the wide of my back, hell I would smash that button instantly.

I think this feeling is similar to transmasc non binary folks but of course in a reversed way.
I’m a bit confused. I thought being non-binary was someone okay with being mixtures of both genders. You’re saying you hate being masculine and having masculine features, wouldn’t that make you not non-binary? Can someone explain? Is my definition of it wrong?

Edit: not trying to be offensive, literally just don’t understand
it’s limiting, & it’s hell, & it’s the worst thing that ever happened to me. but idk, someone might enjoy being in this shitty hyperfemme body. 🤷🏼 

i wish i just… didn’t have an AGAB. do i know what that would functionally look like or how it would work? no. but i gotta make it happen or i’ll fucking explode.
ME TOO!!!
I'm AFAB nb and I want a dick even a small one...sigh....thinking of getting rid of boobs too...but they tiny anyways.
Same here <3
I feel exactly this a lot of the time.
I hate the fact that I have beard and body hair. The only hair I want are my beautiful long hair on the head. Then I hate the fact that my tummy is a male tummy, I would like to have a female tummy which is flat, at the same time smooth, without abs lines; mine has clear abs lines even if I don't do exercises or gym, my ribs muscles are visible too, I don't want those muscles. I hate them.
Same. I want to approach androgyny from the other direction, it would be so much easier to achieve my goals - I want to present masc and still be interpreted as androgynous-leaning-femme instead of having to present very femme to be interpreted as androgynous-leaning-femme. And yeah, I'll still get to that point eventually, but between HRT and bottom surgery to get rid of the bulge and electrolysis and facial feminization surgery it's a lot more work and a lot more money than if I was AFAB (where I'd probably want a hysterectomy and maybe low-dose HRT; not *nothing* but definitely *less*).
I feel the same way in the other direction! I want to have a more masculine body so I can be as feminine as I want without being seen as a woman. 

Had to stop T recently 😪 and feeling a lot of unexpected dysphoria.
I'm afab, and i understand you, but from the other side of this pont of view 
I love cute and feminine things, but i look way too much like a woman, have this thin voice that annoys me, and the chesticles are THE WORST 
I HATE that society sexualizes these fuckers, i hate that i have to always cover, bind, put bras, etc. 
I just wish i could look more like a verry feminine-femboyish man
I totally get how you feel *hugs*
Lawll i feel the same way but reversed wanna swap bodies🤑
Let's switch bodies
Oh... I wish I had a dick and I hate the way I sound sometime... For context I'm an AFAB nonbinary person and maybe considering going on T just to fuck with my body... But I don't want a beard. I would even consider cutting of my boobs (an other solution would be a breast illness of some type) for some neutral energy and look. Do you want to switch bodies? Please!!!

In all seriousness, being AMAB would be a dream come true cause I would have a dick, go on E and then cut off the boobs that appeared. Cause then I wouldn't have a beard and have nice and smooth hair...
I often think about this myself… but then I wonder if the grass is greener on the other side as well. Like if I were AFAB, but not a woman, would I find myself wishing I was AMAB? It’s confusing sometimes.
same but with amab
Same. My thoughts always cause me to doubt everything about myself and who I am. I wish for so many things and sadly many of them are only in my dreams. Ugh, why brains and hurtful thoughts?
I'm AFAB nonbinary and sometimes I wish I was AMAB. I think its a common nonbinary experience since many of us do want to transition for some reason or another but I'm sure that if it was the other way around I would be complaining about different things.
I feel similar. I have often thought that no matter my agab, I would be enby, but I do believe I’d be happier afab enby then amab enby. Either way there would be trials, but it’s this way and I’ll have to figure out who I am as amab instead. I hope you get through your dysphoria and that next time it’ll be easier
...trade you the body dysphoria that comes with wanting to be taller and having more muscle mass. I know I objectively have a solid, inverted triangle physique that AFAB people do not typically have. The dysphoria doesn't let me see what i've got, according to my partner and friends. Green grass, all that.
I’m an afab nonbinary person who is nonbinary because of my medical conditions. I deal with multiple disorders surrounding my reproductive organs and I often feel like I’m living two lives: my medical *female* one where I’m forced to think about myself in a sterile and animalistic sense with medical professionals often dismissing me. And another life socially where I’m able to be myself with my friends. On top of that of course is the third life, but the second one every trans person has: the one they lived before they broke the egg and figured out who they are. I still have to revert back to that in some settings. 

In my opinion, being nonbinary, *I wish I didn’t have to worry about this.* I wish I didn’t have anything, I could have just started with a healthy, functioning body, and everything would have been just fine. I’d meet people’s expectations, I wouldn’t be a “broken woman”, I’d be who I want to be and have always felt I am. These parts are just a big ball and chain I’ll have to carry for likely all of my life if I can’t get surgery, and even after that things like endometriosis still linger. 

The medical field does not tend to care much about afab people. *Especially not afab trans people.* You’ll always find reasons to be disappointed in the absolute biological sexes as a nonbinary person in my opinion, otherwise it might be good to consider your connection to the binary genders.
im in the same boat but the other way around
As one said:

》Im not enby as in ""yeet the teets"" but more in a way of ""sometimes put boobies to the side and sometimes put boobies back""《
Hah! I love this perspective. Very accurate to my experience of it all.🥲
I’m AFAB nb and feel exactly this way lol! Had my top surgery consult yesterday, I’m thrilled. But nothing quite replicates the other side’s xyz… I’m working to just accept some things.
Breasts. Period. Height. Voice. Jawline. Hand size. Adam’s apple. Pelvis. Muscular definition. Calves. There will always be something. “The grass is always greener”.

OP doesn’t want to be seen as a man. Unless being seen as a woman is part of their gender identity, they wouldn’t like being AFAB either.
Yep this 100%. I've gone over this so many times with my therapist because it always creeps back up on me. But every time I always come back to this conclusion. I wouldn't be perfectly happy regardless of AGAB. 

Being bigender nonbinary is so hard in this society. But with good friends and affirming family (by blood or found) it can be alright.
AFAB Nonbinary, tbh I wish I could just shapeshift to whatever gender I feel.
This. I am AFAB, I am only 5 ft tall and not wanting breasts and periods are my daily thoughts
agree, i wish i’d been born intersex tbh
Take my dick
Another AFAB here, can confirm, grass is just as brown and crunchy here as it is there 😭
I'm feeling it the other way around... I wish so badly I could just be an AMAB enby. Internally, that's how I feel. :(
dysphoria is the same but societal norms isn't. transmisogyny makes this stuff very difficult for AMAB people sadly
Thank you for validating me. ;) This is exactly what I feel, too. The only thing certain about my transition are my body goals. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to wrangle my identity.
>i wish i didn't have a period.

I think birth control might be able to help with that, if that's an option for you? I'm pretty sure my mom started taking birth control to stop her period because of the cramps and irritability from it
Genderpretzel. I like it. I'm stealing it cuz it accurately reflects how I'm feeling. At this point I've settled on nonbinary just cuz it's easier than doing all the self search and explaining that (as if it isn't hard enough to explain being enby to people already)
Genderpretzel, yeah, that’s it!!!!!
This is the perfect comment. Who wants to trade ass with me?
Detachable parts like if we were LEGO people
I feel the same way about AMAB nbs, i get so jealous of my own partner when I see them looking VERY FINE in outfits I wish I could wear, or when they get to run around so casually without a shirt. I can’t wait to get top surgery in a few months and join them in their shirtless frolicking *sigh*
We could practice voices and judge them objectively and do our nails
Oh my god, please!
There isn't one way to be nonbinary, it's a very wide spectrum.
It really depends on the person! Some people may want a mixture of gendered features, or no gendered features at all, or a specific mixture of features that may or may not be physically possible with our current technology. I consider myself non-binary, but hate having a lot of the features associated with my assigned gender.
Same! Sometimes I wanna get rid of them, but I know for a fact I will miss them! If only we had a switch for chests and crotches.
All the best for your surgery<3
[deleted]
my ideal presentation is significantly more skewed towards the femme side of things so in that respect being AFAB would make it easier to achieve, but had I grown up being AFAB that probably wouldn't be my ideal presentation any more
What is bigender? This is this 2nd time I’ve seen this term today and I’ve never heard it before.  Thank you!!!
""If you could have one superpower, wha---""

""SHAPESHIFTING!""
wish I could share my intersexiness with you 💙

I will say dysphoria still happens even then. It's like my brain is intersex in a different way than my body is intersex so they still don't align 🫤
Or you could try not saying that!
i will
Brown... crunchy... poisoned with toxins...
Transmisogyny sucks for sure but regular misogyny still exists. It’s still crunchy. People tend to forget that I think. Recognizing that doesn’t take away from the impact of transmisogyny or misogyny tho. To me, they’re just slightly different flavors of the same exact thing.
It totally does for some people but others can’t take hormonal birth control—I’m sure there’s lots of reasons but I was on it (and loved the more stable hormones) and then got critically ill from clotting due to the estrogen. The IUD has nowhere near the same positive side effects (low bleeding, but all the rest of the symptoms came back for me). Also also, my hematologist told me that T can cause clots just like estrogen birth control can, so options further limited, yay. /s
yeah, i've heard of that being an option, and while i'm really glad there is something for that, i know that i won't be able to take birth control for a while because i'm a teenager and my mom would never let me. it's not even really that i get bad cramps or feel really bad from my period, it just makes me feel gross and it's also just annoying to have to deal with everything that comes with a period (bleeding on stuff, getting blood stains on clothes when your period is unexpected/you forget to change your pad, etc.
I like genderpretzel, got a South American/german bakery in Richmond (Tasman region of New Zealand) and always get a pretzel to eat before considering anything else (don't like junk food) and I was born in Germany...am non binary trans femasc - pmab (presumed male at birth), feel both male and female inside and am now happy with my emotions I have, have nice boobs now and my bits down there are ok (don't feel the need to get rid of down there), dress femme, act a bit guyish at times although have joined the girls in dancing around topless...
Yeah! I always say Mr. Potatohead. I’d love so much to be able to switch parts out at will.
THIS. I can only imagine how amazing it'd feel to show part of my chest in public and not immediately be arrested or something lmao
Oh so non-binary is more of an umbrella term?
Shapeshifting is the way
Intersex enby here, you'd be forced to live as a binary gender anyway (most likely as a woman) and spend your whole life trying to undo the physical damage doctors did to you right after your birth.
Hey I'm intersex. I don't have a hard time being androgynous but I'm never feminine enough to be seen as a woman or masc enough to be seen as a man. This can be nice but it can also mean you're alienated by everyone with no way of conforming any which way, including for safety. 

Decisions were made about my body without my consent and because of the way my body works I might not be able to have kids. 

To the medical world I'm AFAB, just 'born wrong' but doctors don't know anything about my body or how medicines or procedures will react. Lots of people will dispute your biology to your face and expect you to let them know every tiny detail of how your most intimate bits work.

You actually feel both kinds of dysphoria. Something that made you happy yesterday is killing you today. Your body can feel weird and incomplete and euphoric all in the same moment. 

Your community is divided because even though you're all 'intersex' you all actually have wildly different bodies and experiences.

And then you have people online wishing to be in your shoes but not understand how much of an alien you feel in your daily life.
Yes, intersex people just have a wonderful time in this society. /s
Except that you’d likely have been operated on as an infant… let’s not minimize their struggles?
I'm intersex and it didn't help me one bit. I was surgically assigned as an infant and put on hormones before I knew what I actually wanted, and that was that. I don't think you actually want the loss of bodily autonomy that being intersex can involve

That’s not necessarily true, there are plenty of AFAB femme-leaning enbies
In one of those ""they should have figured it out earlier"" things, my default style of dress pre-cracking was basically butch lesbian.  So much so that I don't think anyone really noticed when I threw out most of my old plaid shirts only to replace them with more plaid shirts that were...brightly colored.
Possessing two genders simultaneously, or at different times. It's similar to genderfluid but more descriptive for folks who have more fixed fluctuation between genders or embody two genders at once.

Note: these aren't necessarily man and woman. They can be two nonbinary genders, for example.

To me it's the best way I've found to describe my gender fluidity. I sort of float between agender and demi-girl. Some days gender is important to me and others I wish I was a glowing orb of light. Also I, like all of us, lack the language to effectively communicate this 😅
For sure! There's a lot of diversity in the non-binary community.
Thats allways my answer to the classic superpower question
I hope I don't come off as too harsh because I don't mean to, but no, you didn't ""have that anyways"". There is a very large difference between being a certain way naturally and being a certain way because you had your body surgically changed without your consent. Surgery can cause lifelong complications and not being able to choose one way or another is horrifying. Quite frankly I don't think I'll ever get over it.
A lot of two spirit people, myself included, usually see themselves a bit this way. It's existing 24/7 as both genders. But like...fully both at all times.

You know what sucks? I will NEVER be able to talk to my doctor about it, unless I like...travel to an on-rez hospital with a gender specialist. Because telling someone without any knowledge of decolonized concepts about my legit two distinct selves existing side by side inside me at all time, informing my decisions and sharing their experiences, will land me in the psych ward. I tried to explain it to my friend that's a nurse and she got ""worried"" for me.

So I just tell medical professionals ""Nonbinary"" and leave it at that!
r/voidpunk is for the orb mood.
Thank you so much for this response. I appreciate the time you took to respond and help educate ❤️ this is really helpful to me as someone who struggle to sit within an identity. I identify as non-binary/agender/gender fluid because it really depends on the day lol!
Ah okay. Yeah there’s a lot of misinformation out there, so my understanding of some lgbt definitions are messed up. I don’t know if nobody tells me, ya know? Thanks for answering my question :)
Having the two spirit frame of reference and cultural understanding sounds nice. I'm not first nations, so I'd never claim two spirit, but like to my core there's a duality to who I am in this body. Bigender is the closest I've found to explain it.

It's a struggle to fully embrace my whole entire self and on the days it clicks into place I feel like a whole version of me in the most wonderful way. It's been a lot of unlearning from my upbringing to let myself be my whole self consistently and there's just so much societal pressure to be what others expect that it's always a struggle.

Fwiw I talk honestly about my experience and how I feel with my therapist and she doesn't seem to think I'm nuts and has outright said what I'm feeling doesn't look like DID either. She seems to kind of get it in some way and she's actually helped me embrace myself in my entirety more. I think I got lucky with my therapist though.
Oh wow I'd heard about bigender but never really understood it. This clears up alot. I've been calling myself genderfluid but I think I'm really bigender, as I've never really feel like either binary solidly and I do have internal personas (it's not DiD, they're original characters, but I do interact with them as weird as that sounds) that represent the different genders and sides of me. They've helped me understand myself which is really hard to define lol. I definitely don't tell that to many people because I'd sound crazy 😆

No worries. I think there's still a lot of discussion over what it means to be non-binary, even within the community. It's not a bad question :)
I think it's awesome that non-indigenous people have a term for it (this is my first time hearing it!), because I know the concept isn't indigenous specific. The title two-spirit is for sure indigenous, but I know the experience we have can be found anywhere, inside anyone. And since we're pretty rare - there aren't many openly two-spirit people out and about - I love the idea of finding bigender people I can really relate to. Not that I don't relate to other nonbinary people, I 100% do, but the concept of multiple selves chillin' all at once is very...specific? Finding people you can relate to is so important when discovering who *you* are, ya know?

Sounds like you did find a great therapist! I've had a bad history with mental healthcare, so I'm wary of like...being too honest with my therapists. But maybe one day I'll find someone I can be honest with...instead of whitewashing it to help it go down easier (and...ya know, keep me from getting locked up...).

Now I just need to find more ""I have long hair for cultural reasons, so please stop assuming I am female"" friends to commiserate with and I'll be set! 🙃
It doesn't sound weird to me! It sounds totally relatable and very similar to my own experience! I just call mine ""He"" and ""She"", and therein I am ""They"". Both are distinct, while both are very much me! Like, He is creative, gentle, introverted, and dangerously empathetic - She is confident, extroverted, knowledge hungry, and logical. And I can be any number of those things at any time. And I feel like it's somehow more poignant that my selves aren't necessarily tied to gendered stereotypes, either...like, She is more stereotypically ""masculine"", He is more ""feminine"".  

They're not intrusive thoughts, either, like psychosis style - I don't have weird voices telling me to kill people or anything, it's all MY internal monologue that I have complete control over, but I know when one is informing my thoughts more than the other. 

I have this theory of not-really reincarnation reincarnation, as in a whole person isn't reborn, but parts of them kinda are. That our spirits inform later generations with our experiences (thus generational trauma, but I think it also counts for generational joy, love, sadness, etc). And for me, I feel that I got part of the spirits of two of my ancestors instead of just one. And it's honestly awesome. It's not an illness, like some people think, because I ain't suffering...I don't need help, I just need to vibe.

Phew...sorry for the thesis! I get *really* excited when I meet like minded people!
Ya, there's definitely valid real worries about being too open with therapists. I've talked to enough people who've had really bad experiences to know how lucky I was to stumble upon my therapist. And just the history of medicine in general isn't trust inspiring either. 

I opened up to my therapist slowly to sort of test the water and make sure I was safe. Sort of touched on subjects cautiously and sussed her out before showing my full self to her. 

I don't blame you what so ever for being super cautious. Safety is an absolute requirement and kind of just overrides everything else."	xdp0q1	NonBinary	531	0.93	2022-09-14 01:44:04

I've been struggling with dysphoria and chronic illness lately. Got prettied up yesterday to help my mood, pls send love 🥺💖		"I just want to say, holy shit 🥲🥺😍
(also sending love)
Just know that decreasing dysphoria can help with some chronic symptoms so it might be a nice idea to focus on that yeah (got Ehlers Danlos and the ""usual""), hope you are able to be pretty like in this photo everyday.
You look stunning! I love everything about your outfit! The accessories, the makeup, your tattoos!

Also, you have very beautiful eyes! :)
All of the love!!!! You can do it! You did a whole thing yesterday getting dolled up and taking awesome photos, and that should be celebrated! 🥰
Wow, you look so awesome 🥰 i hope youll get better soon, best wishes :)
Beautiful!
You are completely lovely! ❤️❤️❤️
im chronically ill too. you look amazing 💜
[removed]
You're absolutely stunning!!!!
Chronic illness stinks.

You look good in that outfit. It suits you very well. Sending love.
Love the tattoo, the haircut, and everything else
You look very classy :)

Love the hair! That's the sort of style I was thinking of (keep my longer fringe but have the annoying side part shaved off) and I may just have to ask the salon if they can do this for me now I know how good it looks!
As a person with a chronic illness I can tell you that working on your looks and on anything else that may make you feel better psychologically is one of the best things you can do! And you are doing it great becuse you look really cool! (Also I've had that haircut for a long time! Super nice choice!)
😍😍😍
Very elegant!
I send good vibes for the bad things.

Also you're stunning and like, my ideal goal, if that's ok to say.
Utterly lovely.
Damn you are stunning. 😻
👏gor👏geous
I love that tattoo on your leg, holy shit! (Also, sending love 💗)
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Imma need you to share the pretty! You're gorge
You are very beautiful! 💖💐
Thank you! 😊💕
Thank you so much, that's helpful advice 😊❤️ Unfortunately in my situation, it's the other way around 🙁 I've been dealing with a bout of long covid that's left me with cardiovascular issues like frequent blood clotting and high blood pressure, so I've been on meds and making lifestyle changes to get my clotting factors back to normal so that I can safely start on estradiol. Latest bloodwork showed lots of improvement so hopefully will start HRT soon which will decrease the dysphoria! 🤞
Aww thank you so much 🥺💕
Thank you! You're totally right 😊🎉💕
Thank you! 💕
Thank you 😊❤️
Thank you! ❤️❤️❤️
Thank you 💕
Thank you 😊💕
Thank you! 😊💕
Thank you, much love to you too 💖
Thank you! 😊💕
Thank you! 😊💕 So flattered that my haircut can be an inspiration for you! I hope your cut turns out beautiful ✂️💖
Thank yoooou! 💕💖  You're so right, feeling beautiful somehow makes me feel healthier too ☺️
😊💕
Thank you! 💖
Omg thank you, that's totally ok to say ❤️ I feel kinda honored that you think I'm a goal, but I'm sure you're beautiful and will keep being beautiful no matter where your own journey takes you! Sending you good vibes too 💗
Thank you 😊💕
Hehe thank you ☺️💕
Health issues blocking/delaying the process of getting hrt sucks yeah, just think in what small ways that are presentable to you, permanent hair removal maybe, voice training if thats something for you, skin smoothing creams etc (hopefully you can/already do some of these yeah).
Anytime!!!
Thanks! 😀
Thank you 💖 You're a stellar bean c:
Starting hair removal next week! ☺️ Skin smoothing creams are a great idea that I actually haven't even considered! Gonna look into that more, thank you ❤️
Luck be with you!"	ox1bww	NonBinary	523	1.0	2021-08-03 11:18:27
Im trying to grow my hair but it often gives me some newfound dysphoria -.-		"I love that cup
I felt this. I’ll grow out my hair, feel dysphoric, cut it, then wish I had my long hair back? I currently have a mullet and tbh it’s actually a nice compromise between wanting long and short hair
I love your tattoos so much. That bird is precious
maybe use a beanie and pull the front back a bit (with bobby pins or something) to make it appear shorter while still letting it grow?
You look amazing! I know Dysphoria can suck, You you are great. Love the whole look of this pic. Your hair is on point, your cup is amazing, and I love your little birb tattoo. Keeping rocking and just remember you are a cool person, even when you are most dysphoric. <3
My dude in all things queer and awsome, you are a divine spark of the mystical rapture.

You are




 starlight made form.

You are 




MY FIIIIRE MY ONE DESIREEE BELIEVE WHEN I SAY I WANT IT THAAAAT WAAAAYYY
I too can find reasons to fit Dysphoria (fuck that shit) in everything about me, even what I choose and like, sometimes specially this. Someone I know used to tell me I should go in front of a mirror, preferably without clothes and say ""I am sooooooo hot"" untill I believed it. Tbh I rarely got to believe it, but it always helps with my mood cuz there's no way to not start laughing. So, dear, Idk if anyone can really help u cuz that is what u feel and there's also no, for the lack of better word, cure for Dysphoria (fuck this motherfucking shit again). I just try to live one day at a time and it's not easy, but I'm following my own path and that makes me glad. Personally I just find u an amazing and wonderful creature, but nothing me or anyone thinks means anything if u don't feel it too. I know it's hard to get to smile most of the times, but try to think this way, you are *choosing* to grow your hair, even with the hurting, it's an act of your true will and that is what makes it special, being genuinely you. I can for sure admire this. Maybe if u try to mentalize that even with the D kicking in that is a path u want to take it could help. So let's put the whole gender thing aside and look at the core of it, u choosing that is doing what u want with your life and belonging to yourself, that's what makes it special. I hope u can manage to deal with the struggles and follow your wishes, take care, OP. U r dope. ♡
I'm bald now (thanks genetics) but I used to have 10-12"" long hair.  There is definitely a phase while growing it out that you just sort of hate how it looks.  It's okay to feel that way.

There's a quote I like a lot, that can apply to a lot of situations. ""You develop taste long before you develop skill.""  In the case of your hair, you know what you want, and how it'll look on you, you just haven't developed that skill yet to match.  It'll take time, but you'll look at your hair one day and feel that bliss of being in your body wash over.
That cup>>
I used to struggle with the same thing, it was actually shaving my head that let me grow my hair out. Doing it that way made it grow in the way boys hair does when they decide to grow it out, you get all the awkward phases of course but being able to point to the growth and say ""I've seen a cis man with this hair"" helped
That cup… *gives me conniptions.*
Whole ass mood friendo. I desperately wanna cut it because it's so bad, but the endgame is gonna be so good tho 😭
I get you! You could try sticking it back?
I get the same way with my long hair sometimes but I like to just remind myself that long hair can also be just as masculine if you think about it :) I mean all the coolest looking guys have the longest hair imo
You can definitely go for a skater/surfer type of look if you want it to be a bit longer! My hair is about chin length and I wear it up a lot so I get where ur coming from with this. Some ppl might see it as feminine but really it’s just hair tbh
Felt. I feel like I *have* to have boy cuts. Hoping I'll get over it at some point.
That mug tho i love it.
I love the mug
The cup had me laughing 😂 it's perfect. I feel you, my hair can never stay the same length, always growing longer than I wanted it to be. I hope you can figure it out and get the look/ hairstyle you want ❤
Try to shave some parts if you want to have long hair, like death hawk or undercut, you know, personally I have an high undercut and long hair, I always say that even my haircut is non binary !

Then if you want to look more masculine you attach them and if you want to look more feminine, well, you got it haha, you can switch, tested and approved for 3 years 👌 (Mine are always attached 😑)
I think it looks really gender natural.  How long are you wanting to grow it?
yeah I always keep the undercut to balance it, but it’s hard to stay patient with hair growth 🥲
the mighty raging crowlet !
I do bobby pins a lot! But it makes me look even more fem tbh :D
🖤🖤🖤
that escalated quickly :D
thank´ you 🖤
it’s what i usually do
Same 

I also have the feeeling
I already have the undercut ;)
it’s already chin length and I wanna try longer

My top surgery is in two weeks and I want to go swimming in these outfits next week despite all chest dysphoria because this way I can say goodbye for good:D (multiple pictures)		"Hey hey! My top surgey is in two weeks too! The 24!
The last Halloween before my top surgery I did a costume with my boobs on full display. I did not regret it. Very hyped for my first Halloween sans boobs.

Congrats and best wishes! ❤️
Congrats and also I LOVE that goth top. Any chance you know where you got it?
Congratulations :)) Loving the style
Congrats and good luck! Have fun swimming ✨
Congrats!! Also I need to know where u got the sword fish long one price swimsuit bc that shit slaps and it's exactly the kinda thing I want
Edit; NARWHALS not swordfish omg even better
Aww I can't wait to actually get top surgery one day in the future! But good luck and I hope for a speedy recovery 😉.
So happy for u!! Hope it goes super smoothly
Ayy mines a day after yours, good luck pal!
Nice, that sounds awesome and also hey I'm not the only one with the idea to show them to everyone before yeeting xD
The one with the cutout cutout is from EMP I believe (German store and a big one at that), and the fishnet is somewhere from etsy (edit: found it: SeleneTarotBoutique)
Thanks:)
It's from Tomboyx, I ordered and later found out there's some controversy around them but the products itself are nice! I'm thinking about ordering a flowery tank top or a romper as well (it's expensive though, but I consider myself a rich bitch for my age lol thank you grandma)
You'll get there pal, I even lost hope in the past and now I'm so close it's unreal and thank you:3
Thanks! I'll update once I feel good/clear enough to take a pic (I have a history of being very foggy after anesthesia, for my last surgery I was completely out of it and confused for three days... But I was also under it for six hours, now it's like 1-2)
♡♡♡♡ im already half way through the alphabet in terms of bra sizing and absolutely MISERABLE. I can't wait to get these off.
Thanks! My friend is going to go crazy for the EMP one so if I can find that, her Christmas gift will be set :-)
Uh oh that sounds heavy (like so heavy a reduction would be beneficial even without gender dysphoria), mine are luckily rather small (B, perhaps a small C at most) and I can live with them but they still don't belong there

I'll post updates as soon as I feel good enough to take pics again:)
It's called gothicana if I remember right, mine is actually a bodysuit/swimsuit but I more often than not just wear it as a regular shirt lol
I don't qualify for a reduction because I have a condition where mine will never stop growing. The chances of regrowth after a reduction is extremely high. I opted for the chest chop. ETA: mine are at an I cup (us size).
Ooh thanks!
I? Damn. I have a friend with F cups and I thought that was huge! Lmk how it went, all the best for you and your recovery!
If it’s not too invasive, could you tell what condition that is?
It's as miserable as it sounds. I saw no way out other than the chest chop. Best wishes on your recovery as well!
Breast Hypertrophy.  The breast oncologist also told me that all her patients with gigantomastia start out like me 😔
Thanks! And I'm glad to know the whole boob ordeal is over soon
You are true warrior, dear. I know that condition really well, my great aunt had it too and at least where i am from, it's rare. She gave up and chopped them off. 

I'm rooting for you in the distance and wishing you all the best in the surgery, everything will go awesome ♥️

 Will light a candle for you and OP on that day, if you read this, lemme know what name you want me to tell the universe when lighting it 🥰
I mean, I don't blame your aunt one bit. I'm partially getting the chest chop because I've honestly given up too and I see no other options...."	y3p9zn	NonBinary	508	1.0	2022-10-14 09:36:04
got my septum pierced and I’m riding the high from exercising some control over my dysphoria inducing flesh prison		"Idk if this will help but those cheek bones are sharp as fuck
Sorry about the dysphoria :(

It looks great tho
Love it and your enby vibes
Looking good you look pretty androgynous
Wow you are a serious babe
oh wait I recognise you from Twitter before I deleted! nice to see you again
😨😍😨😍😨😍
That's why I got my most recent piercings too! I realllly want my septum but I have to decide if it's worth taking out my nostril for since I don't want both. Decisions are the worst
Did it hurt a lot? I've been thinking about getting one but I almost faint when I get any piercings due to the pain.
This is literally the reason I have stretched ears now 😂 you look awesome with a septum!!
I like you
Ellis I follow you on Twitter! Wasn’t expecting to see your face here but damn I am NOT complaining 🔥
U gawgeous
You have added a convenient handle for restraining runaway flesh prisons. This is a significant upgrade.
Caption is a big mood.
You are a lovely human!
Wowie you look majestic as fuck
I’ve been debating on getting my septum piercing !! Idk, I have hopes it’ll make me look more masc
I'm waffling trying to decide whether I want a nostril or septum piercing almost exactly like yours. I thought I'd decided on nostril but yours looks so damn good I'm not sure anymore :D
Sorry about the dysphoria, but you look rad. Instead of a meat prison, I now try to think of my body as a meat car. It requires fuel, needs daily maintenance, and occasionally leaks fluids. We can change bits and pieces over time to make it feel more comfortable to drive, but you'll always be the driver and you can always steer where you want to go. I hope you'll feel proud of your meat car soon, because the driver is already very awesome!
I had the same feeling with my septum!! Was my first body mod I got to choose no matter what anyone thought I was able to change myself to something I wanted! Awesome feeling ☆
Lol please tell me the condition is anything besides Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome?
thank you I wish they looked as good as they do in photos irl
thanks, this has definitely taken the edge off it for today at least!
thanks!
ahh small world!
I can definitely see why piercings are so common among trans folks - it feels so good to exercise a bit of control over your body and come away with something new you actually like about yourself. I would have considered a nostril piercing myself but cartilage piercings aren’t a good idea for me because of a genetic condition that fucks with my healing ability
I mean, it depends a lot on your pain tolerance. I have severe chronic pain so I’d say I have a pretty high pain tolerance, so my answer might be a bit skewed. personally I didn’t find it extremely painful, it makes your eyes water like hell because of where it is and it’s a pretty sharp pain but not unbearable by any means and very quick so if you really want it I’d say even if you find it really painful it’ll be over fast. it hurt more than my lobe piercings (but then I really didn’t find them that painful at all) when it was being done, but isn’t throbbing now it’s done like my lobe piercings did, so the pain is more focused on the actual moment of piercing.
what’s your @? I’ll follow you!
yeah part of the reason I got mine was hoping it would make me more androgynous/masc and I feel like it has a bit and I think it’ll look even better with my face when I go on T and get my hair cut
apparently septums tend to be less painful and heal easier since it’s not through cartilage, if that helps sway you at all!
I have EDS yeah lmao good guess
Honestly I bet they do. Strong jaw, too. You remind me of the long-haired hero. I almost expect you to have a sword lol
honesty i mostly remember because I thought you were super hot. im a lesbian and not actually interested at all but you look like gerard way and I've always been into him 🤷‍♂️
@laurensjdee - I haven’t come out on there yet but I’m working on it 💜
Yeah I do too and I'm starting to think it causes some kind of transness by the number of us there seem to be. 

FWIW I do have both my nostril and a pair of helix piercings though. I think my helix peircings may have healed better than average because I have really thin flexible cartilage there which can be an EDS trait? Nostril has been more of an issue but still worth it to me. Still these were definitely things I did in spite of my EDS - or maybe TO spite it, since sleeping on one side is a challenge, MCAS is as challenge, etc
Like Dario Naharis from GoT: https://images.app.goo.gl/2Ju4W9joVLovXX2R6
lmao I’d definitely like a sword tbh
haha thanks, I’ve had the gerard way comparison several times before actually and I appreciate it
yeah the number of trans EDS patients I’ve come across is definitely noteworthy, there’s certainly a lot of us lmao. I do wonder if there’s some kind of link, I know there’s some question whether there’s a link between autism/adhd and transness and then there’s potentially a link between EDS and autism/adhd do there might be something there. 

I’ve really struggled with even healing my lobe piercings so I’ve decided not to risk it anywhere it might leave an obvious scar (like on the outside of my nose aha)"	c4qm46	NonBinary	505	1.0	2019-06-24 16:13:41

Great to see a fellow parent around here! I'm amab so never had to deal with pregnancy dysphoria. That must have been rough. But it looks like you're doing great now!

I often cook pizza with my 6yo son so I understand the, er, unique joys of kitchen collaboration with a child. Fun and challenging, am I right?

Also great to see some more body positive representation on this sub 😊
I’m sure you’re such an amazing parent so I’m glad you made it to the other side of that! Also heckin cute

Look what your powerful body made!
I'd never trust a skinny chef. And I love the idea of chef as a pronoun.

omg who's the author of this drawing? it's so beautiful!
That is a *very* small butterfly. :)
This is awesome, to the phone back drop collection it goes!

Thank you frogy
Thank you for fighting that beast kind warrior 😌
Don’t know original artist 🤷🏼.
I did the work to alter the frog’s cape and the beetle’s saddle/blanket. Both were red prior to my alterations.
I was just thinking that.

Or horse sized beetle, which would be neat and terrifying
do you have a link to the unaltered version?
I saw it on Reddit, but I couldn’t find the post again. So I googled it:

I did a reverse image search for that, found a reddit post, searched the OP's comment history, and found this:

The dysphoria buster. I love this outfit although I’ll never wear it out (with good reason)		"You rock it so hard! Hope you find a safe enough context to grace the world with your divine presence :)

You look really great in it.

Why won't you wear it out?
Omw you're so cool
Pardon me but that outfit SLAPS I love it!!!
I dress sort of like that, people just stare at me lol
Just saying your kinda cute
Oh my goodness I need you as a personal fashion guide!
God that’s a cute outfit
one day i aspire to ascend to your level of awesome *angelic choir*
Omg aren't you the cutest

I wanna wear crop tops too outdoors, I have a pretty cute tummy. But I'm a little old to wear crop tops to work and I have social phobia sooooo 😕
Okay so that is a great outfit and you are \*super super\* cute
Beautifully constructed sentence. And thank you.
😘
My mum won’t let me, which is fair do to it being revealing. Although if I ever go to a party, i sure as hell am wearing it.
Nobody is born cool... except for: people who comment their enjoyment of others content.
I’ve never heard someone use “SLAPS”. I like it
That’s amazing.
Thanks beautiful.
I’m not that good. Just think about individual pieces of clothing look on you. Then mix and match.
Thank you:)
Perfectly executed. And I ain’t no angle, darlin’ the spot lights on you.
maybe if you go to a semi-social place you could, like with friend(s). or maybe just at a friend's place.   
'Cause if you got it and you like it, then use it
why thank you.
It's a bay area thing.
Yeah it's interesting, not many people think that my city, being in Texas, is liberal and Progressive and over 90% Hispanic.
if you were an angle you'd be acute one

if only i had a social sphere =P

This shirt gives me massive dysphoria but I'm keeping it to wear after top surgery to see my progress		"I have so many fem clothes and I want to reclaim them someday when I'm where I want to be.
I'm also trying to grow a following on my Webtoon comic ""Eli's Adventures"", a doodle diary about my struggles with gender identity, sexuality, and general life experiences! Please check it out!

I was sorting through my clothes today and kept one shirt for this very reason.
Saaaame.

So many feminine clothes that I want to try on againt after top surgery :D also. dresses. floral, yellow, bright and happy dresses. I want to try those too :D
heh, Chesty Puller puns...
Or you really like the shirt since most of mine are fandom shirts but it form fitting so you wear baggie hoodies over it
This just made me thing of something. You know those gag shirts with a design to make it look like you have massive boobs? I wonder if the opposite is possible, so that if you have it on it makes your chest look smaller just because of the pattern printed on it
dude that's awesome! :D i kinda get what you mean, i hate my boobs and can't wait until i turn 18 so i can chop them off but i like comparing pictures/my reflection not binding to pictures/my reflection while binding just to see how flat it makes me

(also yall i can't be the only one who always finds excuses to look at my chest while i'm binding lmaooo)
Yes exactly!
I will because I'm bored and the drawing above is very wholesome
Edit: holy shit that was so wholesome I'm so happy for you
Thats awesome bro! I hope you find love and happiness, my man!
Its too relatable
yessss
get it? CHESTy puller
Omg i wish i had the financial stability to buy fandom shirts
omg like a binder shirt
So diagonal stripes are the most minimizing afaik, like if you’ve got a button down shirt with diagonal stripes it helps to make the frame look more rectangular and boxy.
thank you! I'm glad you like my drawings that means a lot!

thank God somebody does
fuck yeah
god i hate binding. I look like my best self but at what cost, yknow?
are cheez thems just nonbinary cheez its? lmao maybe I'll start calling them that

kinda like how I call special K cereal Special Gay
I don't actually know, I'm AMAB, But I've just never been able to breathe, That's just how my life is. Except when I drink tea, Then I can breathe.
Yes, but also cheez its grammatically don't make sense. Multiple ""its"" are them or those, more those than thems but it makes less sense to say cheez those, cuz it sounds like youre using cheez as a verb...

And people say that enbies are fucking up grammar lmao

today i got a breast reduction down to an A cup	i was kind of reluctant to do so because i’ve heard of stories where people have asked for A cups and woke up with C cups with the surgeon saying “you’ll thank me later”.  but during my consultation I told the surgeon i decided to get it because of my gender issues. i asked if he could make it more “non-binary” and he said absolutely! (i fluctuate she/they but my large chest has always caused MASSIVE dysphoria since puberty) I’m now very flat chested and very happy with my decision, i’m currently wearing a sports bra and as flat as I was when I would wear a binder with my larger chest. I plan on updating when I’m healed enough to wear a binder to see if i get the extra flat look. I’m over all very happy with the results and glad I made this decision! here are the [day 1 results](https://ibb.co/vqC5kW4) for anyone interested	"I’m so very glad you got a surgeon that listened to you and did what you ask. I’m also so glad you are happy and doing well. It means the world to have your dysphoria relieved even a little. I wish you rapid healing and an easy recovery.
also i don’t have a good perspective on “cup
sizes” as i’ve been wearing sports bras since puberty. i’m not sure if it’s exactly an A but it’s wayy smaller than i was and good enough for me :)
also, it’s only been mere hours but my recovery is going extremely well. i didn’t feel sick or “high” when i woke up, the nurses who helped me get dressed jokingly asked if i was sure i just has surgery lol. i have minimal pain and have to restrain myself from physical activities because aside from minor aches I feel pretty normal, i’m also quite hyper by nature lol. I expect that to maybe change tomorrow since I’m on stronger meds today but starting tomorrow i’ll be on tylenol
Congrats ! it looks great. I had full on breast removal and I also had barely any pain. Sometimes it seems to not hurt as much as expected it seems
Congrats! I hope your healing goes well 🙂
That's awesome. I've also thought about getting a breast reduction instead of full top surgery because I get some sexual satisfaction from them. Is it different than the process for top surgery, like you drains and risk of loss of feeling?

Looks great anyway. Glad you had such a cool doctor.
That's awesome!

Also, did you say some doctors do the opposite of a breast reduction against someone's will? How is that not medical malpractice?
congrats!! hope it’s ok to ask but do you know what style of surgery yours was called and whether nipple sensation is lost? i’ve been looking into reductions for a while and can hardly find good info on this
Looks amazing! Congrats! I'm hoping to get something similar done eventually
Congrats!! I’m hoping to get a reduction soon, I hope this brings you so much joy!!
Congrats! Hope for a speedy healing!
Yay!
Congrats!! I hope to do the same within the next year
Yay!!! Wish you a speedy recovery 💕✨
That’s amazing! I’ve been really considering a breast reduction or full removal of my chest and this just made feel a lot better.
Yeah, I'm totally not over here crying happy for you right now ❤️ 

I'm new to learning about all of this but I've hated my large boobs for so long and have considered a reduction but km scared to come out with a C or larger (which would still be a reduction, but not what I want). 

Thanks for giving me some hope ❤️❤️
>*people have asked for A cups and woke up with C cups with the surgeon saying “you’ll thank me later”.*

&#x200B;

I hope those people sued the heck out of them and got their license away for good.
Can you update us on your recovery? How are u feeling? How are the scars healing? Do your breasts still jiggle? It's incredible that you got this done. There are so many of us in need of this kind of ""in between"" *still valid* top surgery. Please please share if you can! Greatly appreciated. 
Also how much did it all cost?
Congratulations! I hope you heal well, be gentle with yourself. You may experience an 'oh shit what have I done?' moment- it's super common to experience when we see ourselves injured and vulnerable like that. I did and I LOVE my new chest and am grateful to myself everyday for doing it.
Curious, since you framed your reduction as also a chance to be more “non-binary” how did that reflect in the actual surgery other than just size? Did the surgeon change your nipple diameter, or do anything else structurally to cause a physical change to the breast tissue?
Surgeons who intentionally go against what the patient wanted in something like that (c cup instead of a cup) are very sueable.
Didn’t know you could get reductions!! I’ll have to look into that
Thank you for sharing your story.  I am glad to know that I am not the only one that feels this way.  I would really love to present more androgynous all the time, but my DD chest gives me away every time.  I have not had success with binders, so, for now, I just roll with it.  I would love to get reduction not just for the dysphoria, but also because they have always been big and painful.
Congrats! ❤️
This is somewhat old but if you see this I’m curious, with this size do you have to wear a bra or can you go without comfortably, and is there any like, ‘jiggling’ with excersise? I’m deciding what I want as I quite like how i look under my clothes with my binder and I’m not sure if I want to be 100% flat!
Oooh this is great to hear!! I want a reduction to something I can bind flat but still have “boob days” I’m an H cup so it’s been nigh impossible to wear anything without people staring/commenting/noticing of them making my clothes tug or fit in a way that makes me really dysphoric. What made you choose A cup versus a B or C?
Who was your surgeon x
A few months later, how are you feeling? I'm wanting to reduce to a- and having a hard time getting examples to show the Dr. since they usually get full removal requests.
Check out r/abrathatfits once you’re recovered if you’d like to know your size/shape!
So glad to hear it went so well for you!
Honestly my wisdom teeth hurt more so I can attest
Oh man I wish I had that experience. Mine was excruciating. But also I'm a redhead and our pain receptors are weird.
thanks!
I didn’t get drains but other people do get them for reductions. I’m not really sure what it depends on but if you ever decide to get a conciliation you can ask whether or not you’d get drains. I didn’t experience any loss of feeling, really the only risk (aside from infections and what not) is the nipples falling off which is rare
i have no clue!! maybe in their case it’s a medically required surgery where they’re getting a reduction due to back pain? mine was through a plastic surgeon so i guess i had that control over my results.  either way it’s really messed up.
It's not really the opposite, they just don't reduce them as much as people ask for, under the assumption that they'll regret such a drastic reduction later.
I’m pretty sure mine was the “anchor method”, and it was specifically under plastic surgery which is why I was able to have control over the size. (People who who go on a referral due to back pain etc don’t really get to chose the resulting size. Usually they just reduce a specific amount of mL). As for nipple sensation, I can’t really tell you for sure as I didn’t have much sensation in mine to begin with since i used to abuse binders 😬. But from what i’ve heard it’s not very common to lose sensation in them. Really the best you can do is research LGBT friendly surgeons in your area and go over their reviews, some surgeons have a surprising amount of patients with complications with lost sensation etc.
r/reduction may be another good place to ask
radical breast reduction is valid top surgery ! :)  i think you would be happy with either choice as long as you go with a surgeon who has experience in gender-affirming surgery
The best thing you can do is find an LGBT friendly surgeon who has experience in gender affirming surgery. Mine does both breast reductions and top surgeries which is why I think he was very accepting about what I was looking for, I hope you get what you’re looking for some day! 💗
normally for breast reductions they plump-out the breast/ do augmentation. instead of that, he did liposuction so that they were more flat instead of plumped up. i do believe he said the nipple diameter would be smaller too but i can’t quite remember and they’re still under bandages, but in general the traits are closer to a chest-masculinization; like “mosquito bite” or pecs
But think about their future husband's happiness! /s
I kinda had that happen to me but the opposite direction. I'm male leaning non binary that wanted some boobs. Comfortable wearing b cup forms long story short ended up having breast surgery. But instead of small bs I ended up full Cs. Due to my PS strongly urging me that they would look so much better on my frame. I was shocked when I first saw them, he kept telling me they would shrink after swelling and look great, the results are nice but much more noticeable especially when I'm in guy mode
Dr Jayson Dool, from Moncton Canada
same boat here ;;;
I’ll check this out thank you!
My wisdom teeth also didnt hurt at all but I also have a rather high pain tolerance so that might be it
Congrats I'm so happy for you! I'm kinda in the same boat as you and I'm considering a reduction but I am worried about losing nipple sensation. That's really the only thing I like about having boobs lol. Wish I could just pop them off and put them in a drawer when I'm not having le sexi times 😭
That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for replying! I’m looking into reductions vs top surgery and with being an Enby it adds another dimension to the research. Super happy for you that your surgery went well, you’re recovering well, and I hope you achieve the look you desire!!
You're lucky! I have a high tolerance too but unless I was on Tylenol that surgery definitely kicked my butt!"	ymadpt	NonBinary	398	1.0	2022-11-04 21:03:38

Feel like shit after scrolling through hateful comments	"(TW: Enbyphobia, Transphobia, Vent)

Reddit just served me a freshly baked, dysphoria-inducing hot meal and I ate it all up like a curiosity-fueled and starving cat.

Some thread on Reddit made it onto my front page and it's about us. Don't look for it if you haven't seen it, trust me. I felt curious about what people thought about us and before I knew it, I scrolled through it all.

Fuck though, it feels awful. I know there's a bias where mostly the bigoted people are responding, and there were nice people who defended us on there, but still, it's like my worst fears all laid out in front of me. I'm always feeling like crap anyway since I can never reveal this part of me to anyone in my real life. I always think about how I could never tell my therapist and I wonder if they would even accept me if I told them. Not because of them specifically, I just don't think anyone would accept me in real life.

Back when I was 'just' bi, it was still hard, but at least I felt like I had a community and that most open-minded people would respect me. Being non-binary, I feel more alone than ever.

Sometimes I wonder why I don't just go back into the closet. Sometimes I think of forgetting all this, suppressing it deep inside and never telling a soul about what I am. I can endure it. Maybe I'll even grow numb to it enough that I can live a long life as a cis person. Maybe this time.

Sorry for the negativity, I'm really just looking for support or understanding, I'm at my wit's end.

Edit: The response to this post has been overwhelming, but wonderful. I wish I could respond to every one of you and send you all my deepest gratitudes. Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to help a complete stranger like me. I hope you're all having a wonderful day, do something kind for yourselves, you deserve it."	"Hey friend, I'm here for you. And I'm sure many more of us on this sub are as well. I hopped on today to vent my frustrations as well, about how I feel like a failure and a coward for not telling anyone in my daily life or at work that I'm nonbinary, that I don't want to be misgendered. But when I see someone else struggling I have to step up for them. No pity parties, but we've got to just keep moving, try to tune out (or stomp out) the bad vibes, and embrace those rare moments of support and allyship. Just know you've got friends here ☺️
This is the comment I left on there :


> That non binary people are all different and that there are many different kinds of us, so I shouldnt think of it as a monolith or that there is ""one way"" to be non binary. Much like cis, trans, other non binary people, and everyone else -- we are all complicated and fluid people. We are valid. 🖤 💜 💛 🤍 

& its true! The haters are wrong. You are valid. I'm sorry this happened, we deserve better 💖
I think the best strategy is not looking at the ""troll feeding posts"". Most people are keyboard warriors, but in real life they are scared of confrontation. 

I'm a very androgynous person in real life and I just pretend that nobody cares. I know they care, but I pretend I'm the most normal and relaxed person in the planet. It is very rare that someone touches the subject with me.

They just don't want to pay the price of their tongue. So they go around in circles when they need to ask questions. And I just dance the question dance as indirectly as possible. 

I have my lawyer's contact and a pepper spray in hand just in case. Never had to use them.

The real struggle we have to group together and focus on is the political one.
when i think about how far homophobia has been to an extent dampened out in the past 10-15 years, i hold onto the hope that for trans and nb folks, we will see the same. hang in there <3

edit-in parts of western society ofc, ymmv. rough to get through particularly in the uk the rampant transphobia atm
I read the post too. I think I could ignore a lot of it, because screw em, but there was one comment that was essentially >!""I'm bisexual and I feel like all these trans folks are really setting back queer equality with their flavor-of-the-month gender and pronouns""!< (cw: transphobia) and gosh, did that one really hurt. It's like... what, your queerness is becoming more accepted, so heck off to everyone else that wants the same? Oh, yOu DoN't UnDeRsTaNd?? Gee, I wonder where *I've heard that argument before*.
I saw that same thread! It seems like most of the people commenting there are exactly the people they’re complaining about - they certainly seem to be the ones who are really into making a huge deal about our genders, pronouns, and what we may or may not look like. :) Some people you meet will be judgmental, but they’re not the people who are worth having as friends anyway and if they root *themselves* out they’re basically doing you a favor.
It’s ok to feel like this, it happens. You just gotta fight through it or fight back.
""Perhaps you are shit."" Was that supposed to make me feel bad? Haha wtf. Playground insult.
People are threatened by new perspectives. The idea that people don't connect or identify with a specific gender roll is something they haven't even considered before. The idea that they don't know something threatens their pride.

It will take a long time but people have always invalidated everyone who isn't cis and straight. This isn't something new. Hate and judgement has always been a huge force. But if you live needing other people to understand and accept you there is a good chance you will be unhappy

You are you and that's okay. You don't need the world to get you. You know you. And that's all that matters. People thinking that being non binary is invalid is something that will not change soon because they have no way of understanding or seeing from a perspective they can't grasp. 

People want things to be cut and dry and have been culturally conditioned to see the world in a specific way. It hurts but honestly I don't need people to understand for me to be valid. And neither do you. 

Just love yourself and know yourself. The world has never wanted to make a place for people that are different and this isn't anything new. Fuck em. Don't consider the opinions of people unable to understand. It's like trusting a book review from an illiterate.
Our identity literally threatens one of the power structures society is built around globally. We're never gonna have it easy, but damn, do we look good, OP. Don't sweat it, stop reading it, go do some self-care and remember that it's easy to type shit on a Reddit thread but most of these people are basement-dwelling dumpster fires IRL.
A reminder that consuming content you KNOW will distress you (eg, looking at the comments of a post when you *know* it will be filled with hate) when it serves no productive purpose is emotional self-harm.

Stressing yourself out in a completely non-productive way does nothing but spike your cortisol levels, and put strain on your body and mind. Just because it doesn't leave physical marks doesn't mean it's not self-harm.

Additionally, the opinions of bigots come from a place of hate based in (often willful) ignorance. You cannot educate or shift people who fundamentally do not want to be corrected, and instead come to magnet posts like that to wallow as a group in shared hate and bigotry. You wouldn't go to a klan rally hoping to find a few people speaking sense about race; most reddit posts in general about trans and NBy people outside of overtly LGBTQ+ supportive subs are going to be filled with people who have made little to no effort to educate themselves from sources not biased towards hate, and only want to feel the pleasure/validation of being part of an in-group (where trans/NBy people are the out-group).

If a total strange came up on the street and told you ""I hate you and hope you feel bad!"" for no reason at all, you'd think they were a psycho, and you certainly wouldn't take it to heart if you have any sense or self-respect - especially not if they prefaced that with ""I'm a proud bigot who knows nothing about nothing!""

So, OP, going forward - love yourself. Respect yourself. Don't engage in self-harm out of 'curiosity,' and don't hurt yourself taking the words of ignorant bigots to heart.
You should be able to tell your therapist anything. If you tell them this and they don’t support you then you’re seeing the wrong therapist. I’m right there with you though, only being out to a select few in my life, but wanting to just be out entirely. It’s so hard. I’m working on that with my therapist too and she’s fucking amazing. I’m so grateful. I want you to have that too friend. Stay strong and do not push it deep down in you. It will only cause more problems. We are here💜
Yeah I spent way to long on that post and there was a lot of bigoted bullshit. I was pleasantly suprised at how many people just genuinely didn't understand and were either asking questions or saying they'd respect pronouns and just move on
I relate to this so much at this moment because I had to leave an exclusive Reddit group this weekend because the mod posted something transphobic and then defended it afterwards. They asked in this POC friendly space - how many Black people have ""adopted the word cis"" and all comments were against trans people. When I complained, I was told by the mod that this would continue to happen so I should get used to it and ""this is what Black people deal with every day so if you hate transphobes get used to it because I hate white people"" was another comment. I left the group because it clearly wasn't a trans-friendly space as the mod had claimed. He said it was just like a post someone else made about hating Nigerian people that he left up despite being Nigerian himself. To me, that's different than a mod making a transphobic post. Sorry to rant, but didn't get much response here when I tried to vent about it this weekend. It's like open season on enbys and trans people right now. Stay strong and hang in. There are people out there who are out and fighting for more rights and representation.
Reading those comments can sometimes be a method of self harm. I know it can feel like you need to check them out for whatever reason, but you really don't. It's okay to protect yourself, and to consciously decide to not go down those rabbit holes. Remind yourself that the people making these comments want you to hurt, and you don't need to put yourself in harm's way.
Reddit has a rep for being Liberal but I haven't a clue why. It's full of nasty, bigoted people. I got called a Karen and accused of expecting special treatment for suggesting Amazon expand their delivery instructions box to make it easier for physically disabled people to notify delivery that they may take longer to answer the door. Apparently they should just ""try other places until one meets their anomalous needs"". This was by two different men months apart. Although one also started making strange sexual comments so not sure what his motivations might have been. Months later and I noticed Amazon did indeed increase its delivery comment character limit in many cases, so my households circumstances couldn't have been that ""anomalous"" after all. I just hate how much Reddit enables these idiots. 

Progressive paradise Reddit ain't.
I got u. We got you. People who are hateful bring me down. But they don't matter. If you need to talk, you can, perhaps try to talk to friend or family. If not, try therapy, it might not work, but you should really try to get it off your chest. Sending live and support! 💙
this is literally how i feel. exhausting
I've gone through Asexual hate and now, Non-Binary hate \[both from Cis/Het and LGBTQ+\].  LGBTQ+ people are just as nuanced as Cis/Het people can be.  And it stings to see the hate.  Hell, one of the gaming communities I'm in, I mentioned I was Asexual and Agender, but I still love the romances and I got voted down (and they are usually a more accepting bunch.)

I hate seeing the negativity.  I hate seeing the hurt.  Don't go back into the closet, don't let the views of little-minded people force you to be someone you're not.
a lot of bigoted people have the same arguments and will do anything to make you miserable just because they can. it's unfortunate that the world is so uneducated and some people have to assume we're 'brainwashed' because they have different views to us, people like that always need to be in the right and they hardly ever are. if someone's ever being transphobic/homophobic to you just remember that you're smarter than them because you know you can't dictate someone's life and change their views because yours are different.

i'm sorry you had experience that, one day people will learn. even if they don't they'll be dead soon anyway because life's not long enough to spread hate to people who don't deserve it and live a good life at the same time <3
The post was right above this one it’s been locked now thank god.
I feel you ive gone back into the closet more times then i can count but theres a reason i never stay in the closet. This is who i am i cant change that and i cant hide that I can pretend im something else but pretending can only last so long. You arent alone and people are growing more open minded everyday, hold on to hope my friend
The thing is, other people’s opinions of who we are and how much worth we have as people is really only our problem in terms of safety. (And that’s a valid, real, stupid, shitty problem!) 

Other people can think what they want. It doesn’t make us any less us, any less human, any less valid, any less worthy of existing, and existing honestly.

Other people’s opinions are their problem. They are not facts. They are not truth. They are neurons firing in someone else’s head. That’s it.

What other people *do* matters to us, because, again, safety and such, but the only thing someone else’s bigotry means is that their head is a sad, lonely, narrow, fearful place to live. 

No other person can  take your identity away. They do not have that power. Screw ‘em.
I get that. I feel the same.
Just want to say, if you like your therapist and feel comfortable with them, they should honestly be the safest person to share your identity with. If you don’t feel safe sharing with your therapist, you should search for a new therapist bc that means they’re not a good fit for you. If you don’t feel safe sharing your identity with your therapist, I’m guessing there are other things you feel you can’t share with them, and that space should be a holy space for you in a sense to be able to fully open up without fear of judgment. If they aren’t able to provide a safe space for you, then please please leave that therapist!

On the flip side, if your therapist is someone you feel safe with and like you can open up but you are just nervous of how they would respond. Please know that a good therapist will support you fully and would feel proud of you for sharing with them something that has such personal meaning to you. If they don’t react with love and support, they’re a bad therapist. Period. 

I hope the best for you! You’re not alone ❤️
Saw that post on the front page, thought it was from in here, realized it was just on askreddit, and knew I'd be reading about the fallout from it in here all day.  I'm glad I was able to not open that thread.  


We don't need their permission.  I personally could never fit back into the closet and I definitely just pass as cis most of the time. We are who we are and it's entirely lovely.
Online hate is a numbers game. There are people out there who want to have the feeling that

1. they can gang up on a minority, and
2. they can experience the feeling of actively hurting people.

They will not pick a minority that is too big (Allies included) because then there is too much backlash. They don't pick a minority that is too small or self-assured, because there will not be enough hurt reactions. 

The online hate says zero about our worth. The enby and trans community is currently in the Hater-Sweet-Spot, number wise. Not too big and not too small, and therefore a good target for pathetic little shites who like hurting people.

I don't interact with those posts or comments at all. I don't even give them the honour of acknowledge their existence with a downvote. If there is as much as a whiff of bad faith or enby/transphobia ... cricket noise.Better to put the time and energy into building community and connecting with like-minded people. Please do not feel bad about looking down the abbys, sometimes doing that kind of stuff has a weird morbid pull. But know that it says literally zero about your worth.
I was a curious cat, but after reading one comment I headed your advice and Noord out of there...

As long as we love ourselves and have good people around us though it doesn't much matter what some dumb people on the internet think 💜
I’ve made the mistake of crawling in that rabbit hole several times. I feel you, fellow human. Sending hugs 💞🫶🏽
Stuff online tends to be more toxic than real life. Most people don’t care so you hear more from a minority of extremists.

Sorry you’re feeling awful. You are loved, and valid stay strong, and stay safe.
I love you for who you are kind stranger ❤️
transphobia is literally inescapable on the internet right now, doesn’t matter what platform every time i open my phone there’s some fresh digital self harm waiting for me. i’ve grown pretty numb to it honestly, my best advice for you is to spend less time online.
We're here in your boat, seeing and feeling a lot of the same things. You are not alone. I try to remember that being out and standing up for the enby community isn't just for me-- it's for everyone out there who needs to hear our voices and know they aren't alone. 💜
That sucks to hear, but don't worry people will still back you up! Queer people on the internet have to come from somewhere so greetings.
For anyone else who comes across transphobia on Reddit, in my experience reporting those comments actually works, unlike on other social media platforms. I’ve gotten lots of transphobic comments removed by reporting them. It’s takes some work of course but it’s very healing when they get removed. So sorry you had to experience this, OP. ❤️
i simply do not listen to cis people's thoughts or opinions on trans people :3 aside from the ones who take the time to learn about us, most cis ppl in my experience are not only uneducated but are also somehow proud of their ignorance as if it's a flex to be like ""hur dur I'm too dumb to understand trans and unwilling to learn, that makes me edgy and cool!!!""

I wouldn't entertain the opinions of a racist or a sexist just because their bigotry is ignorant and not outright malicious and the same goes for transphobes they can piss off :D
Thank you very much, I truly appreciate it. You're not a failure or a coward and you can take as much time as you need to come out. I hope you don't have to get misgendered anymore soon.

Aw, thank you, that's very sweet to hear. You too, you know, I'm sure many people here have had stories of coming out at work. Maybe hearing others' experiences can help make it less intimidating?
Passed an upvote. In our heart of hearts, we all know it's true. We have to pay no mind to the ignorant, they'll have to come around eventually the more visible we are, as hard as it is. Once it's their friend, their cousin, their favorite parsib, hopefully they'll see that we're just people like them, and maybe then they'll listen to us instead of thoughtlessly dismiss.
Thank you friend I needed to hear this, they can’t stand us feeling confident in ourselves
I forgot to respond to this! Thank you, friend, you're very right. I appreciate this and I look up to your confidence, hope you're having a lovely day.
Me too, I choose to remain hopeful. Thank you for your kindness.
I have that same hope aswell. All the anti-trans rhetoric being used right now, is basically the same as the anti-gay ""arguments"" being used in the 70s and 80s. In a few decades, these things will hopefully die down, and people will get used to us, and accept us
It’s a disgustingly common mindset. Some people in some sort of disadvantaged or minority group will seek rights and equality but only for themselves and those above them. It’s like terfs. Yeah they’re for gender equality but only if you’re cis.
It's very disturbing when people- even after they've  gone through hate, prejudice and discrimination as a group and individuals,- believe and say these things. 

The lack of awareness, the complete lack of irony in their words: ""flavour of the month"" it is so similar to- past and sometimes present still- attitudes towards bisexuality: that NB and trans is merely a 'phase' to grow out of, a type of denial or a coping mechanism for prejudice, a need to 'choose' a side, attention seeking, damaging to the queer cause- all of this is what people were openly saying about bisexuality- even people who considered themselves Liberal (like my mother and her uni friends), when I was growing up as a teenager in the 2000s. 

Years ago I saw society as a march of progress, but from these attitudes you can see exactly why history repeats itself in the worst way. 

...
Sadly, it is the mindset of some cis gay and bi folk, since they have become so much more accepted, that they have to throw the trans people under the bus, just to get approval from straights
Wow! That is so hurtful and cruel. I'm bisexual and consider it important to my identity too, I cannot believe someone in the community could say that. Of course, I mean that rhetorically, ignorance and hatred knows no gender nor sexuality. That person should be ashamed of themselves.

Respectibility politics are one of the worst things to happen to our communities. If they're so ashamed to be seen next to us, they should go ahead and make their own trans-exclusive community, they just shouldn't be surprised when the only people who choose to stand with them are other hate-filled bigots who will turn on them eventually too.

I can use my identity to elevate my argument too. I'm bisexual and I say do not listen to these fools!
Seriously! In a way I couldn't believe my eyes, it was like their understanding of non-binary people hadn't evolved one bit from half a decade ago.

You're right with that, thank you.
Thank you, I appreciate the encouragement. I actually got a hate comment when I first posted this and weirdly enough, scrolling through that guy's post history was so bizarre that I actually feel better. Transphobes just can't help but make themselves look like complete asses to the general public.
That's true. What I find most frustrating is when they say it's hard to understand or when they spread misconceptions. It's not that hard to listen to us when we explain it, you know? They don't even have to ask, they could just take 10 minutes out of their day to read the long and detailed responses non-binary people have already given to the numerous questions we're asked on Reddit alone.

That's true about waiting for acceptance though. I do wish the world was better, at least there are people who understand, which can be better than one can ask for. I appreciate the well thought-out response. It gives me a healthier perspective on things.
The idea of not fitting into a proscribed gender role making you not actually that gender is incredibly sexist. Gender isn’t about roles, GNC people exist and always have. Non-binary is far deeper than that, literally not being a man or woman. Plenty of nonbinary people are very feminine, does that make them women?
Thank you, friend. Your comment gave me a laugh, I truly do appreciate it. I will make sure to do that.
You're right, thank you. I just wish one day that even in 'normal' posts, AKA ones outside of LGBTQ+ communities, that everyone would be accepting and kind towards us that they are/used to be with sexual orientations. I see more homophobia recently too though. It makes me sad because it felt like we were truly progressing for a little while.

Thank you, your points make a lot of sense and give me something to ponder, you're right. I will try not to going forward. Thank you for taking the time to help me, I truly appreciate it.
Didn't even know it was a type of self-harm. I need to stop doing it ASAP, because I've been purposefully looking at mean comments, just to ""laugh"" at it. It doesn't even benefit me in any way, it's just become habit, for when I'm bored :(
I appreciate it, but even so, I just can't take the risk. I keep worrying that it'll change our relationship forever. I'll think about it, maybe in the future. My identity is not a big source of worries at the moment, it's just who I am.

I hope you get to come out fully eventually, if it's safe to do so. Where I am, it unfortunately isn't, but it's okay. I'm so lucky to be able to meet other people like me at all, even if it's through the anonymity of the internet.

Thank you so much.
This gave me some perspective, it's easy to focus on the negative, but indeed, there were many people who sought to educate themselves and understand us better. I truly appreciate each and every one of those people.
Im sorry that mod was such a jerk to you it sucks when people abuse their power
I'm very sorry that happened to you, my friend, that is horrible. As someone from a non-white culture, many accusations are thrown against us about how we're 'brainwashed' by the progressive white/western/European countries. It's so harmful and not spoken about enough. Non-binary isn't an identity that belongs to one culture or 'came from' western countries. Historically, it was western countries that wiped out non-binary identities and insisted on a rigid gender binary anyway. It is so insulting.
Thank you, that's true. I will remember that, I'm unfortunately a naturally curious person, but it's not impossible for me to override that when I know it's a post meant to sow discord and hatred between us and the cis.
That's what happens when delivery drivers are held to unreasonable standards that don't account for anything out of the ordinary.  Doesn't make it right of course, but some poor delivery driver risks being punished because you ""took too long to answer the door"" 😢
Thank you, kind friend, I truly appreciate your and everyone else's support and understanding. I hope you're feeling better, those people don't deserve to bring you down.
I'm sorry to hear. I hope things get better for you and for us all. Treat yourself to something nice if you can. We all deserve it for having to put up with this.
I'm so sorry that happened to you, you did nothing wrong. People see us and react impulsively, they would rather us be invisible. It's awful.

Thank you sincerely, my friend, I will not.
Thank you so much, I agree with you. I just wish they would hear us out, that's really all I want. They seem to carry weird stereotypes about us that I have no doubt they've heard from other people and not from our community. Even if someone doesn't understand, they could just mind their own business instead of disparage us like that. Just completely unnecessary hatred, in my opinion.

Thank you. I hope people will understand one day too.
Seriously? I'm glad it's been locked. What a horrible thread, I just can't imagine asking that, knowing the current climate the internet is in.
I'm sorry to hear that, you're correct, it's who we are. I'm glad you're no longer in the closet. I hope your days are happy and peaceful. I will choose to hold onto hope.
Thank you, my friend. You're right and I appreciate the perspective, it means a lot. Screw 'em, haha.
I'm so sorry to hear. I hope your days get better, you deserve better. We all do.
Thank you, kind friend. I appreciate your support. Maybe some day. I have only recently come to terms with my identity and the current climate on trans rights, or lack thereof, has gotten me nervous. I hope things get better for us soon.
I felt the same. Good work on not opening the thread, they don't deserve our engagement. You're right, thank you for your kind support.
You're right, this gave me a lot to think about. Thank you for helping me rationalize this. I hope our community will be out and proud enough in the future that we'll be largely left alone. Openly non-binary celebrities and characters give me hope, they normalize us to cis people.

Thank you very much.
You're right, you did the right thing by hightailing it out of there. That place is a desolate wasteland. Thank you, friend, hope your day is going well.
I hope you're feeling okay now.
Yeah but that minority is obviously loud enough to still be putting our lives in danger
Thank you, kind friend. I will, I appreciate your words.
Thank you so much, my friend. I will always support you and our entire community too.
That's a good idea. I don't seek out hatred and actively try to avoid it, but it seems even positive posts get bigots in the comments spouting hatred, it really gets me down.

'Digital self harm,' that's a good term, I think that's what I used to do. Only I would force myself to watch tragic documentaries and news stories because I felt like I had to witness people's suffering or else no one would remember them. Obviously it's good to stay informed, but not to the extent I did it. You can't help people if you're too miserable, of course.
It's for you too, my friend. You're a brave person, and brave people deserve the reward of their kindness being returned to them. I hope you're doing well today. You're not alone either, thank you for your caring words.
 Thank you so much for your kindness and support.
I agree with Sauron, which is probably a product of his mind bending rings of power, but I'm gonna pretend like it's my free will. Lol Lord of the Rings jokes aside, he has a point. A lot of folks get online to troll and say hateful things about people, but wouldn't actually act on it in reality. That's the double edged sword of the internet - the anonymity to trash talk, with few consequences from doing it.

I openly wear dresses, skirts and jean shorts with blouses and tank tops. Ive also been in jujitsu and kickboxing for 20 some odd years now, and I've read up on the self defense laws in my state. I've gotten sneers and a few disgusted looks at the worst, but I generally walk around like I own the roads, the sidewalks, and the car they drove in with.

It isn't the easiest to ignore people like that, but it's the best for your mental health. We have supporters, we have allies, and we can build castles with the bricks they throw at us.

Stay strong, friend 🙏🏾💪🏾
Thank you, I hope you have a lovely day too!
it can be hard but we can only try our best
It's like ""hey look at me majority, I'm cool like you, I also hate the even more minor minority! Please accept me!""
They have nothing going on in their lives and choose to spend their time engaging in the same behaviors as everyone else who is brainwashed by cisheteronormativity.
I really genuinely believe no matter how anyone explains it it will still be hard for people to grasp. I feel like some of this stems from the fact that many of the non binary people I know are on the spectrum. In fact I don't think I've met a non binary person who wasn't. Being on the spectrum gives people a perspective that many ""neurotips"" can't grasp anyway.

 It gives me a sense of empathy to them but it also disappoints me. I really wish it was easy for people to grasp but many cis people have never questioned their gender at all. They just accept that they are that without having any true draw to the ""meaning"" of being that. Understanding the discomfort of being seen in a particular way is something that has never been seen as an option to them. 

I've always assumed that there are far more bisexual people who just never realized they have options/ are influenced by social stigma and I feel the same way about being non binary. Many people have just never taken the time to feel out if they connect at all with the identity placed upon them. If they are what they have been told they are.
I agree with you. I don't think Grey meant it like that though, some people accidentally say gender role instead of just gender or gender identity, but you're right that it's a dangerous misconception that people use to judge us.

I like to think of gender presentation and gender identity as two different things. Well, they are, but when I explain it that way to cis people, they seem to understand it better. But regardless, thanks for the clarification for onlookers.

I grow really annoyed when cis people are like, ""Oh, you don't like girly things so you think you're non-binary? That's sexist."" Then someone says they do like girly things or still present feminine and they're like, ""You're not non-binary, look at how feminine you are, you're just a cis woman trying to be special.""

The main reason I'm non-binary is because being seen as a woman makes me dysphoric. I don't think a cis woman has to hype herself up for 10 minutes just to do the dreadful task of saying she identifies as a woman — then backing out anyway. I don't think a cis woman feels a sinking pit of dread at being called she or Miss.
Glad I made you smile - I know it’s overwhelming and terrifying, OP, but you can’t change that. You can vote and protest and argue and educate, but some people can’t be taught. We can’t change how others think - we can only change how we think, and overwhelming yourself will never help. Shine on, you crazy diamond, and have a lovely day.
Thank you so much for saying so. I wasn't the only trans person who left because of it I've found out.
The thing is though, how out of the ordinary is it? There are millions of physically disabled people in my country- apparently over 14 million listed as 'disabled', although that doesn't give much clue as to how. Of course that's only those registered as disabled. Aaccording to a statistic for the US, rather than the UK, 11.1% of people live with a 'serious' mobility impairment. Note: serious. This is only including people with a long term disability, not including those with short term injury and illness.
Also, over 11 million  people are over 65- of which many will begin to lose mobility.

So from these figures it shouldn't be seen as anything out of the ordinary. And of course there are so many different households- many are in blocks of flats, so how realistically is it going to be that it's a straightforward job every time? It's more to do with the expectations of outdated suburban norms that don't realistically relflect households today, and with that any excuse by large companies to 'expect' a delivery to take as little time as possible- and so for the employee to be at fault if it doesn't. It was absolutely right that Amazon expanded its special delivery instructions/options, although for all of its wrongs when it comes to the treatment of it's employees- having to piss in water bottles etc- I'd worry that any extra time needed, even when known about  beforehand won't be taken into account for the employees. 

But, as said, none of these situations are out of the ordinary (let alone anomalous) but should be rightfully regarded as normal as, say, disabled toilets- I doubt either of those men would have had the balls to try to say that they were unwarranted. I doubt they were thinking about the employees, rather they possess in common an aversion to anything they see as different and somehow threatening to their sense of normality, or God forbid, 'lesser' people having rights and dignity.
Yup. Instead of…idk…deleting the post the op made 3 edits asking the mods to lock the thread. It’s one thing if they were commenting that on someone else’s thread they had no control over but they could’ve easily just deleted it.
Thanks, the word will get better eventually
Entirely understand the anxiety. It’s a heavy weight. Best of luck to you ❤️
Thank you too. you sound like a lovely person \^\_\^
I’ve been attacked by a guy with a machete for being trans so I do understand even one person can be dangerous. Still I have had many more positive experiences since coming out. Life is definitely more dangerous for me now but I’d say it’s been worth it.
Thank you for the reminder. Iowa is a boat that is sinking fast for the LGBTQ+ community, so I'm grateful for communities like this that remind me that I'm not alone. Hugs to you.
Thanks friend I needed this positivity this afternoon. Be safe and keep being you ❤️🖤
Honestly, when they're so persistent like that, it's hard to take them seriously. Like damn, are you working round the clock for this?
Is that so? Personally, I never saw a correlation, but I'm not on the spectrum myself. All I know is that neurodivergent people are more likely to be xenogender and use neopronouns, not necessarily just be non-binary.

While I understand your empathy, I've known plenty of neurotypical or cis people who could understand the concept of non-binary, I feel like it's not a valid excuse. They should be trying to understand us better before speaking about us. If they don't want to, then they should simply respect us and bow out of speaking about us like they have any sort of authority on the matter, you know? I appreciate your perspective, but I will have to disagree there that they can't understand it. I think they just need to open their minds more.

But yes, I agree with the last part, I'm sure there's a lot of bisexual and non-binary people who never questioned it because the discomfort wasn't large enough to do anything about it.
That subreddit wasnt cool enough for yall anyway
Maybe I misunderstood, I thought it was a driver who said it.
My point was that the internet being more “toxic” than irl bc of the minority of these extremist being the loudest is false. Online it’s impossible to be physically violent bc it’s…well…not physical. I’m not going to be killed online for being a minority. Irl tho that possibility is high and rampant. The toxic shit on the internet is amplified by the ability to genuinely act upon the toxicity.
Its true, I knew somebody who modded for a small site and she said one day she spent literally all day banning the same person. 😂 they kept coming back
As far as I know, it wasn't. At least, they didn't volunteer that information. From what one of them said I'd suspect maybe not as they referred to drivers as 'them'as opposed to 'us or we'. Of course the problem isn't the delivery drivers themselves as they can't be expected to differentiate between someone disabled or physically frail etc vs someone who's not in or just not answering the door etc when they've no opportunity to receive the information and they're being told to take the least amount of time possible at threat to their wages, even jobs etc. This is especially true in blocks of flats or housing of multiple occupation etc where there will be less likely the option of a safe place or a place to display information etc
I was assaulted before transitioning too.  Real life is just inherently more dangerous. Depends on where you live but honestly being online is more damaging to my mental health than going outside. You can still definitely be harmed online too. Doxing, swatting, and other real harm are possible consequences. Trans people have died because of actions taken by people online.
Wow, that's bizarre! Especially with all the communities one can easily find online, I don't understand trying to brute force your way into one that's already banned you.
Doxxing is inherently harmless unless action is taken from it (which..Yk…happens irl). Trans people being killed is…again…an in real life thing. I don’t think you’re realizing that the two are intertwined. I genuinely hope you didn’t mean the first sentence as way to play of hate crimes bc crimes happen to everyone…
I mean saying it is inherently harmless is false unless you only believe physical violence counts as harm. That’s my point you aren’t safe in real life ever, and hatred is amplified online. So the hate you see directed at you online isn’t representative of real life.

Thanks 😊👍
Yes you’re exactly right. Hatred is amplified online. Violence from online is amplified irl. You can not seriously compare the two and call one more “toxic” than the other. The internet is toxic. Irl if toxic.
Like you said everyone can be a victim of a hate crime or just violence in general. Being online is more toxic than real life, it isn’t a good indicator of what to expect from people you will meet in person. While you might be attacked in real life for being non-binary you aren’t safe by being closeted. Your assumed experiences offline cannot be based off of your experiences online.

Like I’m sure you’re a nice person in real life 😊
Everyone being a possible victim further proves my point wdym 😭. Irl is incredibly dangerous and incredibly toxic. Everyone can be a possible victim online too. Like I said neither is more toxic than the other. Irl and online are toxic for different reasons. Harm done online isn’t any worse than irl and vice versa.
I think the entirety of this interaction between us has proven my point.
Yes…bc us talking about which is worse (Yk without insulting one another, throwing around threats, etc…) is more toxic than something like this instead being turned into a fight. I 100% agree. You have a fantastic day and I suggest stepping away from the toxicity for a bit 🥰
This has definitely done more harm to me than the time I was threatened with violence at a drug store. I’d rather be called a hermaphrodite by that guy again than continue this conversation.

Seriously not as any kind of joke but I was suicidal at 15 because of the depictions of trans people in the media, and online. I was more dangerous to myself than any of the people who have assaulted me.

So I won’t be responding any further but I’m sure if we had met in real life any interaction we would have been more positive than this 👋"	11e4pk5	NonBinary	401	0.99	2023-02-28 12:21:24
When the dysphoria fades away ✨		"On god how I'm tryna be

You look absolutely amazing! I love your makeup!

That's great !!!!
Fabulous
I'm obsessed with your necklace you wear it so well!
Oh my god you look stunning!💖  Giving me some hope lol
Cool makeup.
Heart on the cheek giving bad bitch electra heart vibes
Haha its a journey for sure ❤️
I did not google before posting. I have since done a google and learned that beard glitter is in fact a thing that exists. Yay
Made my day 😍
Gurl saaaaaaammmeee
Hahaha that's awesome I didn't know they made something specifically for beards! I just use a dark eyeshadow tinged with a highlight and glitter to fill out the beard and make it more uniform and gayer, which is all I want"	fckwg0	NonBinary	385	0.99	2020-03-02 23:09:09
Just an insta filter but it helps with dysphoria		"You're prettiness is making me feel cute!
An insta filter today,  the real deal soon hopefully x
It's cute and you're cute! I love it 💜
You are so cute tho! Your hair ugh 😩You look great
You have such pretty eyes.  Also, i think you would look really cute in blue and gold makeup.
the eyeliner really makes ur eye color pop! its v pretty
You are beautiful :) I don’t know what that look is but I’m digging it.
Your pigtails are so cute!!
Purdy
You look cute
I don’t know which filter this is but it’s lovely! After I started wearing makeup and shaping my beard for built in contouring I felt so euphoric. I hope it does wonderful things for your self empowerment like it did mine. Pro tip: buy a gel felt tip eyeliner pen to get that clean eye look from the filter. Revlon colorstay liquid eyeliner pen is a good starter item and it comes in several tip shapes for different effects, the classic shape is easy to use and you get good product flow. (I tried using conventional grease pencil and liquid eyeliner when I was first starting out and it was a fiasco.) and I second what one of the other posters said get gold eyeshadow, maybe a pot of cream eyeshadow, it’s so much richer than powder. I recommend ‘Maybelline Color Tattoo 24 hour cream gel eye shadow’ in “Bold Gold” it’s densely pigmented, inexpensive, you can get it at nearly any drugstore, and it wears like a dream. It’ll look really nice with your skin tone and complexion. (Also your earrings are everything)
You are cute 🥰, thank you!
For sure! Just got my first eyeliner & mascara today 🥰
Thank you ❤️❤️
🥰🥰 aww thank you!!❤️❤️
Thank you! I have to try that, I’m realllly new to makeup but excited to try new things
Thank you! 🥰
🥺 thank you!
🥺 thank you!!
🥰
Thank you 😊
Wow, thank you so much!! Like seriously I need major help in finding which products might work for me so I really appreciate this friend!
woohoo! you look fabulous 🥰
Anytime! I know I struggled trying to find stuff that worked for me in the beginning. Like anything worth doing it’s a perpetual work in progress, but once you try a few products you’ll start to feel less scared to experiment with your look. I’m so excited for you! 🖤🖤🖤

Dysphoria is kicking my ass today but Renny needs a new bag so a new bag they shall get. (P.s hi, this is my face)		"Don't answer if you're not comfortable with it, but what is it you're feeling dysphoric about?

You look great and read quite andro. Not saying that's incompatible with feeling dysphoric, because it isn't at all, just curious.
Look amazing 💕 kick your dysphoria and sadness’s ass you got this 💕💕💕💕
Secure that bag.  Hopefully the dysphoria quiets down some. 
hey i’m sorry dysphoria is being a bitch - from one nb to another, i think u look stunning ! 💓
Love. 
You have wonderful eyebrows.
You look great! Dysphoria is awful and it takes a lot out of you but you're still here and still kicking ass yourself! I believe in you :) 
Hi! 

Honestly it's a social thing, I was out last night with folks who don't know my situation so it was hour of misgendering and wrong pronouns and wrong name (which is entirely not their fault cos they didn't know) and idk it just got to me a bit. 

Thank you though! 
Thanks! Me too 
Thanks hun! 💓💓
Aaaaa really?? They are sooo uncontrollable 
Thanks bud!!! 
Ahhh okay... Welp, sorry about that. But hey at least you look great.
I've been depressed and mostly unable to get out of my apartment for several months now. Last week I started volunteering at my local food bank, to give myself a reason to be productive and get out of this funk. A lot of the volunteers are boomers, and I got a whole lot of ""he/him"" and ""hey, can you lift this? I need a BIG STRONG MAN to help me out!"" I'm happy to help, and I recognize that they don't know better, but gosh that can be jarring.
Oh, yeah, that's the worst. I haven't come out to my extended friend group either. It's rough 😣 
If they look good leave them be.
Thanks buddy! 
Hey buddy it's tough, I know, but we can do this!! Even if the folks around us don't understand, there are people in the world who do, like here, and other places, you're valid. 

Proud of you for getting up and out though! Helping yourself and other people, that's really cool. 
One day we'll be brave enough too! "	af6vqh	NonBinary	375	1.0	2019-01-12 12:15:02
Therapist consistently misgendering me?	"Basically the title.

I'm nonbinary, I've made it clear I use they/them pronouns. When they first called me to get my information, they asked for my pronouns. They know what my pronouns are, and they're established as an LGBT friendly therapist (which they certainly are! Aside from this. No issues about me being ace/aro or being in a queerplatonic relationship)

But they still call me she/her when talking to me in third person. 

I even had the courage to stop them once and remind them that I don't use she/her. In fact, anything non feminine is fine. They encouraged me for setting boundaries, and used they/them for about five minutes before slipping back into she/her.

When I talked about being nonbinary again, and that I go by they/them pronouns (summed up by ""I don't want to be a boy, but I hate being a girl"") they asked if I knew that they/them referred to multiple people. 

They're totally fine with my plan to get top surgery though. I'm just very confused and think they might not understand what being trans or nonbinary means, but I don't quite have the energy or nerve to keep correcting them after doing so already.

I'm wondering if other people have the same experience I guess? I suppose I can understand it would be very easy to forget around me, I try not to be feminine but my voice gives it away.

One of the reasons I'm seeing them is *because* of Gender dysphoria

I'm not sure if I should seek someone else out, or suck it up and bring it up again, or just let it slide."	"If this therapist isn't helping you the way you need, don't hesitate to drop them. Therapy is too expensive to not get what you deserve.
You should try and find someone else. You aren't asking for something big for them to respect your pronouns. I found a lot of folks were comfortable listing LGBT friendly, but really meant LGB. You shouldn't have to 'let it slide' when it comes to getting care about something that means a lot to you.   
Thinking of you.
Even if this person is otherwise kind and helpful, and on board to help you get top surgery, they may still have a lot of learning to do where pronouns are concerned, and you’re well within your rights to switch to someone further along in their understanding. If they’re a good therapist, they’ll understand that they aren’t a good fit for you and that you need someone who won’t misgender you, even accidentally.
""they/them referred to multiple people""

isn't that not entirely correct even if you don't consider people who use they/them as their pronouns anyway though?
I found a nonbinary therapist explicitly for this reason. Not to say a cis therapist is incapable of respecting pronouns (ive had good experiencs w cis therapists too), but it does sort of garuntee they'll have a better immediate understanding if they are also nonbinary/trans. I look up almost all of my providers on the WPATH directory search, which means they have a certification on transgender health standards of care.
Yikes that's frustrating. Like others have said, you're paying too much to be this therapist's learning experience. There are plenty of LGBT friendly therapists that actually include the T. I see one via telehealth and she's great. She makes mistakes occasionally, but in the three years I've been seeing her I can count them on one hand. Good luck! I hope you're able to find someone that you don't have to fight with to be recognized as who you are.
I found myself in the same boat as you. I had an LGBT friendly therapist and he kept misgendering me. Every time he did I corrected him and he apologized, but I had enough after the 5th time. It definitely made me feel alienated in my own therapy session and I felt I couldn't build a relationship with the therapist because of this. I stopped him point blank mid session and said that we were done. I told him why, outlined the importance of pronouns, grilled him about what trans education he had (which might have been overkill), and said bye. I shook his hand when I left and it was sweaty as hell. ""Good,"" I thought.

As others have said, find a different therapist. To have a good therapist you need to build a relationship on trust and respect - you can't have one without the other, and not using your pronouns is disrespectful.
Yup new therapist time 

Edit: i use they them and have 2 therapists both cis and neither has any problems using my pronouns
You deserve to have a therapist who affirms you. It doesn’t sound like this one can do that. You’ve brought it up enough times. If they acknowledged you for setting that boundary, they should also realize they’re crossing it. A therapist is supposed to create a safe relationship container focused on your needs. It would be very reasonable to leave this one for not meeting your needs.
I had something similar happen. Noted my pronouns in the paperwork. She misgendered me in the first session. I brought up my pronouns thinking she probably just didn't see them on the paperwork. She pauses for a moment and says ""ok"" then goes on a rant about how it's grammatically incorrect. I dropped her and started seeing a trans therapist after that with no issue.
I’m trying to think of any time a therapist has had to refer to me as if they were talking to someone else and… that has never happened.

I am trying to figure out if or why your therapist decides to talk as if they are not talking to you (unless you have therapy with someone else/they are actually talking to someone else).

That just seems like misgendering on purpose by adding an invisible third person to double it down, adding the false idea that they is just for plural just solidifies that.
mine does the same thing :/ feels like shit im sorry
I had a therapist who did the same thing my first session. It felt so degrading, I didn’t go back to that therapist again and told the clinic exactly why I wouldn’t be returning. That is not acceptable to misgender someone in therapy.
I understand how frustrating that is.

When i came out as nb, i had told my then therapist that a lot of my family basically rejected me and refused to use my name. I told her i cut them off because they were disrespectful to me.

She said maybe my name was an ""agree to disagree"" topic and basically that i shouldn't let it damage the relationship.

My experience is a little different but i get how the crossing of boundaries is upsetting.
Therapists are meant to be professionals. They aren't your friend or your irrirating relative who doesn't understand singular they, all the while casually and obliviously using it in daily life. Nevermind that any therapist worth their salt understands the harm invalidating a person's identity on a consistent basis can do. Misgendering is Trans Mental Healthcare 101. 

If your therapist can't even manage to use your pronouns correctly, what the hell are they being paid for? Did someone forget to tell them what the T in LGBT stands for?
>*…they asked if I knew that they/them referred to multiple people…*

Wow, mega cringe. [Maybe try asking them if they know that *you* is actually the plural form of *thou*? ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/why-did-we-stop-using-thou) Then make it extra spicy and request that she go ahead and defer to *thou/thee* for talking to you from now one, since that’s objective singular and she seems to get too confused using plurals.

Hope the article brings you a bit of cheer. Anyone who is bucking back at the use of “they” being objective singular in modern English really needs to just grow up. But if they want to have a battle on etymology and semantics then, let’s not let them down mm? ;) You got this OP.


edit:  Also yes, get a new therapist that is genderqueer friendly. :)

edit 2:  Some edits for clarity
It doesn’t sound like they are being maliciously disrespectful. 

It also sounds like they have more biases to work through in this area, than they seem to be aware of.

It is perfectly reasonable to place a boundary in this area. For example you could say something like the following:

“I am questioning whether this can be a safe enough space for me to continue therapy, while I continue to be misgendered. 

I find it _____ (triggering) and _______ (disrespectful). It feels like it’s getting in the way of my progress, or is actively harmful. 

I appreciate that you may already be doing your best. 

Do you have any thoughts on the subject? Do you feel like we may be able to find a solution that allows me to feel more safe? “
Ugh this is brutal. How to decide whether to stay with a therapist who is good in many ways bit dehumanizing in others? It's hard enough to find a good therapist as it is.

In a perfect world, I would say ditch them. Misgendering is not okay and they don't seem to care that they're hurting you. But in *this* world, it might be worth it to see who else you can find first?

It also sounds like they could use some education on pronouns and trans issues.
They/them can be used to refer to multiple people but has been used as gender neutral pronoun for centuries
This infuriating. If possible, you have to try to move onto someone else. This individual obviously needs more education, but that is *not your job right now*, especially since you are being directly affected by their conduct, THEY are the professional, and you need support that is directly related to your gender identity. If possible, please try to find another therapist. Sorry you have to go through this.
A therapist isn’t someone you should correct in these terms. If it’s not working then go for another one is my advise, that won’t ever help, if anything it makes for weird confused feelings
A bad therapist is worse than no therapist!!
I had a therapist just like this once, it turned out her not being able to understand or respect my gender identity was incompatible with healing. Its time to leave and get a new one.
You are not there to train your therapist. Please find a new one, dear.
You need a different therapist. It's very unprofessional of them to be uneducated about trans people at this point
Maybe mention to them that the singular form of they has been correct since 1375 :)

And maybe tell them that “you” was originally supposed to be plural, and that they should only use “thou” when talking to one person if they care so much about what’s “really” correct for singular vs plural pronouns
I’ve had to drop my psychiatrist for this very reason (though she also couldn’t seem to get on board with my name change, even though she only knew me as my dead name for literally ONE session). You deserve to be respected, especially by someone in the mental health field who should know better
If an LGBT friendly therapist asks you if you know they/them is for multiple people ESPECIALLY after establishing pronons, they are not LGBT friendly.

Im sorry for our experience, and I hope you can find a new therapist who doesnt contribute to the problem you are seeing them to help work through.
LGBT friendly my ass. How you gonna train in LGBT issues and not have heard people use ""they/them"" before. It's like, common knowledge
Woah I did not expect this to get the attention that it has! Thank you so much everyone, I'll definitely be bringing this up to my therapist. I hope this entire page can help and reinforce said help for anyone else who finds themself in this situation.
Confront them! Big time. ""You know I have this problem where people I'm relying on still misgender me. It really hurts, even though they're trying to be supporting me they call me she. Specifically you. How do I get you to stop?""

It's super forward and aggressive but you are paying this person to at LEAST not make it worse.
!new therapist time! (if possible, it can be hard with healthcare and finances) if you can’t get a new therapist, you may have to educate them by sending them some posts/articles about non-binary and gender queerness, but this is not your responsibility and it is on them to educate themselves to be a good therapist. this is also something you should suggest to them if you feel they may respond well and won’t remove you as a patient (again, healthcare)
I had a therapist who would do the same thing. I ended up going to a younger therapist who specialises in young adults, even though I’m in my 30’s. She took me on because she recognized that a lot of my issues intersected with her other patients.
It’s up to you to decide how important it is to you to be addressed correctly. My stance on it would be to keep pushing. Send them resources that educate them on nb ppl and grammatical correctness for they/them pronouns (for that second one the brainpop discussing pronouns should work if you have access to that) In the meantime, I wish you luck <3
Alrighty yep, it's time to move on.  
I explained how I hate being referred to as a girl and that it's getting worse- they said to be mindful of the people referring to me as a girl.   
Then called me lady and ma'am during the meeting. Also used the term   
transvestite.  
I think I'll be switching to a gender therapist even if it means I have   
to go completely virtual.
Oh that does put it into perspective. My therapy is covered thankfully, but it certainly hasn't been doing me any wonders. Thanks!
this is your answer right here. 
 
therapists are tending to peoples' needs, as anyone in healthcare is. if that service isn't giving you what you need, look elsewhere for assistance. 
 
your emotional & mental wellbeing is far too important to give someone your time if they aren't adding anything positive to your existence...& that goes for much more than just therapy, as well...
Thank you for the feedback! I've noticed Psychology Today (where I was looking for therapists) often has ""LGBT friendly"", ""lesbian"" and ""bisexual"" listed specifically, but never anything else. I imagine it's all the LGBT options possible they can put, so they just put them all.

I've had some reservations about my therapist now for other reasons anyways, so I'll start looking for someone else! Probably a specifically LGBT therapist. Thanks again!
Thanks for the advice! I'll try to be upfront next time that I need them to use my pronouns. I might consider switching anyways for other reasons, but if they can make a genuine effort to correct themselves that'd be a huge improvement. Or they'll switch back to she/her and that'll answer whether or not I should look for someone else anyways.
Yeah I tried to explain it this way, ""when you find a wallet, you say, 'oh someone dropped their wallet' but you don't mean multiple dropped it. You're referring to one person"" which led to confusion over using it only when you don't know someone's gender yet, which I countered with something along the lines of ""sort of, but it's not too hard to apply that to myself with practice."" 

I'm always confused by the multiple people argument. I guess people just don't really notice how often neutral pronouns are used since they don't have any reason to think about it!
Singular they has actually been in use for longer than singular you.
Singular pronouns, have been for the last 600 years. We all learn this in our first school years.
It is a bit weird, but sometimes they try to get into the shoes of the other person, like my family, or describe me in third person. I imagine it's to show that other people don't think of me as low as I might think (won't get into all that funky stuff haha, but it's an example) or to point out things I need to work on from a narrative standpoint, which I understand, it'd just be way more tolerable with the correct pronouns. 

(of course there's also statements like ""inside you there's this wonderful ***girl""***)

Though the therapist did respond once with referring to me as ""you"" then promptly going into third person with ""she/her"" after first being reminded about the pronoun thing, so... probably a good sign for me to start looking for someone else.
I hope you found a new therapist?
It's like... I get that the few people I've told are having trouble adjusting. Saying I'm disappointed or hurt when they call me a girl doesn't mean I'm disappointed *in* them. But hearing that I should be mindful of them when that's what I've been doing this whole time stings.
And make sure you let them know why if you're comfortable with that and they give you a leaving survey. There's an opportunity for them to grow from this and learn for next time.
You are hiring them for a service and you can fire them at any time! It doesn't have to be mean or punitive, but you can discontinue services any time you like. Therapy often involves a bit of shopping around before you get someone you can work with well. Good luck in your journey!
I can only speak from my own experience. But if you’re not leaving every therapy session feeling like you were finally able to get something off your mind, or relieved, or confident, or excited, or like you’ve established a plan forward, find a new therapist.
Maybe a trans friendly one would be best? That way you know they have a deeper understanding of nonbinary/trans stuff
It can be hard to find depending on where you live. But if you can find a practice that caters primarily (or even exclusively) to transgender people, that’s your safest bet.
Ya, the singular they has been used for a long time(can be traced back to 1375), and it is endorsed as part of APA style writing. 

Btw your example makes an image of multiple people dropping their wallet pop up in my head lmao.
I, an editor, am stating that they/them is not always indicative of the plural and it has been used consistently in its singular form since the 14th century.

You can also tell your therapist on my behalf that they (singular) are transphobic when they make the decision to use pronouns that you have stated you don’t use. Respect for clients is vital for a therapeutic relationship. Their ongoing decision to misgender you makes them an unsafe contact for any trans or non-binary person. 

IMO you should make certain that the LGBTIAQ network in your area is aware that this person is unable and unwilling to correctly use your pronouns, as it shows that they are definitely NOT an ally.
Your therapist wasted your time you were paying for correcting and questioning you on your own pronouns. Drop em.
ok now I'm picturing all the ""they is for multiple people"" arguments, but it's people complaining when singular you was starting to be a thing
Yeah. Not that's pretty intentional. Like, especially with saying theres a girl inside you when you aren't a girl, no matter how you present or sound, that's messed up and transphobic honestly. It seems super intentional when you add those details to it.
Unfortunately I have not. I don't have the finances to do so.

She also crossed boundaries a few times. I had mentioned in passing that I was bisexual. She asked if i wanted to talk about it. I said no. And then she proceeded to ask if it bothered me I'd never gotten to experience being with a woman (i realized after meeting my partner).

The experience with her made me a bit cross but 🤷🏽‍♀️. I've had some great therapists and hope to find another one day.
I should mention that even though I was going mostly for gender dysphoria, they said that they knew that there's a deeper root to the problem, that if people want to change the outside of themselves it's because they haven't addressed the inside first or something.

Yeah, thanks. The inside is the gender dysphoria. I'm depressed cause I'm a girl, not a girl cause I'm depressed.
It will never not bother me that people will complain about singular they but not bat an eye at using singular you.
Yeah, and I thought it was weird that they asked for OP's pronouns, but only expected he or she? Never seen anyone ask for pronouns when they weren't even willing to use they/them
I hope you're situation changes rapidly and you're able to do so."	s0554y	NonBinary	372	1.0	2022-01-09 23:44:46
happy birthday 2 me (jus celebrated 46 recently)☺☺☺ 10 years... 48w to 28w... 4XL to M... 50%+ bf to 16% bf... and best of all? 100% to 0% gwnder dysphoria ☺🙏🌈 it jus doesn't seem real when i wake up ❤		"lol ""gender"" euphoria 🤷 btw im happy 2 share anything that might help others in this fight ❤ i didn't use surgeries or calorie counting (i *did* count macros 4 a year or 2 tho) so not much help there im afraid ☺
Good for you!  Fuck yeah.  Fuck dysphoria.  That's so awesome.
Oh lord forearm veins do things to me
I've wondered if my dysphoria would be reduced by a lot if I lost weight. I'm not even sure how to begin.
Content like this gives me the strength to go on.
I'm so so happy for you! You look absolutely radiant and dazzling and sparkly. 
Your whole self just glows! 
I'm so so excited.
How did you go about the exercising if I might ask? Did you do it at home? Gym? Personal trainer?
Trying to shape my body to help fight my dysphoria, I like hearing other people's testimonials, aside from inspiring it always helps me learn a thing or two.
Thank you!
that is incredible, well donefor getting no more dysphoria
Proud of you. But that was hard to read
i got asked a few times about my experience so ill post here ☺👇: 

400-310: i gave up all alcohol, processed foods, fast foods & white sugar. i ate anything i wanted but i had 2 cook it from scratch & i used raw sugar or honey 2 sweeten. this happened fast af like maybe 2 or 3 months.

310-260: made every possible effort 2 make activity changing choices like parking distant, using stairs, etc. this was the only time i used the gym & spent 12 months lifting and counting my macronutrient intake. this was just that year or so.

260-225: stayed active as possible & continued 2 jus stay aware of what i ate... if i was doing well, id do something new - some would work some wouldn't but its alway. i also worked with a great provider to get my thyroid & vitamin levels optimized. that was like over 6 or 7 years but i wasn't too aggressive. 

225-185: gave up white carbs (white potatoes, flours & rice yes the good stuff) pretty much gotten 2 like Greek yogurt with fruit & whole oats, squash & sweet potatoes and dark meat chicken 2 or 3 times a week (skin on bone in... the fats n collagens from the bones, cartilage and skin are great 4 u ☺). i also started HRT testosterone optimization with my provider (who is also one of my biggest advocates ❤) that's the past 2 yrs or so.

hope that satisfies some curiosity & a few ppl can find some ideas 2 make their own 👋☺🌈 if diet is ur obstacle, it's really about understanding how u personally use food in nutrition & empowering urself with that knowledge ✊
Effing goals! Go you!
All I can say is IMPRESSIVE!
Cuuuute :o
A true inspiration!!!!
lol funny u mention that 🤣 i nvr had them b4 & im finding im pretty fond of them myself 🤗
i dont know honestly ❤👭🌈 my euphoria really began when i started taking care of myself & feeling empowered 2 make a difference in my life - 2 be clear i was ~400lbs & was looking at preconditions that at my weight, at my age & with my blood lvls at the time were becoming irreversible & growing more progressive 😔

so although i enjoy the way i look these days 2 myself, i dont honestly think most ppl will find 100% of an authentic peace thru weight targets imho plus its often  largely a goal built of chance & good fortune rather - what i nvr make it about is any prerequisite of worth ❤ i feel im worth what i can offer & i don't punish myself 2 much when it comes short 🤷 i hope u find that advice worth the read tysm 4 letting me share ❤🙏
wow that's so nice of u 2 say ☺ it was a longterm and multiphase approach - i think everyone finds their ""thing"" that sticks but ill post my experience here on the thread 🤗
tysm ❤ how could i clarify better 4 u?
this is so wholesome :)
For a second I thought you had gone from 50+ boyfriends to 16 lol
🤣🤣🤣 no 'fraid not... tbh i aint even found ""1"" 🤷💔😂
I thought you went from >50% boyfriend to 16% boyfriend, which seemed also not far from accurate.
i reckon ur right hadn't thought of it that way... im technically under 50% the boyfriend i was by volume i guess but  by value i think my ex's wouldn't even have given me the 16% 🤷 hey ya, me n outkast, we're just bein' honest"	g7wtmh	NonBinary	375	0.99	2020-04-25 16:54:30

Thanks! Yeah it makes me smile and remember all the good things about being the way I am.

After months of binding everyday and making an effort to present androgynous to alleviate dysphoria I decided to test myself and present feminine to see if I could do it. I cried a little but I got more comfortable, I ended up liking my outfit and makeup✨		"Bonus points for strong goth vibes
You're a valid enby no matter how you present or look! Don't be scared to explore gender expression and gender identities, you don't have to lock one in for the rest of your life!
This outfit is amazing!!
Good look! Took me a bit to feel comfortable wearing ""feminine"" clothes myself
Course outfit! As long as you're happy! That's what's important!
You look fire! I love your outfit so much!
That whole look is super dope!
glad u feel better friend ! dont feel pressured to present a specific way, just be urself
Love yourself for who you are. You have breasts because it's part of the beauty of who and what you are.
Have you considered short hair? Might change your look.
Haha I'm a big fan of PicsArt editing ;]
You're right! I'm only just learning this :')
Thank you! <3
Ty! I'm glad you can feel comfortable wearing them now
Thank you! You're right :')
Tysm <3
Thank you! <3
Thanks for the suggestion, I think all the people who downvoted took this the wrong way. I did think about it but I'm okay with my hair the length it is
A common misconception is that non-binary is a third, united gender where androgyny is the goal and gender confusion the expression. That's not the case. Non-binary, like any other gender, is on a scale. Both women and men can be small and dainty or big built, sometimes with muscle. Both men and women can express feminine or masculine, unrelated to their sex characteristics and body build. 

Saying ""that is a woman"" tells very little how she will actually look, but we may expect stereotypes, same goes for non-binary people. Most expect the androgyny stereotypes, but like any other gender, there are a hundred ways to express it. You can be non-binary with an expression and identity close to your AGAB, or one completely opposite of your AGAB, both are equally valid identities. You don't have to seek gender affirmation theraphy as an enby to be valid, or do any changes at all, but if you want to you shouldn't be held back by being non-binary.

I hope you find the you that makes you most happy :)"	fje6uo	NonBinary	359	0.99	2020-03-16 03:19:36
I hate it when cis women do this	"I have noticed that when I (ftnb/ftm) explain that I'm trans and non binary, and I explain why I'm transitioning all cis women have to say ""well I don't totally feel like a woman either"" 
It's frustrating because my mother for example says it as a way to disregard my gender identity like we are the same just because she likes football and the color blue (even tho I don't like ""boyish"" things). 
And my nb and trans friends, with or without dysphoria, transitioning or not, don't say these things."	"I feel this. Even when they’re not trying to invalidate nonbinary/trans identities, it often feels like they’re trying to say they get it, and it’s frustrating because you know they really don’t. Because at the end of the day, cis women with “boyish” interests or aesthetics could be as masculine or “boyish” as can be, and they would still be cis because they identify with their agab. I feel like there are two separate (though interrelated) conversations at play: one about trans identities and another about social expectations for women, and cis women who make those statements think we’re having the exact same conversation.
""Well *I* have times when I don't like my body too!""

Wishing you were skinnier and less wrinkled isn't the same as feeling distressed by your primary and secondary sexual characteristics, height, voice, etc. because they impact whether or not many people treat you as sane and deserving human dignity when you try to stand up for your identity and ask to be gendered correctly, dearest MIL.
I said this A LOT as an uncracked egg, not gonna lie.   I was very deep in denial and shame, and used the excuse ""I don't feel like a woman either"" to justify my mistreatment of non binary folk and transmen.   
""How do you identify?"" Is a good question to ask when someone says these things.  If they're cis, after putting an ounce of thought into it they come around and go ""A woman, I guess..."" And many of them realize that was a silly thing to say 

If they're like me, however, you're probably gonna piss them off by asking.   I don't ""identify"" as anything, I just am a woman""
Why?
They'll give some kind of response about biology, and if you have the energy you can explain to them that gender and sex are not the same thing.  Again, this is going to piss them off.   My gender and sex are the same!! It doesn't matter that when I think about it at all, they feel completely separate and foreign from each other!! How dare you make me think about it??
And then hopefully, hopefully they'll have a realization down the road that it's not normal to avoid thinking about your gender like the plague.   They'll learn that gender is self expression and supposed to make you happy, make you feel like you, not like a prison.
I hate it when I explain that I'm a guy to cis guys and they ask me ""wHaT'S YoUr FaVoRitE CarR?"". It's only happened twice but I've only been out for a few months. Or when a cis guy just.. ""no you're nOt. You have BewBiEs."" Aka.. I feel you, man/my friend. Here's my honest advice that I do my best to stick to, too. They don't understand your problems. It'd be amazing if they did, but they don't. It's not their fault, and it's not yours. The best things that you can do are, a, talk to them. Tell them that this bothers you. B, take a deep breath, and let it go. Talking to them is better but if that doesn't work, just don't let it bring you down. You're awesome, my friend ^^
So I like to say “that’s not a very cis thing to say … interesting” and then start asking questions about how they experience gender.
Being a man/woman is damn hard work, even if you're pretty firmly in one camp. The pressures to perform your gender within very limited parameters are significant for both men and women, and a lot of people who feel/are told they are doing it incorrectly deserve our empathy, even if they don't feel like another gender would suit them any better. I honestly feel it's all part of a spectrum like many things are. Gender is a social construct after all. It's like money, we made it up. I would take it on good faith that they are trying to relate to you, attempting (ok, and maybe failing) to understand you, not trying to invalidate you.
Ugh, call them on it. ""Would you like me to use different pronouns for you?"" ""How do you identify?"" They should scrutinize their gender. A small percentage of them may not be cis, after all.
It's like, I won't say nobody feels entirely man or woman, because that's not true many people feel absolutely ""man"" and/or ""woman"", and to say otherwise would invalidate that. But, I'm sure some cis people don't feel 'entirely' man or woman. I think its healthy for anyone to explore their gender, but that's the thing, cis people don't need to label that feeling. If more people explored their feelings they may realise something about their gender, but for people who are nonbinary, or any other gender descriptor(s) that are/is not exclusively cis woman and cis man, that feeling is why those words exist.
I mean, “well I don’t totally feel like a woman either” is an interesting remark. If men told me the equivalent of themselves, contextually it would be a pretty bold statement that may raise further questioning of the “oh, really?” variety. It may be a bigger jump for a man to admit such, and betray “egg” (yuck) yearnings. Womanhood, as it is, seems to be a lot to live up to and a performance that so many must struggle to buy into, as distinct from being NB.
Hmmm…this is really interesting, it sounds like maybe your mom is doing it specifically in a way to be dismissive of your identity (as in “I don’t always feel like a woman but you don’t see me going around calling myself non-binary”) that would be different then if she is reflecting on genuine feelings. I’ve never experienced this- when i first learned that people “felt” a sense of maleness or femaleness my mind was blown and i went around asking every cis person I could if they “felt” their agab and they all said “yes” without a doubt. They could not always articulate how or why but they all “knew” their agab was correct and “felt” right. Not once did has a cis person told me they don’t always feel their agab- well, that would make them non-binary by definition wouldn’t it? 

Not trying to be dismissive of your experience, this is just really surprising for me to hear.
Water off a ducks back man. I know it’s hard to feel invalidated but cis women will never understand. Sometimes you just gotta be like “Okay.”
Yeah, there's a lot of reasons why cis women in western society may not feel strong or positive emotions about their gender, what with all the deeply ingrained misogyny and socialized fear and whatnot. But they also don't feel an inherent wrongness or incompleteness about being labeled as a woman. Thinking that gender roles are bullshit is of course legit, but it really doesn't speak to the discomfort we experience when we're misgendered.
That whole argument is a red herring for what's really going on. They may say, ""I like blue, I like football, so I'm not totally feminine."" Yeah, those may not fit the female stereotype, but we don't openly shame women for stepping outside those gender boundaries as fiercely as we do men (except for if it has something to do with exercising power. Then the patriarchy HATES it). For me to want to wear a dress as an AMAB, the rules as they are don't let me do that. I need to create a new system that works for me.
I get that too (even more so when I tell people I have depression and they're like ""yeah I'm sad sometimes too!"") but another thing that makes it difficult is, maybe they're an egg and haven't really thought about it before. I know I went through a whole phase of being sad I was ""technically cis"" and ""not really nb enough to call myself that""... so I think the only real way to move the conversation forward in a productive way is to engage them more in thinking about their gender and also let them know how you feel. It's hard, especially if you're not really comfortable going in depth with them.
Ugh I definitely understand this. This is what happened when I tried to tell my grandma about ""a nonbinary friend I have"", basically testing the waters to see how she'd react. She asked for this friend's name, I said Charlie and despite the name being fairly androgynous she went ""Oh so I assume he's a boy nonbinary."" ...Not how it works grandma haha. 

Something similar happened with my mom too, she compared gender dysphoria to the dysmorphia she feels about being fat. Said that maybe it was just something I needed to accept about myself rather than something I needed to change, like what she did with her own body. For this one the only thing I could think of was that I know that surgeries and hormones will make me feel better, so why not do something that will make me feel better? Lots of fat people try to lose weight to feel better, so how is what I want to be doing any different than that? Then she went on to say ""well they're consequences to being trans"" and I'm like fuckin YEAH I know!! I AM trans! Believe me I know the consequences! And if at least a few of the consequences of T and top surgery make me feel better about myself then bring them on man
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA I FELT THAT IT'S SO ANNOYING 
Like no Brenda your urge to cut your hair short or wear a suit is not a gender crisis:D
So true
I would like to offer some perspective but I’m not trying to invalidate your feelings or justify saying shit like that for everybody- it took me a very long time to realize that I was nonbinary and during my freshman year of high school one of my not so close friends came out as trans and I basically said the same thing except I asked them (in a very blunt and insensitive way because I didn’t understand) why they cared about their gender because I didn’t care about mine. What I now understand about my feelings was that I didn’t feel connected to my femininity because I’m not a woman and I didn’t understand how they could actively desire that because I felt so disconnected and also I really didn’t understand what it meant to be trans at the time. So I would just like to say that it’s possible these people who “don’t totally feel like a woman either” actually don’t feel like women and aren’t actually cis but because they don’t experience strong or any dysphoria they don’t even know or understand that they are also nb. That’s definitely not everyone but it definitely was me and it lead to me saying a lot more shitty stuff to trans people because I really was trying to understand and I just needed to get more in touch with myself and honestly I needed to me told I was uneducated and being rude before I figured it out. At the end of the day other people’s motivations don’t change how you feel I’m really sorry you’re being made fo feel invalidated by these people. You are 100% valid in your identity and how you feel about these people saying stuff like that to you. It is very frustrating to hear so I hope maybe being able to see where some of them COULD be coming from could help you shape a conversation with them in a way that’s productive for everyone. Or not if you’re not looking for that
I do this when I'm trying to explain how emotions feel as a person with borderline and people are unintentionally invalidating. ""Ah, so you know what I'm talking about! Great then you'll understand what I mean when I say, take that concept and expand upon it threefold. Take how you described you feel about not entirely feeling as a woman and extrapolate upon it as if it was much more of core sense of yourself and not just a idea feeling that you're able to relate to.""
I feel like gender is such a nuanced thing that if you don’t feel at odds with your assigned gender then you don’t really feel it. Like if you’re cis , I feel like it’s something you have to look into and examine to understand how it feels. 

She won’t feel like a woman probably because she hasn’t reflected much on it. Stick her in a male body and then see how she feels
Yes!!! My grandmother and basically any female i knew growing up would just casually say things like i wish i could pee stand up(when its cold), i wish i had a penis (period pains), it would be cool to write my name in the snow (random thought i guess) these saying made me question myself for years. They held me back from realizing they were just saying and that these women identified with their agab. 

Well i think all of them my grandmother is still in question. She says things that are a bit sus. And some.e part of transness can be genetic i think. Dont remember where i learned that fact. I could be wrong.
I try to explain it to them like gender is a colorwheel, and then leave it be with oppositional people. If on a color wheel man was all shades of blue: from navy to Robin's egg, and woman was all shades of red: from maroon to blush, then I am a completely different color. I personally say that I am yellow in this example, but you might say green or whatever else. I can see the color, the men experiencing manhood and the women experiencing womanhood but I dont live that experience. People like this are fairly one dimensional in the topic of gender and need a second to think on what I've just said, and in that time I change the subject.
When I came out as NB to a friend she did exactly this! I was livid!
[removed]
“Oh, you don’t? Hm. Perhaps we should look into this together…”

That’d be my response lol
I love trying to turn this into a teachable moment about how gender simply isn't binary. About how we are all wonderful, unique people and no two people experience gender the same way, even if they identify with the same binary gender (or even if they both identify as non-binary)

It usually results in a bunch of glazed-over looks from the cis ppl I'm talking to but I'm the type of person who loves explaining things, so either I taught a cis person something or I totally overwhelm them and they don't want to talk about it anymore lol
I understand trying to relate with a personal experience but it feels more like when I tell someone I'm autistic so that's why I may act weird and then they say ""aren't we all a little weird sometimes"" I know it's not their intention but it feels like they are telling me to not make a big deal out of it and be quiet
Hey, I wondered if you might like to share a bit about your journey from mistreating nbinary people and trans men to cracking your egg? I often don’t hear that happening, it seems to happen more the other way around. No worries if not!
Thank you, here is the only place were I can talk about it without feeling rude. If a dude asks for your favourite car just say the Nissan cube and watch their faces 😂
HHaha I love this!!
I definitely have thought about that and I sympathize, but I can't gelp but feel uncomfortable because I have been told that my gender identity and my dysphoria is just a political ideology
This is an interesting point. I believe we made gender roles and expression up - is that what you mean? But I think gender is inherent regardless of society. I feel my gender is an innate part of who I am and it’s society that convinced me otherwise and it’s taken a lot of unlearning to reach this point. Like I feel quite strongly that if I was away from society my whole life, and had never seen a man before, I would feel uncomfortable with my body even if I didn’t know what I wanted. Maybe that’s something different though. What do you think? ( I’m transmasc btw)
I KNOW! I literally commented that I would say “Oh you do? Then maybe we should look into this together” because if you don’t fully feel like you’re a woman maybe it’s time to question your gender
I would say most cis people don’t feel entirely their gender. I think they just carry out the gender roles expected of them by society and carry on because nothing necessarily feels ‘off’ or another gender role doesn’t feel ‘better’ like it does for us trans folk. I think they just don’t scrutinise what they’re experiencing and so they’re disconnected from their identity and don’t really feel it
I mean, yeah. Who’s to say they’re as cis as they look? I assume most people here were in the closet at some point, so it really confuses me that people are so hostile towards what seems to be a good faith attempt to relate.

Like, we’re nonbinary to be honest to ourselves, not to feel special.
“I don’t always feel like a woman but you don’t see me going around calling myself non-binary” 
this is exactly what I hear. And it is qhite possible that my mom is actually nb since she has said in the past that she feel like a boy and a girl. If that's the case good for her and I will suport her, in that case it would be like ""I've been stuck being a woman all my life so you don't get to be your gender either""
>But they also don't feel an inherent wrongness or incompleteness about being labeled as a woman.

Not everyone who’s not a woman experiences that, and it’s certainly not required to be nonbinary. I’m fine with being labeled a man, I’m fine with being labeled a woman, I’m fine with being labeled whatever - none of these words mean anything to me anyways.
I totally went through that ""I'm not totally a boy, so I'm not trans"" phase. It's not my job to crack someone's shell either
They think we haven't thought of the consequences of coming out and transitioning😂
Also, I have had body dysmorphia and dysphoria and they are different feelings, sometimes they can overlap but the dysmorphia can get cured with learning self esteem and healing traumas. But dysphoria doesn't go away, it just gets worse for me. 
I just wish I could tell this to my mom but J know anything I say will be used against me.
I really appreciate your comment. 
I think that most women in today's society don't feel connected to womanhood because it has a lot of negative baggage and expectations, and outside of the trad definition of what a woman is, there is not an answer to ""what is a woman"".
Some cis women relate to the positive experiences asociated with being a woman and afab but don't feel conected to that mytical unatainable image of what a woman is suposed to be. 
This is all my opinion, I may be wrong.
How did you respond?
This user is a transphobic troll. Reported and blocking.
Yeah, that's when you realize who is actually interested in deconstructing/abolishing gender and who just wants to invalidate my experience
That analogy makes a lot of sense—it does feel very minimizing for people to say stuff like that.
Oh god i know what you mean. I told my MIL i’m getting diagnosed with autism (little by little, broke as shit) and she told me “when they made it a spectrum, it includes everyone!” like literally no but alright
I was ABOUT TO BRING UP AUTISM BUT DAMN! I feel this in my goddamn soul. ""Everyone's a little Autistic"" NO THE FUCK THEY AREN'T, SHARON!! *autisticscreeching.mp4*


~*Takes a breath*~ Sorry, I get a little passionate sometimes.


When someone says that to me, if I have the time and crayons, I try to explain to them how this sentiment is actually super harmful and invalidating. It shouldn't be our job to educate people about Autism, but honestly, who better to do it? This method isn't for everyone, and that's ok. It's what I like to do.
So I've never had these feelings about trans women, oddly enough.  Just nbs and trans men, trans women have always been ""valid"" to me, for lack of better wording. 
NBs we're dumb to me because hurr durr biology, and you can't possibly be something other than a man or a woman because that doesn't exist.  I had a very eurocentric idea of gender and gender expression and refused to educate myself. 
Trans men openly pissed me off because it felt like an escape?  Like no, noone likes being a woman, if everyone was honest wed all be trans

And then I learned from cis people that no, those feelings are not universal, it's not normal to hate being a woman, it's not normal to be grosaed out by your anatomy.  Almost all of it was routed in jealousy that they were able to be themselves, and I had too many hangups to do the things myself.
xD I usually avoid answering :P
>Maybe that’s something different though.

Yeah, that’s different. Being uncomfortable with your body because it’s male/female isn’t exactly the same as being uncomfortable with a *gender* - lots of trans people don’t experience dysphoria and are fine with never transitioning. Honestly it should be called *sex* dysphoria and not *gender* dysphoria, because bodies aren’t gendered in and of themselves.

*Sex* is somewhat inherent, and some people might have an inherent *preferred sex* which causes dysphoria, but that’s a different thing from gender, which is the social component that we made up.
Yeah it's  some human bullshit! I don't know what that dismorphia feels like. Unless we actually transition most people will only ever experience the one gender in their lifetimes so it's really hard to make a comparison! I don't feel like a quote unquote ""woman"", I don't think I'm good at the things that women are told to be good at, I don't feel comfortable with that label. But I'm also clearly not a dude. I don't think I'd be any better at performing a masculine gender. I would like to put my pronouns on things because it's kind and inclusive, but I'm not comfortable with any of them. I respect the trans experience and I want to understand it, but like, I just think gender as an idea is kind of flimsy!
I’m inclined to agree. So long as they’re not doing the “oh, I don’t feel much like my AGAB sometimes” riposte to minimise the NB experience. And even then, perhaps something can be done to relax their resistance; after all, these are unfamiliar concepts to most people. It’s indeterminate whether they’re erasing you, intend to, or aren’t currently persuadable.

There’s probably more to work on than much of what I hear from others (eg. “These days there are about 50 sexes!” from someone in my running club last night, blurted out of nowhere).
yeah, i really don't get where all the hostility is from. get mad at people who make fun of us, discriminate etc., but it's fucking hard being a woman and if they're trying to relate, it's ok imho. i'd even say all afab people will at some point in their lives have been wondering if they're doing the whole female thing right. if you perform femininity, you're shamed for being vain and emptyheaded, if you don't, the world will call you a pick me girl or a not like other girls girl. can't do it right. 

so i fail why we need to get so mad at cis women expressing they've struggled with that, it's obviously not the same as being non binary or having dysphoria, but it's still a valid feeling.
What do you think your mom would say if you said,  not in a mocking tone but compassionately, “mom, I don’t think that is the way most cis people feel, is it possible you’re nonbinary?” You could even follow it with an explanation of what Demi is or something since it sounds like she is connected to feeling female at least some of the time. 

In regards to the second argument you could say something like “most of your life the concept of a binary gender was so predominant that a lot of people didn’t have a concept of, let alone a language for, anything other than male or female. Things have changed and I’m lucky to have a language and community that supports me. I get how this might be confusing or scary to think about, but it’s no longer taboo and I don’t have to deny part of my existence or experience, it would mean a lot to me if you could try give me the support that nobody gave you.” 

Another thing that came to mind while writing this was why? Why does it make her uncomfortable? What does she fear? I know this is an insanely difficult thing to do and would take a crap ton of courage and self control (although if you’ve already been open with her about your gender you are not lacking in courage) but perhaps you could ask her to explain/share why it makes her uncomfortable. She might not know, but asking might open some doors to self reflection and progress. 

My last bit of advice is to you is to try to remember that your mom is just a human, with her own experiences who makes mistakes. Her discomfort probably comes from fear for you having a harder life as well the destruction of the future she envisioned for you. It takes a lot of practice, but you’ll both fare better if you can try  reframe from feeling invalidated and attacked and instead feel sorry for your mom who’s narrow minded thinking is likely from most of her life receiving significantly more frequent and hateful trans and homophobic messaging than you have. I’m not saying it’s ok, but it’s also not her fault, it’s more like bad programming, so you’re left trying to fix the code but it’s so dated it’s in some obscure language you never learned. Of course you’re going to get frustrated trying to figure it out, and it’s prob going to take a few tries, some guesswork and a shit ton of patience but if she’s a good person eventually you two will get there.
I kinda think that falls under feeling like being labeled a binary gender is incomplete. I don't think being called a woman is outright incorrect for me, but it definitely doesn't encompass who I am or how I feel. It's part of me, not the whole of me.
I tried to argue that it was not the same but she didn’t understand. I eventually gave up and changed the topic.
Can you tell me more about being a ""gender abolitionist""? That sounds like a label I can get around
Thanks so much for your thoughtful response. I think I was unclear as I conflated my gender with my sex so my bad. But I agree that they are two different things. I wonder where that means I fit in the community as my sex is my biggest issue and I get the sense that most people feel the way you described -i.e non sex dysphoric 

I feel that my gender, not sex, is core. I feel it is something that I was born with that was then heavily bullied out of me until this point in my life. I feel that innate feeling would exist outside of society as well, but I recognise not everyone feels that way. I think we have an innate gender identity that then either aligns or misaligns with the gender society puts on us and it’s the innate gender that tells us who we are and what we like
I really appreciate that.
For sure!

The general idea is that since gender isn’t actually real and is backed by nothing but our own prejudiced ideals of what it *should* be, we simply should stop acknowledging that it exists, with the long-term goal of erasing its influence on society. No one is *really* a man or a woman after all - there’s no essence of “man-ness” or “woman-ness” or “something-else-ness” deep down that makes us so - these are just stories we’ve managed to convince ourselves to believe. We can stop believing them.

Of course, this doesn’t mean that we should stop acknowledging or trying to fight things like sexism and transphobia - just because someone doesn’t believe in God, for example doesn’t mean they’d necessarily be blind on the impact of the *belief* in God on society - just that we need to look at them from a different angle. 

Instead of “women (as some sort of monolithic, a priori group) are oppressed by society and aren’t given the same rights/opportunities”, we’d say “people who are *labelled as ‘women’ by society* are oppressed because of this label”; similarly, instead of saying “trans people are oppressed by society for daring to live as the gender they really are”, we’d say “people who fair to conform to the expectations of the gender society assigns to them are oppressed as a result”, sidestepping the essentialism that’s sadly all too common in trans discourse."	rw347c	NonBinary	353	0.97	2022-01-04 19:55:10
have had a hard time wearing makeup lately bc dysphoria but these pictures feel very Gender™️ to me for some reason		"Very gender, love the look
The armpit hair plus makeup is indeed very gender, I dig. I feel like you have the facial features to have a full face of makeup and still look androgynous if you want. I'm jelly.
Very sexy. I like it
This is a cute makeup look!!!

I think I might be trans non binary but my girlfriend is a radfem: what can I do? ( trigger warning ⚠️ )	"Hello! I'm the same person who wrote about dysphoria and wanting to go back transitioning. 

My dysphoria came back after 2 years of being ""gone"" (and by """" I mean that I'm thinking some aspects of my condition didn't went away all this time). I have dysphoria since I was 14yo and received and formal diagnosis at 17. I wanted to transition really bad by undergoing top surgery and microdosing T.

I talked about my friends about this: dysphoria, being confused and thinking that I tried to suppress my symptoms and desire for transitioning. They were very welcoming and I felt safe! 

Well, not the same happened to my girlfriend. I'll be honest: she is a radfem and I used to think somethings like her in the past (maybe due to projection or something), but not anymore. I didn't say anything about transitioning itself, I tried at first talking about my dysphoria and she said it could be ""me wanting to fit beauty standards"" (even tho I do already do fit, I'm white and have a thin body, except for being masc), ""internalized misogyny"" (even tho I dont feel offended being called a woman and etc), that maybe ""dont think I can be a woman just for being masc"" and other things like that. I said to her that me knowing those things won't make my dysphoria go away and that is something much more deeper.

One day I posted on my twitter a drawing I made of myself happy with a flat chest from top surgery. She and a friend of hers got upset. My girlfriend tried to argue the same thing. She even said she thought she was trans to, but she realized it came from s.a.. I thought that speech was really heavy and dishonest. Isn't that similar to saying gay people are gay just because ""they were s.a.""?

And that's not all: she usually makes fun of trans people, specially non binary. From my perspective, I think she tries to justify the transgender experience with just her personal perceptions, based on her own ideology, also with ""scientific facts"" that are not even a consensus in the scientific community, which I warned her about, such as ""autogynephilia"" and etc. She makes attempts to put all trans people in the same box: trans men are just ""poor women with internalized misoginy"", trans women ""gay men who can't accept themselves"" and that enbies are ""not really trans"". I find it funny that she usually misgender trans people she thinks are ""not really trans"", but if she's talking about a trans person who are ""not queer""/conservative, she uses their preferred pronouns. I pointed this behavior of hers, but she got kinda silent lol. I find it very simplistic to condition a group of people to the same negative thing, given that they are diverse and have VERY complex experiences.

It's easy to mock a group of people when you don't pass what they go though. And I get mad because that's also mocking my past experience. Yes, I did the same in the past, probably to feel better about myself and hide my desire for transition, but I don't want to be that kind of person anymore. Is not good, for me and for others, to talk negative things about a group ALL THE TIME. I feel bad and embarrassed by that.

I don't know what to do. I'm really upset and I don't feel safe with her to talk about this. (I edited the post to put more information and correct some gramatical mistakes)."	"she sounds like an awful person and not an ally to you or the trans community. maybe I'm just tired from all the anti-trans legislation going on in my country but I would run away fast if I were you. a loved one is supposed to support you, not perpetuate hate towards you. don't let a transphobe tell you who you are.
>I don’t feel safe with her to talk about this.

All you need to focus on is leaving her. She will not change, she will not see it from your perspective, she will continue to spout untrue and harmful bullshit to refute your identity. You may have feelings about her but she does not care about you as a whole person. This is not someone you can trust or feel safe around, there’s no point in staying with them or trying to change her mind. Start getting your affairs in order if you live with her because things will not improve and you deserve to pursue transition if it will make you happy.
Even if you weren’t non-binary I would suggest breaking up with her because she is an asshole
I don't see how this can work out in any healthy way if she's relying on pseudoscientific arguments to defend deliberate cissexism, and you can't feel safe - much less seen or accepted - in your relationship. I'm sorry. Best wishes.
That is such an awful place to be; having to chose between your relationship and your gender identity. I'm sure she has a lot of wonderful attributes which weren't included in the post, which is why you got with her in the first place. But it does sound like you'll never be able to explore your gender identity, and those dysphoric feelings probably won't just go away on their own.  We all end up suppressing parts of ourselves in relationships (i.e. I love musicals and my partner hates them so I don't watch them around him), but gender identity is a really big part. If it's too big of a part, you'll likely end up resenting her or feeling unfulfilled in your self. I could tell you what I think you should do, based on my perceptive, but I don't know how it feels to be you. You're the only one who can determine if the dysphoria/desire to transition is something you can bottle up, and if she's worth it.  Best of luck my friend, whichever way you decide.
have some respect for yourself and break up with her!! life is too short to deal with radfems
Please leave her
You literally don't like your girlfriend. You admitted it. Breakup.
Leave her? Im sorry sounds like a no brainer to me. 

People that don't accept you for you are not worth keeping around.

You'll eventually find someone else more compatible, you'll hurt for a while but you'll be glad you did yourself a favour by choosing your life over a temporary person.

I don't want to sound like I'm dismissing your relationships but relationships aren't everything. If being with a person makes you miserable then you shouldn't be with them.
You are not safe with her to talk about this, because she is clearly not safe. She needs to be let go. She is not supporting you by mocking and downplaying your lived experience and knowledge of yourself.

It genuinely makes me suspicious that maybe she really has felt a lot of the same but has ""successfully"" packed it away with internalized transphobia of her own... 🤷 Many many people who can't accept that they might be trans (or gay, or nonbinary) will find defense mechanisms that include shooting down that minority as a way of distancing themself from it...

Even so. She sounds extremely toxic on this front, and that's not someone you should be with even if you weren't personally the affected minority.
Please realize that even if you do realize you are cis, you are dating a transphobe. Can you really live with the fact that you love and are romantically involved with a transphobic person at a time where trans violence is at an all time high and the lives of young trans children are at stake?
Break up with her
I'm sorry but your gf and her friend sound like terrible people. TERFS are bad people, full stop.

I would remove them from my life
just as she has the right to end your relationship if you transition, you have the right to protect yourself, your well-being, and your dignity by not allowing your fear of someone's reaction keep you from transitioning. you are worth far more than the respect you are receiving, and i strongly recommend you reevaluate what positive things this relationship is bringing to you when such an important part of your life is being dismissed, downplayed, and disrespected. transitioning can make us lose people in the process, but it also guides us to the people who love us most no matter what path we undergo. you deserve better than this relationship.
She sounds like, at best, a person with an awful lot of trauma to unpack from several sides and an identity to unpack as well, and at worst, a great big transphobe. Either way, you deserve better. Your partner should make you feel safe and accept you always. One day, she may learn and grow, but you do not have to be the testing ground for her to do so. You deserve better.
I also give this advice to all the bisexual people who are in straight relationships and feel like they can’t talk to their partner about it… DO NOT TOLERATE ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT DOESN’T RESPECT THE WHOLE YOU.
Your girlfriend is not a ""radical feminist"", she's not out burning bras, she's a **TE**RF, she's a shitty fucking transphobe.  The hell with her and her asshole friends.  Get yourself out of this relationship, she is not a good or healthy person for you to be with.
Only read the title. Your only option is to be direct, honest, and authentic. If she can't accept you, or isn't willing to try in some capacity, you have to decide whether or not she is worth the stress in your life moving forward. She is either with you or behind you. Your health and all comes first.
it sounds scary but you need to leave. I had a doctor who refused to give me HRT due to my past with SA and as soon as she said those words out loud I immediately decided to never go back again. ive been on T for nearly two years now.
if you do not feel safe with her now, you will not feel safe with her. this is not the person you want to spend your energy on. she will not help you grow.
**break up with her.** she is not a safe person to be around, and she’s not a good person in general. radfems are a hate group and you’d be best off getting far away from her.
I understand you're going through a lot and that you must care about your girlfriend. I have to be honest though, as someone who has been repeatedly told awful things by self proclaimed radfems, I cannot support them at all. Again, I understand she must have good qualities and that you care about her. I also hope that you find it in yourself one day to accept yourself and cut anybody who describes themselves as a radfem out of your life, because as long as she identities as one she will never accept you. She will try to tell you awful things about being trans and why you feel the way you do. You don't need that, especially when you're so early on in questioning. 

It is okay that you have this past because you are learning now. It's always okay to change our hearts and minds and be kinder. As long as she still identifies as a radfem, she is surrounding herself by some of the most hateful people. It doesn't take much googling to find cases of radfems and TERFS doing everything up to and including murdering trans women. 

Radfems and TERFS are genuinely dangerous people. I don't say that lightly. Again, I hope you find it in yourself to accept who you are and continue to learn and find people who aren't so hateful to be in your life.
She does not sound like she is very loving towards you.
If you don't want to be that kind of person anymore, why date that person? She's not going to change any time soon and it's not your job to make her a better person
get a new girlfriend
Sounds like a piece of shit

Find someone better
Just ask yourself if you want to be with someone you don’t feel safe to be yourself around. or do you deserve to be with someone who loves you for who you are and fully supports you in your journey of exploring your gender and identity. the answers to these questions will make it clear as to what you should do for yourself. 
whenever you’re ready, i’m sure you will find a way to be true to yourself and choose what you deserve.
Leave that rude ass transphobe
Dump her. She sounds absolutely horrible, and no person is worth staying with if they disrespect you for being who you want to be.
I would urge you to leave this relationship, if you can.  I was in a similarly terrible relationship before I started transitioning, and it held me back for years and caused so much misery that made it even harder to accept myself later.  These people almost never change, and even if her views somehow changed, it sounds like she's being emotionally abusive in ways that often are even more ingrained than bad viewpoints.
I highly recommend reading some essays by Dr. Devon Price, like *Irreversible Healing: What Testosterone has Done for Me* [here](https://devonprice.medium.com/irreversible-healing-what-testosterone-has-done-for-me-6e4b2f086823) or *My Dalliance with Detransition* [here](https://devonprice.medium.com/my-dalliance-with-detransition-97ac9a5126e6). He is pretty honest about his transition and difficulties before, during, after. He is also very adamant about not lying to ourselves, and figuring out ways to be more comfortable and satisfied as a result.
Y'know, from experience with that sad excuse for a community, a lot of ""radfems"" are actually trans, they're just too broke, too cowardly, and too oblivious to know it. 

Many of them have severe androphobia due to trauma and it leaks out into every aspect of their lives. 

For your own mental health, get out of that relationship. It's not worth the amount of work.
I also fell somewhat down the radfem pipeline before I accepted that I’m nonbinary- biological essentialism and black and white thinking feels simple and somewhat comforting but in truth the world is far far more complex than radfem ideology allows for. 

You should leave your girlfriend- she is actively hindering your journey of learning who you are. No one needs to know why you’ve broken up with her, people end relationships for all sorts of things. Most people will accept that you just didn’t feel romantically for her any more. 

The most important thing is that you are able to self reflect and develop without feeling scrutinised by someone who will judge your identity.
Even if you're not trans she's still a piece of shit and your relationship is conditional
Breakup with her, she’s clearly not a safe person for you and she may even cause you to slip back into your old ways, and the whole “being trans bc of SA” Is disgusting and is extremely transphobic. You should be allowed to transition and be whoever you want to be and she’s holding you back from that when she’s meant to support you. You should get away from you before she goes full TERF
Everyone saying you have to leave her clearly hasn’t been in any situation like this. Firstly, I’m so sorry you’re going through this. It’s so tough. I really, really hope things work out. 

Maybe seek out advice from friends- specifically mutual friends. You want advice and help without painting her as the villain and being told by everyone in your circle to split. These friends could have separate conversations with her (not about you, just the subject)

You could do some things to ‘ease’ her into it. Go to different community events, pride things, etc. Repost resources and things on your social media stories; things about accepting ALL LGBT+ people, things about trans rights, etc. 

At the end of the day though, it’s your decision. You get to choose how much time and energy you want to put into educating her. No matter what you do choose, I really do wish you the best of luck and peace of mind
Break up with her. Honestly. She will never accept you as you are, she won't even entertain the idea and would rather talk you out of it :/
You're feelings make a lot of sense. That feels like a direct conflict between your romantic relationship and your personal identity. Both integral things you don't want to have pitted against each other!

You could tell her all of this. If you think there's any hope of carrying on with the relationship, she would need to hear and understand all of that. I don't know her, so I don't know if that's likely.
this is going to sound harsh, but I wouldn’t recommend staying in a relationship with her. Even if you can get her to change her mind (which sounds extremely difficult at this point in time) it’ll take a lot of time and emotional energy. as someone who had a radfem best friend while i was 17 and finally accepting that i was trans (though i first verbally expressed maybe not being cis when i was 14), it’ll take a while to undo the damage that people like that have on you. and it truly held me back. I probably would’ve started t a lot sooner, considered top surgery a lot sooner, and changed my name a lot sooner if she hadn’t been against all those things for me. if someone’s actively mocking the trans community, they probably are gonna bring you a lot of strife to keep in your circle
The fact that your friends are supportive of you is a sign that there are people out there that will accept you for who you are. You deserve better than whatever the hell she's been giving you, and I would imagine you'd be better off without her transphobic views in your life. I don't see her changing anytime soon :(
(i didn't find out which pronouns you prefer so i am going with they / them, i hope that's okay)
when i read your post, i thought: good, this person understands exactly what is going on with their girlfriend. i think you already know what to do. you gave me a pretty good picture of your situation. she is not respecting or recognising how you feel, because of her own way of seeing things.
maybe really consider taking a break from each other. i bet that's what's on your mind too.
you can try that and see if you feel better when she is not around. maybe you find to your true self faster without her.
(Apologies for long comment)
as a nonbinary dyke who considers themselves somewhat radfem (trans affirming+believes that Women's Lib and Trans Lib go hand in hand) I think you might want to sit with the hard truth that your gf is unlikely to come around to your way of thinking anytime soon. From what you described, she is heavily peaked/indoctrinated into gender critical ideology, and it's likely she is surrounded by an online community that will provide her with built in ""explanations"" as to why you want to seek transition. If you stay together and go on T/get top surgery, best case scenario, she goes along with it while secretly pitying you/not taking it seriously. Worst case, she'll actively try to undermine your medical choices with the encouragement of her GC friends. In either scenario, your relationship will become incompatible with your happiness, If it already isnt. 

That being said, I have talked to quite a few ex TERFs/GCs who've managed to break out of the ideology, (it sounds like you were one of them) so it's not impossible for her to change. If you want to go that route, the best way to approach it is to introduce pro trans talking points through a radfem framework.  @aletheia327 on Twitter is an ex TERF but still radfem who writes often about why she was attracted to GC ideology until she realized it was reactionary, transphobic, and anti feminist. it might be easier for her to digest if she hears critique of her view from someone who doesn't inherently see trans rights through the lense of a queer people vs feminism culture war. I would also look into the work of Leslie Feinberg, a historical lesbian and transgender activist who considered zirself both transgender and a lesbian (by modern queer terminology would prob be described as a transmasc butch), which might help her understand the complexities and nuances of the trans experience.

Realistically, I don't know how much success that will reap, since it sounds like you've been trying and extending her a lot of patience to no avail. And I know it's devastating to realize you love someone who is slowly killing you inside. But ultimately, you know you've felt this way since you were 14. you know that no amount of ""unpacking internalized misogyny"" will make this go away, because you've already tried. And you deserve to surround yourself with people who make you feel safe and don't project their own gender related trauma onto you and dismiss you. And if she can't be that person for you, it might be time to let her go. 
Sending you all my love. I'm so sorry you're going through this, and I hope you come to the conclusion that's best for you and your health, not your girlfriend's comfort.
Radfeminism breeds terfs. She is not in your corner.
I understand being in a difficult relationship and being afraid to leave or feeling as though maybe things will work out or that you can get her to change but please, it’s not worth it. I ended a relationship with a bigoted partner two years ago after I couldn’t take pretending to be cis any longer. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done but things are so much better now that I have the room to grow and be myself. You deserve that!! Your current relationship is not worth the pain of suppressing who you are and it will destroy you to keep going the way things are
Make sure you have a support group like a friend or family that knows you're breaking things off and safely break up with her. Radfem's believe in very dangerous stuff, and i'd suggest going with your own judgement regarding how you break things off. Please stay safe
She sounds awful.
I would leave someone like that
Who you are has NOTHING to do with who you’re dating. Don’t compromise your identity for her. I did and regret it.
she doesn't sound like a healthy person to have a relationship with. you (and everyone!!) deserve to have relationships with people who respect you and make you feel safe. not the same but i have been in a situation where i felt like i couldn't tell my partner things because i was worried about the way they would react and it's not a good way to live. if you'd like some support feel free to message me if you think it would help you 💓
One is supposed to feel safe around a partner. If you don't it's not a person who deserves you
Personally I would break up with someone like this, whether or not I was ultimately trans. I don't date openly racist people either, even though they wouldn't be racist against *me* because I'm white. Staying with someone like this is a tacit endorsement of their beliefs imo. Dating her is a problem regardless of whether you ultimately decide you're trans, and excising this particular tumor should be done sooner rather than later. For both of your sakes, and especially because she's creating a really unhealthy environment to try to explore your gender identity in.
Break up with her. Seriously. If this is how she is now, it's likely not going to get better in the future. You deserve to be with someone you can be yourself with.
This entire post feels like a giant red flag. She's constantly dismissing your ideas immediately, mocking a group of people she knows nothing about, and I think the worst part is the quote ""I don't feel safe with her to talk about this."" A romantic partner should be someone who you feel comfortable sharing your struggles and questions with without any fear, who you feel safe to talk to. I'm not just going to say ""Leave her she's terrible"" or anything because I don't know what she's like outside of this issue, but this does feel like you either need to have a discussion about it, or break up with her.
Someone you're dating should be someone who supports you, someone who you feel safe around, someone who accepts all of you not just the parts they like, someone who you can trust. Please ask yourself if all, or any, of these apply to your girlfriend. And if they don't, ask yourself why she's your girlfriend.
I give you permission to break up with her 🖤🖤🖤
Honestly, if you can work up the courage to, then I'd tell her. Depending on her reaction (as in if it's seemingly neutral or better), then I'd probably give her some time to see if her general behaviour towards trans and nonbinary people changes. If it doesn't, then she fundamentally would not respect you as a person, only her idea of you, and that's not the foundations of a lasting positive relationship.
Tbh even if you were cisgender I’d tell you to break up with her.

She’s a toxic asshole with shitty views and you can do so much better. She won’t let you be who you want to be, and it’s not your job to “fix” her. Call it there, and end it. Don’t even be friends, she doesn’t deserve it, and you don’t deserve to have to put up with someone like her.
Run. Get as far away as you can. That is fucking terrifying. You deserve better, and I don't mean to sound dramatic or scare you, but people like her can be dangerous. ***Please*** be careful. The fact that you don't feel safe talking with her about this shows just how precarious your situation is. Listen to your instincts. Surround yourself with people who love and care about you and will protect you. I personally would view this as a domestic abuse-type situation, and the period of getting away from the abuser is always the most dangerous time.
If she can not grow to accept you, you've given her time to come around, and she hasn't and decided to invalidate yours and others' feelings -

Then leave. As a partner, even if she doesn't understand where you are coming from the least she could do is try but instead she has attacked you for an identity/label that made you feel safe and demonized your feelings and disrespected you and your community completely. I know it's disappointing, but it's the option that would likely make you happiest, even if you lose someone you love in the long run. It's definitely better than her suddenly leaving you because of your identity, though.
only read the title, but fucker her.
uh

yikes at her being transphobic

Why are you going out with a transphobe who makes you feel unsafe?
Hey, this take might be a little spicy, but I’m just going to be honest. depending on the flavor of radfem, in my experience they don’t usually make safe dating partners, at least not for people who aren’t cis women. I’m an amab nb with varied gender presentation and my ex was a radfem leaning woman who shamed me for my body and was pretty open about hating men and amab people in general. I understand she had a lot of trauma from men which led her to that point, but I honestly walked away from the relationship carrying my own trauma and shame because of the way she made me feel about my body and gender. She wasn’t explicitly transphobic like many other radfems but her ideas did lead her down the rabbit hole of browsing terf and misandrist subreddits and stuff like that, which was honestly really upsetting to me, but I find it can be incredibly hard to reason with people of that perspective. After I broke up with her I basically vowed to never put myself through anything like that again. I have compassion for radfems and recognize there are deep societal inequalities that lead them to their ideas. I hope they can change, but for me they have just been generally unsafe to be around and I can’t imagine this experience being all that much better as a trans man or masc presenting non-binary person. Please be careful and remember that people like this can have a huge impact on others’ mental health
Hey! I’m a radfem, but not all radfems are trans-exclusionary; your girlfriend is just a dick. if you can’t be yourself around her then there’s no point continuing in a relationship. it’s hard but you shouldn’t give up your own freedom for assimilating into a relationship that will hurt you.
I have no idea what your gender is; no one else can tell you that. But you should have a support network that wants you to be happy and that will support you no matter your gender. If someone thinks there is an automatic right or wrong outcome for you as you explore your gender, they aren't really supportive of you.
I'm so sorry your girlfriend has shown she's not a safe person to be open with
You can't change her mind for her, all you can do is decide whether or not you want to stay
Honestly, even putting aside your own identity here - there's an obvious conflict between your beliefs and hers. She's transphobic, you disagree, and arguing about it isn't working. She's making fun of you to her friends/publicly putting you down about a sensitive and personal struggle.

I don't see her as particularly different from (another common example unfortunately) a cishet guy with a bisexual girlfriend, who he doesn't see as ""really queer"" and makes homophobic remarks in front of / about, while dismissing her identity as ""just from SA"" or wanting to be ""not like the other girls"". Both would be shitty, bigoted behaviours, even if they \*weren't\* talking to someone who is a part of the group being derided. To do all that to someone you're supposed to love and support is just... cruel.

That you were out, changed your mind (and engaged in terf-y spaces), and are now in a state of questioning and wanting to come out again is understandable. It's rarely a straight line from realisation to actualisation. Going back in the closet because you thought you were wrong, or that something else would be easier, or because the world is scary and you *hoped* you were wrong... happens. Can't beat yourself up about that. Also not worth beating yourself up if you do land on being cis again. The question is what do you want to do now, and do you want to tolerate someone who is going to dictate how much of yourself you're 'allowed' to be.
break up with her. you'll not have support and your dysphoria, at some point, will become a joke to her.

u dont deserve someone who don't understand u on your changings. its sad, but she changes only if she wants and maybe she won't do it. and probably will make fun of you on your process. is not easy, but think in a long term.
My guy, you should just break up with her
break up with her cuz she’s an asshole.
I’m sorry but your girlfriend sounds like an absolute trash human. I mean no one is perfect but she seems to be deliberately interested in causing harm. 

I wish you all the best as you navigate all of this. I really reallllllly recommend considering leaving this person so you have the space you deserve and need in order to explore and experience your gender. I hope you have supportive people (or at least one person) you can turn to.
Dude you need to leave her regardless, she is a horrid person
This, for real. Anyone who tries to make you fit the mold of what they think you should be is not worth keeping in your life.
She is wonderful in many things! But I really am afraid: I'm not sure yet what I am going to do, if I'm cis or trans, who am I... but I can't erase my transgender experience. It was a big part of me, I can't erase me. I tried, but that's is disrespecting my own being. If just being ""political"" (like what many radfems like to say) and acknowledging misogyny would be enough, my body dysphoria wouldn't have been back and I wouldn't have been questioning myself and my beliefs. How I perceive myself was always different, since I was 14. It didn't changed, even if I tried to hide it. I'm afraid if I discover myself as trans non binary and be sure 100% I want to continue my transition, will she make fun of me? Will she say bad things just like she says about other trans people? Will she sees myself in a different way?

If I break up with her, my mother will sure want to know why I did it. I really CANNOT tell her about this. she will definitely be sad if I say Im thinking about going back to transition. I don't want to be judged. I really wouldn't know what to say if she asked ""why did you breakup with your girlfriend? Everything was going okay, wasn't it?"".
This is a nice take. Only OP can know what is most important here.
Worth noting, though, that even if you bottle it up, if it really is important it will come back out later!
Yes! I really think people who talk bad things about a group of people so much are probably a part of it, but they are denying themselves. For exemple, as a lesbian, I always have said ""lesbians"" who treat bisexual women badly and call them names 24/7 are probably bi and have internalized biphobia. I saw many ""lesbians"" like these that ended up coming out as bi with a boyfriend, what they ""feared the most"".

I wonder if that was also my case, but about transitioning
I guess flirted with some aspects of radfem thinking because of my projection and anger I felt at the time I came out as ""cis"" and also trying to distanciaste myself from the trans community due to that. Also maybe to get validation from my mom and the rest of the society. I remember my mom saying very clearly that she's ""glad that her daughter is a lesbian and not some trans man"". That was like a fuel to me for suppress my desire for transition and just act ""normal like every other women""

I'm glad I'm not alone. Now I see how lots of people of this ideology can be hurtful. My girlfriend really likes to say unpleasant things about transness. It doesn't feel good being surrounded by people who spend all of their time being a bigot, calling trans people this and enbies that. Even me, who aren't even sure about being non binary, is getting tired of that negativity.
No problem! I actually feel okay with any pronouns (and my name is Noah too!!)

Yes, I'm thinking about the possibility of breaking up, not gonna lie, but I always think a lot before making a decision. I'll probably make an appointment with my therapist only to talk about this situation. She's a good person in many things, but when it comes about dysphoria and all... I think there is really a possibility of me going back to transition because the idea of having a flat chest makes me euphoric and I don't think suppressing that feeling will make me feel better and stop my dysphoria. I don't want to be with someone that I'm afraid of being judged for exploring myself. 

But, at the same time, I'm afraid of what she and her friends are going to think of me? I don't know if she is going to see me in a different way and treat me like a joke just like she does with other trans people. Yes, I also was like this, but I don't want to anymore, I won't project myself in this community and talk negative things about them. That's not cool at all. And I don't want to be criticized for changing.
Thank you for your kind words! I'm going to look forward reading Leslie's work, because I'm both lesbian (I still identify as one after all, I don't see myself as a straight trans man) and gender non conforming. 

I'm really afraid of talking about this situation with my girlfriend. I'm almost sure she will ask me (again) not to go to a trans specialist because they will ""force transition down my throat"" or will say (again) that I'm like this ""maybe because I don't think I can be a woman because I'm butch"". I'm afraid that if I break up with her, but stay as friends, she will view me as ""one more butch woman who felt down the 'liberal trans ideology'"", maybe say that I'm ""not really trans"" because I choose the label non binary to describe my experience. I don't want pity from anyone nor feel judged. I just want to live my life like everyone else, in a body that I feel most represented, like how I see myself in my own mind.

Even before questioning gender critical thinking, I tried explaining to her why people with dysphoria choose to transition and I think is a valid way (precisely because I LITERALLY went through that) but she really did disagree and all. I always tried to give her a perspective of a dysphoric person, but she still have the same exact beliefs. 

I guess I still have to unpack more of my past trauma (fear of not being accepted, being excluded and judged) because I'm THAT afraid of what a person who I'm dating for only 4 MONTHS and her friends, who I never saw in my entire life, are going to think of me.
Well, she's not making fun of me, particularly. But if I say ""hey I'm feeling dysphoric, I'm thinking about buying binder tapes and maybe going to a trans specialist who can help me"" or ""I'm thinking about top surgery, I think I'll feel happy"" she will probably say again ""but that's wrong, that's mutilating your body"" ""oh it's all internalized misogyny"" ""don't go to a trans clinic, they will push transition down your throat"" ""maybe you think you can't be a woman because you're butch"" and more things like that. These words are not welcoming at all, and knowing it won't make my dysphoria disappear. Making me feel bad about it and suppressing these emotions won't help, definitely. She NEVER had experience with being trans as I did and she will NEVER know how it feels like.
That's what I'm afraid. What would stop her from saying ""oh [my name] went back being those queers"" or ""she thinks she's that non binary nonsense"" ""oh poor one, she was brainwashed by those liberal trans queers"" about me, just like she says about other people. I'll admit I was just like this, but I don't want anymore. I'm an adult, I've been in contact with both ""sides"" of the story, I can make decisions on my own.

There were this person who was formerly a radfem in my country, they really used to shame trans people and bisexual women, but know they are openly trans non binary. When my girlfriend told me this story, I said ""well maybe they're more happy that way, don't blame them"", but my girlfriend didn't have the same thought as me. I got where did she came from ""how did someone, who was very 'political', changed so much? Didn't they learn anything?"" but I knew that people naturally change their beliefs and the most important thing is that they're more happy right now. I thought that, even while falling down the radfem pipeline. I'm afraid my girlfriend just shame me just like in this situation.
You do not need to tell your mom why you broke up with your girlfriend. You can say something generic like “we have different values and I found myself struggling to relate to her” and if your mom presses you can say “I don’t feel like talking about this, it was a really painful thing because of how well we did get along”.
Maybe you don’t need to think of it as breaking up with her because if your identity. Maybe it can be breaking up with her because she’s intolerant, lacks empathy, and seems to spend her time conjuring up problems to have with marginalized communities. It wouldn’t be unusual for a white person to dump their white partner for being racist. The same can apply here. You don’t have to wait until you feel sure about your identity to cut an intolerant person out of your life. And the truth is, you’ll probably find it easier to understand yourself once you don’t have her in your ear anymore
>She is wonderful in many things!

Is she? Or do you just overlook things because you love her, or you think its normal, or you force yourself to change your feelings to align with that belief? One of the patterns I notice with intimate couples is that one person will come and tell a horrific story about their partner not at all being a good person and yet they'll still consistently say that their partner is wonderful and supportive and so awesome. Then the more people point things out, the more realization the poster has that maybe things aren't as great as they had convinced themself. Of course, not every person is 100% awful at all times, but there is often a long-term thread of disrespect, insensitivity, lack of support and so forth. People will do a lot of mental gymnastics to not have to deal with the truth about someone they love.

>I'm afraid if I discover myself as trans non binary and be sure 100% I want to continue my transition, will she make fun of me? Will she say bad things just like she says about other trans people? Will she sees myself in a different way?

Yes, friend, she will. She has already showed you that. I really recommend you find a good trans-informed therapist to help you through this. and to help you better understand the ways you are ignoring keeping yourself safe. You're allowing your girlfriend to mistreat you because of the internalized transphobia you're feeling. It can be helpful in some way, because that outside source of disagree means you make more space inside yourself to come to terms with your truth. However, outsourcing that hate may not serve you anymore once you do start to claim being transgender. I think, in part, you're worried about not only how your GF will treat you but how you will treat you, how your parents will treat you, how your other friends will treat you. If you start building an inclusive support system now, it will help you so much with trying to make better decisions for yourself. I think it'll help you feel less like you'll lose everything because you'll already have people holding you up.
As for what to tell your mother, I wouldn’t tell her about your gender questioning until you are comfortable to do so (although frankly I have to say I hope you’re prepared for the possibility your hopefully-future-ex might use that against you to try to earn points in the realm of public opinion, although I DO hope she is a better person than that).

I would simply tell her that you found there were beginning to be topics that you didn’t feel safe talking to her about. That whenever those topics came up, your partner would say really dismissive, hurtful, and cruel things, despite you expressing that you didn’t like the way she talked about those topics. 

The ability to communicate openly with your partner is SO important to the health of a relationship. If you said that you didn’t feel “safe” talking about ANY topic with your partner, that would be a massive red flag for me, and it would be time to seriously reevaluate your relationship. Since this particular topic is so tied into who you are, and since her viewpoint is so steeped in bigotry, I’m inclined to say you’re just better off without her. But at the VERY least, maybe you can look into couples’ therapy (obviously with a well-reviewed LGBTQ+ positive therapist), and I hope you are also looking into some individual therapy to help you sort out your feelings around this and give you some guidance in establishing healthy boundaries so that you have the safety you need to explore your own gender identity.

Whatever you choose to do, I wish you well, my friend. Getting to know yourself is a lifelong endeavor. We never stop growing and we will never FULLY know ourselves, and that goes for gender too imo. I hope you find the support you need, whether from her or somewhere else, to find joy in the very act of working to know yourself better through discovering your gender. Maybe you are trans. Maybe you’re cis and you just want a different body. Maybe you’re some flavor of non-binary. Maybe your understanding of who you are will change over time. Whatever you are, you’re valid. And not knowing is valid too. It’s okay to be a work in progress. We all are. :)
I'm curious about your previous trans experience. When you where younger, were you trans masc/man instead of trans nonbinary? It could make sense if you were leaning male but then pulled back because it didn't feel right. 
I always knew I wasn't a girl, but being a boy only felt a tad better. I'm so happy to have gone down my journey to understanding and accepting being trans nonbinary. I don't do hormones but I have had a few surgeries and I love my body now. 
It's ok to considering changing parts of yourself that make you dysphoric. Even if you never change any of your ""labels"", it's ok to pursue what will make your body feel more like a ""home"" you want to live in. Please try to break up with this toxic person and find a gender therapist.
(funny we're name buddies now ^^)

i see... i think you are doing it right. taking time to think and sharing your thoughts with other people and your therapist. that's really good 👍🏻

i'm sorry that you're afraid of their reaction... but i guess when you're not hanging out with them it won't bother you that much anymore... i think if you're having other people you can count on, you will be okay :)

i'm happy for you that you changed and feel better about it now ^^ it really feels like you're going to be fine ☺️
probably she will.
I'm not being arrogant or wishing u bad things.

I'm someone who passed through a similar situation, but, he didn't saw me in my transition (my ex, that I did want to marry and blablabla).
When I told him, the first time, I was bissexual (years after, understood me as pansexual), he thought it cool. But when we broke up the first time and after a long, we came back and he knew, cuz I told him, I dated 2 girls, he got out of his mind. He used to say that I was confused and felt really bad about me having an affair with 2 girls while we were away from each other.
when we came back, he used to be openly bifobic to me and transphobic to others. 
I know that one of his cousins is trans. And he always have been the type of guy who thinks this is a bullshit created to put ""great and sweet"" people in a confused path.

I told a little about me just to say u: people who are openly lgtbqphobic, specially transphobic, they will not accept u as who u are. and depending on how they were raised, it gets worse.
u can try, talk and see what happens. but, we are not talking about ""she likes potato's and I like strawberry"". we are talking about ur self being and yes, she can shame u. in front of many people. or use u as a token to show how benevolent and lovable she is.
my ex always embarrassed me towards my sexual orientation. and used to use me as token for a fat poor lgbtqia person he was envolved.

don't be afraid to go.
if u want to talk to her and see how she treats u... it's upon u. 

hope she don't do anything bad to u or disrespectful.

if u wanna talk, my dm is open!
Seriously, I rarely tell my parents all the details of my breakups.
When I was younger I came out as a trans man to my friends and family, but after some years I started to question if I was non binary transmasc (agender, to be more specific). In any case, all this time I transitioned socially, I legally changed my name and all (and I'm glad I did it because I absolutely hate my dead name). But I wanted specially to undergo top surgery. I was really planning on that, it was my dream of life, I even emailed a doctor from my city asking for information). But when I found out I exclusively like women (after thinking I was bi for a long time), I came out as a lesbian. At first, I did still stick with the label non binary. For me it wouldn't make sense to call myself a straight trans male, since I resonate a lot with being a lesbian. My mother was so happy, she said out loud that she was glad I ""wasn't trans anymore"" and ""I'm so happy you love your body now"". What I think happened to me was: I tried to suppress my desire for transition and my different perception of gender so I can be more accepted and just be ""normal"" like everyone else. It kinda worked, but now I'm feeling dysphoric again and having trouble with how I perceive me. All this time I didn't stop wishing I was like the transmasc folks who have done the surgery nor stopped seeing myself in characters while have more masculine physical features. Right now I see myself as idk nothing? I do would like to be like a more tall, full flat chested with a deeper voice, but at the same time I see nothing about myself.
I'm so sorry your family and partner have been so negative. I'm no contact with my family and it's the happiest I have ever been. I know that no contact isn't the best route for everyone, but I realized that the relationships with my family were unbalanced in what I got out of it compared to what they expected me to to put into it. Nobody should feel required to be in a relationship that causes harm.... sorry for the tangent! haha  
What I came here to say is actually this: I am so very proud of you. I don't know if you realize this but you have taken some pretty big steps recently to look at what you need for yourself and what you need from a partner. Whatever you decide to do, even if it's nothing, please know that someone out there has a lot of respect for how you're addressing some really challenging issues in life. I hope that doesn't come off as condescending, I'm just speaking from experience and my experience is that where you are right now isn't easy, but here you are looking for advice and support. I support you."	121w0mq	NonBinary	347	0.99	2023-03-25 19:15:08
Feeling really good today. My binder often hurts me so days where dysphoria are low and I can go without it are great! 🌼		"Ever look into other binders? Theyre not supposed to hurt. The only time it should ever be uncomfortable is after a long time or wearing it. Good luck 💜
Handsome uwu
I have a larger chest and while it's not marketed as a binder I find that the enell high impact sports bra does rlly well in minimizing said chest (if it says anything I'm a uk 36K- so I'm unsure traditional binders would do much to begin with) and it's comfortable for long periods of time and well. It's a sports bra

It may not be what your after and it may not minimize/flatten your chest as much as you'd like but it is an option. I'm really happy today's a good day for you!
heck yeah you go!
Rest days are very important. I'm happy you're taking care of yourself 🌼💕
I might buy a new one in the future, but for now part of it is I wear mine for too long. After a while it begins to chafe around the arm holes and since I have DDs it’s hard choosing binders. I don’t want them to hurt but I also wanna be as flat as possible
Do you have any idea how long it’s been since someone called me handsome? My heckin soft boy heart fluttered 🥺💗💗
I have a small chest but I can definitely say that sports bras take them down as well as hide tits (if you don't want them seen, if I wear a thin bra I have to layer and make them appear large :P )
I saw this comment, and I have a bigger cup size as well, so this totally resonated with me. 

I use compression tank tops for my circulation issues, but they push my chest down so flat I don't really need to reach for a binder as long as I'm not wearing my tightest shirts. If you're looking for other options, that could be something else to check out, ymmv. 

You're totally rocking it without one in these pics, though!
Just be careful! Too much compression can lead to internal health issues.
Omg good 🥰
I hadn’t even considered compression tanks because I assumed I’d be too big for them, but if they work for you I might check em out! Thank you~
Yeahhhh, I know, I need to be more careful with my body. Thanks for your advice 💞"	qj18np	NonBinary	344	0.99	2021-10-30 13:13:42
Get vaccinated. I get to live with dysphoria because unvaccinated people are hogging all of the medical resources. Just got my surgery cancelled. Totally destroyed. Need community.	I was supposed to get the call to schedule my top surgery today after months of waiting in line and instead got a call to tell me that due to unvaccinated people getting sick and hogging hospital resources that all trans health related surgeries are cancelled. They think it will be at least a half a year until they even consider opening things back up. I'm back at square one trying to find someone that does non binary top surgery and it isn't looking good. The dysphoria is crushing and I can't stop sobbing. I had already been living with this for so long, it is hard to imagine waiting for who knows how long now. I really need some community support. Also, folks, not getting the vaccine is not a personal choice when it impacts other people.	"Mod note: Antivaxxers are not welcome here. Not this thread, not this subreddit. Get out.
I'm so, so sorry, BeanRiceNCheese. It's disgustingly unfair that you have to suffer longer because of other people's bad judgment. The only positive thought I can offer, as an old person, is that whatever else happens, the time keeps right on passing. The six months will elapse, and I hope that at that time, you will get your surgery and a big shot of well-earned euphoria.
You are absolutely right and that’s a very good example on how not getting vaccinated is not only stupid and dangerous, but also unbelievably selfish and a danger to society. I’m so sorry you have to go through this! I hope you find the strength to hang in there a little more, because all will be worthwhile after you get it done and look at yourself in the mirror 💜 And this sub is here to support you along the way! 💜
I’m sorry you and everyone else needing this healthcare is getting put on hold for other people’s dangerous choices. We’re here for you whenever you need someone to lean on until then. 
[offers digital hug] 💛🤍💜🖤
I'm so sorry this happened to you. It's disgusting how selfish people can be and how little they care about others.
I doubt it’s any help, but you are not alone in the least. This pandemic, now of the unvaccinated, hurts everyone who needs care. I read and hear stories from nurses all the time talking about patients who die in the ER waiting on a bed. People, like you, waiting on life changing surgery to improve their physical and mental health because of a pandemic of morons. Jobs ruined, lives lost, mental and physical suffering. You are so far from alone on this. I’m really sorry that this has happened and I hope something comes up soon for you.
Hugs 🫂
Mine hasn't been canceled yet, but I know it's probably going to happen. I work in a sister hospital to the one I'm supposed to have surgery in, and we've had surgical techs on our floor constantly because all elective surgeries have been canceled. As soon as they showed up, I knew it was gonna be bad news. I'm just waiting for the phone call. I'm so sorry this is happening to you.
I'm sorry. (I'm giving you my free award so that hopefully this will stay closer to the top of the page.)
*sending support*. That’s awful.
My surgery was programmed the same week the quarantine was first announced, I was devastated and fell into a dark hole of depression that left me with almost no memory of at least a couple months. There was no way to know when will surgeries be scheduled again, then I received a call, November that same year, to schedule my surgery for December.
Allow yourself to be sad, to be pissed and to process that frustration, but also think that eventually surgery will happen, you'll be back on track.
Hugs, I understand your frustration, I'm here if you want to talk
I love you, sorry this is happening.
I am so sorry. I hope you are well.
I'm so sorry that this has happened to you. It's incredibly unfair that other people's poor choices are making it so difficult to get gender-affirming surgery.
I'm sorry friend 😞

Those people sure do love to forcibly impose their freedoms onto other people.
People who refuse vaccinations shouldn't be entitled to healthcare. Simple.
I wanna get vaccinated so bad, but my mom has been putting it off for so long. It's super annoying. I'm so sorry that irresponsible and selfish people are taking away your chances of feeling happy and getting rid of this heavy weight on your shoulders. Do you do binding tho?
Hi! 
Several months ago you very kindly responded to my post about my top surgery getting delayed due to staff shortages in hospitals once vaccines were required for staff/covid in general (and our collective minds remain blown that people still don't understand covid somehow). 

I feel badly that I didn't respond to you at the time but I was in such a bad mental place. I didn't feel myself at all. Though all of the extra waiting certainly sucked, I have finally made it to the other side here. I'm about the weeks post-op and feeling like my body is finally a home I want to live in. Your kind words really made me feel supported at a time where I was feeling very alone and very hopeless. I just wanted to let you know that it turned out well, and that you made a difference in getting me through hard times, and that I appreciate you! 
PS I'm an ""old person"" at least in this community as well. Nothing like thinking you are AFAB for almost four decades to make coming out a complicated process! Ha!

Aw! Thanks so much for updating me, BRC! And congratulations on getting your surgery. I am thrilled for you that it happened and that it has made your live better. <3
Thank you so much for the good news! I’m very sad today because my cat is sick and your words made my heart feel a little lighter 💜 Have a great recovery 💜🍀💜🍀💜🍀
I'm so happy for you!! Thank you for the kind message and I wish you swift recovery <3
No problem! I’m really glad you found some solace in it. Congratulations on your surgery!! I’m sure it feels great to have that off your chest! 😂
I want you to know there is absolutely no reason to apologize for not responding because I totally understand that bad headspace. Mine was unfortunately canceled shortly after this, but the great news is that it got rescheduled fairly quickly and my surgery is actually this Tuesday! I do really appreciate you reaching back out and I'm glad you're on the other side and recovering well! Congratulations, my friend!
I'm so happy for you, wishing you the best through your recovery. Hugs!
Aww how kind of you to say! ☺️ No worries at all my friend, I'm happy you've been successful and are feeling a bit better now! I hope things continue to look up for you 😌 <3
I wish I'd actually been as supportive as some of the others here and not attacked antivaxxers.

I am glad things worked out and wish you a speedy recovery from surgery. Take care.
I'm so sorry about your cat being sick. It is heartbreaking when our furry friends aren't doing well. Partially due to the pandemic, I've gotten to a place where I like my dog better than most people and he is my closest friend. Sometimes people without pets don't realize that a sick pet is a sick family member. I'll be thinking of you both!
""Off your chest""—I laughed pretty hard at that!!!
Oh my gosh! Holy timing batman! I'm so sorry that this happened to you too and that you had the extra time/dysphoria that goes with it, but congrats on your surgery tomorrow!!!!!!!! Huge deal! If you have any questions about things as you go or just want the support of someone just a few weeks ahead of your own surgical experience feel free to reach out! There was a lot of ""is this supposed to be happening?"" for me and I'm happy to be another point of information if desired.
Actually, I'm not at all sad that you went after the antivaxers. In fact I think antivaxers are responsible for much larger problems than we are all talking about. We were already living in a highly ableist society but now, if you are a high risk individual like myself, having covid be reframed as an endemic effectively banishes us from society. I've not only lost my health from long covid (which I got before we even knew it was airborne-fun), but now because of antivax mentalities being validated as ""opinions"" I've lost the ability to participate in society. People (well now anyway) seem to comprehend the need to transform public spaces to be wheelchair accessable but don't see that we are collectively shunning high risk individuals and giving special rights to antivaxers (we all have rights until we infringe on someone else's rights and then we lose are rights but now we are not only not doing that but giving antivaxers the right to make other people ill). 
So, keep going after them. This is a huge issue that is very important. You will always have something they won't... The truth. 
Thanks again for the support and let me tell you, I really needed to hear exactly what you said that day!!!!"	qmsocx	NonBinary	338	0.99	2021-11-04 19:38:08
Sometimes I forget that in the future, it can get better and that dysphoria won't always be so prevalent (they/them)		"Your beautiful
Your face is gorgeous and you look androgynous🖤💖🖤🔥
idk if this is weird but you have such clear skin and i’m  so jealous
Nice finger guns
U looking kinda wholesome tho
You look very androgynous. Good job. Hope that your dysphoria gets better soon. ❤️
I feel the same. Also you look wonderful. :)
You are so beautiful!
Thank you <3
Thankkkkk, some times when I'm feeling a little dysphoric, I'll play around with face app, and when i did the""switch gender"" filter, almost nothing happened going back and forth and i was so happy
~~the lighting is helping haha~~
Thank youu, im getting there slowly, but it sure is a process
Thank you, it's no fun having to deal with stuff like that
Welcome ^>^ Holy shit that is a brillant idea. I've never thought about doing that to help with dysphoria! Thats awesome that there wasnt that much diffence on the app!
Same thing happened to me. It just cleaned my skin up a bit. That was a very gender affirming experience haha.
You're welcome. And yeah, it's pretty rough.
Thank you <3 yeah my friend showed it to me a while ago because i wanted to play with filters but snapchat ones are really over the top for me usually"	lzkjcl	NonBinary	331	1.0	2021-03-07 06:03:02
Experiencing dysphoria AFTER I realized I'm nonbinary?	"After I realized I was nonbinary, I became more and more uncomfortable with being perceived as a girl. Every ""she"" or ""her"" is like a dagger to the heart. I despise the idea of living the rest of my life as a girl but these feelings never came to me until AFTER I realized I was nonbinary? Is this normal?"	"It's very common, now that you have a better idea of what you want you're more capable of noticing when the world around you doesn't reflect that.

I'm sorry you're feeling this way, maybe you can balance it out by seeking out more validating experiences? There is a lot of joy in being nonbinary too.
I am going through the same thing. After realizing I was nonbinary, I feel like I started noticing gendered behaviors and language around me more often. I never realized how much of a box I had been put into until I started trying to move outside of it.
Dysphoria is the opposite of euphoria. Once you experience what feels good, you start having a reference point for your other experiences.
I definitely think dysphoria could increase once you realize what you could have as opposed to just dealing with what you cant change.
Thank god im not the only one that experienced this! I thought i was crazy for feeling dysphoric after the fact of realization!
I had very little social dysphoria until after coming out. Once I had indicated I wanted to be treated as a different gender the language others used for me became more important.
a really fun thing is that once you conquer one area of dysphoria (i.e. get top surgery), dysphoria in other areas can get worse (i.e. period dysphoria) because now your brain can focus in on one area of your body more closely. 

unfortunately that happened to me, but I was aware of this beforehand so that softened the blow.
This is the exact experience both me and my fiance had after coming out (both afab). I think we just become more and more aware of the fact that we aren’t girls and more comfortable and our identities as enbys. Totally normal in my opinion. Also when people misgender us it feels even worse than when we were still figuring our our gender identities cuz we’re secure and know that we’re in fact not a she.
This is probably how a vast majority of non-binaries feel. You don’t realize you have dysphoria until you experience euphoria! Being non-binary is a constant test of trying new things and experiencing as much as you can about gender, you have to have things to draw as baselines and comparisons to.

My revelation came pretty heavily when I let my gf do my makeup for the first time, and after that I started having dysphoria and came out to her.
i feel this and have thought i was alone tbh so just ty for posting this
I thought I was alone in this, it sucks but it helps to know we’re not all alone :)
Experiencing exactly the same thing. Currently struggling because I love my long hair but I know it’s a huge component to me being perceived as female. But I don’t want to do something I won’t actually like (shaving it) just because of the dysphoria of the assumption of female.
i read it once as like before realizing enby-ness, we were in a dark cave, didn't know about the sunlight or that the meadow outside existed. Then there's a cave-in and the bright light comes in and it can sometimes be scary to see the hole in the cave. Eventually when you venture outside and learn about how nice things can be, getting forced back into the cave is unbelievably terrible bc you now know what it can be. that's what i think of when i invalidate myself over this same situation, sorry that wasn't super well written.
yea very common. i started experiencing body dysphoria about a month after i realized i was non binary
This is pretty normal I think. I was actually quite proud of being a girl child and was fine with being gendered as female while in my questioning phase but I can't stand it now that I'm sure of my identity. I think it's because I understand for sure what is wrong and am more aware of my gender in general.
it’s been 2 years since i started my journey and i still feel this, and it didn’t start until after i realized i was enby. it’s normal, i promise. i’ll be honest, i struggle so much with my pronouns but all i know is that i’m not a girl, lol.

Yeah! Yep. I used to feel doubts about being NB because I didn't (consciously) experience social dysphoria (I realize now that is not that case at all, just didn't recognize it as such, then).

When I truly thought I was a cis woman:
""yeah I'm a girl, but not like how the OTHER girls are girls. When ppl use female gendered language with me, there's an unspoken 'not really but you know what I mean' btwn us""

Then when I first started self IDing as NB, I'd justify not changing my pronouns with ""I'm used to it, I've been tagging on the '*but not really' addendum in my head for so long, it doesn't bother me"".

However, now I get called ""miss"" at the store and have this 5 sec long brain fart, like ""miss? Wha? Who is this miss you sp--UGHHH, FUCK. I mean, why yes, of course, I am 'miss' 😑""

As of right now, I'm not out as NB at work and I have to make a conscious effort to remember to misgender myself when talking to my co-workers.

It is one hell of a mindfuck lol. AND awkward. I'll sometimes take a full second to pause as I try to remember which pronoun to use, like ""and so this guy was having a tantrum, pointing at me like... buhhhh...'SHE took my parking space'"".

I wonder if my coworkers notice.
This was how things went for me also. I tell myself I was better off oblivious because of it. But yeah, once that lightbulb went off and I “found” myself, she/her pronouns, miss, ma’am, lady, etc. were like  freaking bee stings all over
It's the missing denial, yeah.
i had this same experience! i realized i was complacent in being called a “girl” and once i felt what true euphoria was like, suddenly being called a “girl” and people using “she/her” hurt so bad. one time when setting up my laptop i broke down sobbing bc i was excited for it to be the first electronic i got that had no trace of the old me, but it went based off the only email i had at the time (which had my deadname and she/her pronouns). sometimes making the realization is what makes you start feeling the pain you grew accustomed to your whole life
I feel like now I know what it is, I’m more aware of it.
I (35afab) figured out only 3 years ago I was NB. And I had the exact same thing happen to me! I didn't have words for my gender identity but after I did my experience was the same as yours. I was fortunate for the first couple years I was in another state WA where the majority of the people around me respected my aversion to feminine adjectives and pronouns. Now I live in UT in a conservative Christian (fortunately not right-wing but still) household in where my request to be gendered correctly comes with with a 'this is not your house' 'your not the only one that has to live here' responses. Its a hard no from my parents on respecting my pronouns (they/them). Its a dagger everytime! I hold it in but break down about it every 1-2 months about it.
I relate to this exact thing. It sucks so much :(( Sometimes I wish I never realized I was nb because of how much worse the dysphoria is now
I feel like being detached from society. At first I thought I'd be trans until I realized I feel dysphoric over both male AND female perceptions. Every gender norm, stereotype, function in society, I can't live a normal life as a """"normal"""" human being bcs everything around me looks f up.

It's alright if you feel this way, dear. It's ok if you're in pain, you don't owe nothing to society neither have to follow their rules.
That's exactly my experience lol painful awakening though
Same thing happened to me. You’re not alone.
The very same thing happened to me!
same thing happened to me. when i was living as a girl there was just no hint that I had any like, say in the matter. if i was uncomfortable then like what could I do? now I have a say
Omg same
Oh, same! Though I realized soon enough, that those are not necessarily new feelings, but rather me noticing them. Like, I don't have a problem with pronouns, but here's a good example: compliments. I've never felt comfortable receiving compliments about my appearance. Like, how PRETTY I am, what an amazing FEMININE FIGURE I have, how MY LONG HAIR is beautiful. And like, I'm not even disagreeing with some of that stuff. My hair IS beautiful. But... it never felt right. I've dismissed it as an insecurity, but after I realized I was nonbinary those things stopped being ""meh"", and started to feel awful. Because now I knew what bothered me so much. Now it didn't just feel wrong somehow, I knew it WAS ACTUALLY WRONG to tell me smth like that. If before this feeling of wrong would just accumulate until I burst into tears seemingly for no reason, now each and every instance of misgendering hurts a bit more, but also, more obviously. It's transformed from depressive apathy into an actual pain. And even though it hurts, now I know what's wrong and can direct those negative feelings.
Don't know if it helps, but... I hope this pain minimizes for you.
It happened to me
It is the frustration of misgendering.
I’ve had the same experience. After I realized I was non-binary, gender dysphoria hit really hard
once you stop repressing you cant really go back. im the same way every misgendering is a stab in the back reminding me they just see me as a girl.
So happy I came across this post because it is the exact same way for me. It made my imposter syndrome way worse as I was constantly worried that my disphoria was just me trying to manufacture a justification from wanting to be an enby, rather than me actually being enby and actually having disphoria. I had more than enough stuff from my past pointing out that I wasn't cis so I eventually came to the conclusion that it was basically the not aware you're hurt until you see the injury trope.
In my experiences I've always felt mildly dysphoric but without realizing what that meant. I always assumed I was a girl and just went along with it. Then I cut my hair and noticed that I would default to dressing androgynously. When I finally realized I was libramasculine every time someone used ""She/her"" pronouns felt so very wrong. A good way to describe it is caring more about how other people perceive you than how you present. Like I hate it when people look at me and think ""oh girl"" like no, human brains are more complicated than this and I do not dress remotely like a girl. Society should learn to take a hint if people present a certain way. It's like ""Oh that person dresses in cargo pants and a bulky black jacket and has super short hair, I guess it's a woman"". Like stop. This isn't how you play the game.
You know when you listen to a song on the radio for the first time and thing “wow never heard that one before!”

And then you… keep driving… and every hour, on the hour, the song plays again…. and again… and again…

And when you finally have enough curiosity to look up when the song was made it turns out it is like ten years old and everyone else is already used to it? Yeah.
I knew “she/her” never really felt ok but it wasn’t until I realized that I COULD be nonbinary that I figured out it was gender dysphoria
Not just that but also the pushback from trying to move out of the box society has put one into causes distress. I never minded being perceived as a girl/woman until someone criticized or demanded certain expected behavior that did not vibe with me at that time, e.g. sitting in a feminine way (when I was wearing pants and no public indecency was committed)
Yes. It’s like never having anything besides bread but always being around other food. You have no idea what food tastes like other than bread. And eventually you get a taste of how good other food can be and now you’re confused every time someone takes it from you/says you can’t have it.
Yes this. Once I embraced being enby, I started trying out more femme things and they made me feel sooo good. Once I experienced that, the contrast between that and everything else was even clearer.
exactly this, I *was* experiencing dysphoria before I figured out I was nonbinary, but I never recognised it because that's just how everything felt all the time
Yes and no. Some people experience one, but not the other. For example, I only really ever experience dysphoria.
I'm right there with ya. Reproductive organs aren't important and can lead to cancer. Take them both out.
This! I'm questioning (but closer and closer to figuring things out), and one if the things that has confused me is this: as a kid, I (afab) played soccer with the boys, and when the coach praised ""good job, boys!"" I often yelled ""and girl!"" back. When I started questioning my gender, I thought of this as a sign that I must be cis. But what I really think it was is that I knew they all perceived me as a girl, so the coach just praising the boys excluded me in their eyes
I'm sorry you're going though this 😔 thank you for this comment tho I fully agree it was really helpful 💜
I’m sorry you’re struggling with this ❤️ I’m having a REAL hard time sorting myself out lately & you’ve put a lot of the feelings I’ve been having into words. I don’t see my experience reflected very much (which is kinda the most confusing part! Hooray!). Thank you big time! You’re not alone!
Similarly, when family members expect leg hair or armpit hair to be shaved, or expect you to have hair that isn’t “boyish” on your head. “That’s unladylike” has been thrown at me so many times now, but despite how many times I say I’m nonbinary, my family members refuse to remember.
I have my hysterectomy consultation tomorrow!

Cross-dressing party???	"hi everyone! i’m in need of a little help. So one of my friends is throwing a party next week to celebrate her first year on HRT/estrogen. She announced that the theme is “cross-dressing,” so the girls dress like guys, the guys dress like girls, you know how it goes. I’m here to ask for advice on how tf I can commit to the theme as a non-binary (AFAB) person. 

From what I can think of, my options are: 
- Go very femme/borderline drag. But I think if I have to show up in public in a dress/no binder when I already don’t look the most masculine, I’d throw up from dysphoria 
- Go very masculine, but then it gives the message that I’m a woman cross-dressing as a man. Again, so much dysphoria 
- Just wear one of my every day outfits and lay low, but I’m terrified that somebody’s going to gender my outfit since the literal entire theme of the night is gendering people. I do NOT want to know if I look especially feminine or masculine in one of my favorite outfits. 
- Just wear something funny, but I hate unwanted attention or being the one ToKeN NonBiNarY that can’t commit to the theme. 

Overall this whole thing is causing me so much stress and dysphoria. By definition, it’s physically impossible for me to cross-dress, and I’m very uncomfortable having to go to a party that’s entirely themed around the TWO GENDERS. I feel like I lose in every option I have. When I asked my friend what I should do, she just said “you’re already free from the shackles of gender, just come looking hot.” It was a nice sentiment, but it really doesn’t solve anything. I can’t not go; I really do love this friend and I want to support her, as we’re the only two trans people in this group. However, at this point I’m hoping I become gravely ill by next week so I don’t have to deal with this shit. Any advice on what I can do?"	"The only thing I can think of is a shirt with ""Binary"" printed on
a few ideas:
1. wear something “binary” - I’m picturing just black and white, and depending on how costume-y you want to go, you could draw 0s and 1s all over
2. wear both traditionally masculine and feminine pieces - someone suggested the classic tutu and blazer, you could also try a split-down-the-middle approach like Dean Pelton does in community, although this would probably be much more work. you could also do a simpler outfit and then makeup that’s “boy” on one side and “girl” on the other
3. take your friend’s advice to heart and just show up looking hot! wear your favorite fancy outfit that you’re comfortable in. i’m sure all of the binary people at the party will understand that the theme puts you in a pickle and will just think you look cool as heck
Dress as a cross. Like go as a giant X. You are now cross-dressed. You win the party.
Suit jacket w frilly tutu
it sounds like your friend is helping to normalize non traditional gender expression by playing to what people intuitively understand (for the normies who aren’t nb, trans, etc)

as she said, the “cross dress” label isn’t for you, it’s for the others, so wear whatever you want!
Now I can't stop thinking of a t-shirt with ""ToKeN NonBiNarY"" on it. That's what you should wear
Okay so literally 2 weeks ago was my birthday and it was crossdressing themed! The way I sold it to my guests was ""i am going to trans all of you unless youre already trans in which case I'm not gunna detrans you, so dealer's choice""

People dressed up as much as they felt comfy; my cis girl friends looked like professors lol. I put my bf in one of my old prom gowns and did his makeup.

The point is to have fun, normalize GNC presentation, a̶n̶d̶ ̶g̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶e̶g̶g̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶o̶p̶p̶o̶r̶t̶u̶n̶i̶t̶y̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶t̶r̶y̶ ̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶a̶n̶o̶t̶h̶e̶r̶ ̶g̶e̶n̶d̶e̶r̶
Cover yourself in zeros and ones.
Spacesuit! 

Or another full-body costume that’s wildly removed from your general presentation. 

Some ideas: 

One of those funny full dinosaur air-suits, or Pjs/ onesies 

Any kind of animal onesie that you love wearing. They have unicorns, dragons, and of course all manner of earthly ones 

Mummy costume, full coverage, gender is “dead” 

Robot costume (bonus: runs on binary code)

Jesus H Christ, easy and full coverage, and potentially very gender, with long hair + beard + robes + jewelry

Any genderless Pokémon; Ditto, or many of the legendaries

OP, it totally makes sense that the theme of this party feels uncomfortable, because it is leaving you out. That sucks. I hope you can find a way to creatively and comfortably work the theme, and be in attendance with your friends 💚
You don't have to dress after a theme if it makes you uncomfortable. You don't even have to go if you don't want to, but I don't know how your relation to that friend is. Just dress how you feel comfortable! If someone gives you shit, they take the whole theme thing too serious and are not worth talking too.
If you were near me, I'd loan you my ""Miss Octoberbreast"" Halloween costume. It's worth it for the booze dispensing fake breast appliance.

Violate the whole binary concept with as much prejudice as possible.
You could dress as an alien/fairy/witch/elf/any non human and say you're cross dressing as a different sentient being
Left half femme right half masc? but keep the binder and use a balloon for your one boob
I think the last two are your better options. The ""tutu and blazer"" idea isn't bad, but might be louder than you'd like.

 Would you feel better with a ""genderless"" option? My first thought was all black like a stage hand, black T-shirt and black pants. But any kind of outfit that makes it obvious you're dressing up without giving any kind of gender cues would work.

The other option world be to break out some trans pride merch. It doesn't go along with the request to cross dress- but shows support to your friend and I think fits the spirit of the event.
maybe you could try wearing both masc and fem clothes at the same time? since I'm assuming you're not a guy or a girl, technically by wearing both at the same time you would be crossdressing
I want to say something feminine and something masculine at the same time (a skirt and cargo pants to put an example).
You could go masculinizing makeup (maybe even beard?) And dress/femme attire.

Alternatively, there are certain styles that read as ""feminine man"" more than ""woman"", so you could look to twink fashion for inspiration.

Obviously none of these are keeping to the exact letter of the theme, and to a certain extent what'll read as ""cross-dressing"" for you might depend on your usual aesthetic (and it's very possible there is no straight-up opposite for you) but there are likely ways to play with gendered clothing that convey something different than your usual style without defaulting to one side of the binary or the other
Split down the middle? M/F
Get pirate costume -> show up as Barbossa -> do NOT forget a green apple
This really rubs me the wrong way. Like it feels the equivalent of someone asking you to show up as your agab. I don’t know maybe just me.
Is it too dysphoric to try and represent both binary genders in the same outfit? Something exaggerated and outlandish that represents both, none, or all the gender. A suit and tie top with a tutu bottom, a fake beard with frilly blouse and a kilt. Solid black body suit so you're a void. If that's too much the ideas of playing on a binary t-shirt or binary code is fun!
You've said so much about everyone else but so little about yourself - how do you usually look? I would play with subverting my own personal self expression in some way
Wear an outfit so ambiguous that they’ll never know what the gender is. I.e. wear a hotdog suit
Uh we had a ""tradies and ladies"" dress up day at highschool in my last year so I went as a traffic cone . Idk if that helps lol
I second the comments saying “split down the middle”; if you’re comfortable doing makeup you can do some neat illusions with contouring opposite ways on both sides of the face! Drag King 5 o’clock shadow or beard with mascara-thickened eyebrows on one half, femme drag style in the other, etc., you could even go glitterbeard on one side in juxtaposition to same color eyeshadow on the other or something.
Hair can be gelled back or spiked only on half or swept to one side completely if it’s long enough.
Maybe a masc watch on one hand and long nails on the other?


For clothing I often go with the ‘nice shirt and pants and vest’ combo which reads fairly gender neutral to me, but also this old black and white photo of a performer who made their own outfit completely split down the middle between a dress and I think a tux comes to mind.  I can’t for the life of me remember their name or find the image but they were serving both looks so good!
Slightly off topic suggestion, but could yall get little nametags to wear and put your pronouns on? Like the disposable ""hi my name is ____"" ones. It doesn't relieve a lot of your stress, but it should at least cut back on you getting misgendered based off whatever conclusion people may come to based on your outfit.
Some people said go as ""Binary"" but I got a creative twist to it: get a white shirt and dye one half pink and the other blue.  Write on the front: ""Gender Reveal"".  You don't have to do anything really flashy either, just wear whatever you'd normally go with along with the shirt.
Use a shirt with a big question mark on it and if someone asks then tell them you're crossdressing as someone who questions their gender.

Or come dressed in your most comfortable wear. Like a hoodie and sweatpants or whatever is comfy for you. Explain that you had a bad day and just want to party. Or write it on a sign or the back of your hoodie. 

Or you could make your own twist on the theme. Most of the people will probably go with stereotypical dress codes for the ""opposite"" gender(skirt/dress/suit/jeans-&-hoodie), so come dressed as something that breaks those codes. Come as a cute femboy, a butch lesbian or as a flamboyant gay.

Or dress after a certain style, like emo or goth etc. Some styles are already kinda gnc with its presentation.

Or dress like a celebrity, like Freddie Mercury or David Bowie.
My suggestion is a shirt covered in binary code or something else computery themed, ""Look, I came as binary"". But also if it's making you anxious to the point of wanting to be ill, I'd recommend a serious sit down with your friend just how much this is impacting you. It's possible she misunderstood your first talk as just casually asking for recommendations, but of course you know your friend better than me in that regard.
How would you feel about doing both? Like one half very feminine, one very masculine?
Dress as your “opposite”, like a person who actively enforces binary genders, especially rigid gender roles.  Priest/Nun/Pope 

If you’re not into sports, maybe a sports superfan with a painted face and everything. 

Or maybe choose to do drag with something other than gender.
I'm picturing one of those outfits where one half is masculine and one half feminine but that's a lot of work for a bit
I think going half and half would be perfect, go from having no gender to having all the binary gender
I’d mix super feminine and super masculine because the opposite of neither would be both, right? Glam winged eyeliner, drawn on beard, maybe a dress with a men’s suit jacket and shoes?
Oof I feel for you, that’s a tough spot to be in!

I’m curious if the folks that will be at the party are people who know and support that you’re non-binary? I imagine that would change the way they may engage with you about the costuming aspect of the party. Also, do you have a few close friends going who you could tell in advance about your worries and could be a safe place to go to if it’s feeling challenging? 

You could also plan something gender affirming in the days after the party. I find that there are some spaces that I want to be in for various reasons, like connection to the particular humans, but that take a toll on my sense of self, and my gender in particular if it’s a pretty cis space. And being with people and in spaces that are gender affirming can help counter that for me.

I also wonder if it might help to try to visualize in advance how you might respond if someone engages with you about what you’re wearing. Is there a way to feel any lighter about it but also firm in who you are?

I’m trying to imagine what I would do in your position. In my best imagining… I think wear my normal clothes (which are basic guy vibes) and take an attitude of - I’ve already shaped my gender identity, I’m just here to chill and spectate on the people this theme actually applies to 😄

If it’s really not feeling good for you to go, maybe you can find something else to do that night that’s really right for you (even though it would be a bummer to miss your friend’s gathering). And if you go, you can also leave it anytime!

Wishing you luck, and many future party themes that are euphoria enducing, not the other way around.
It seems to me like the point is to make other folks do something they would not normally do and challenge their own notions, so along those lines, it seems to me going full femme/borderline drag option makes the most sense, to also have you out of your comfort zone. Otherwise going NB but turn the dial way up on intensity? I do like your friends advice here and I would tend to just take her at face value and do that barring other options
Think of it as a stereotype party. Go hard into the stereotype of one or the other gender. Or maybe be a really feminine man or manly fem. The point is to have fun with it. Don't stress and if it is stressful just go as yourself. No one wants you to suffer over it
Wear something you have always wanted to wear but felt shy about being judged. This is an opportunity to shine in all your brilliance and wash the binary expectations away. If everyone is pushing their gender exploration to the max you will not stand out uncomfortably ♥️
i think you should just do half man, half woman, like dean pelton from community.
Wear something in white, something that you like, and write a lit of zeros and ines on it (binary)
maybe it would work for you if you leave your gender-expression ambiguos put like turn it up to 110%. Something where evereybody goes: 'Idk what gender this is suposed to be but it is certainly performative!'

I'm thinking of something along the lines of Dorian Electra's first outfit in their '[Agenda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq9PJsS3-EY)' music video, but like adapted so that it works for you. But maybe you have a total different idea for inspiration or a way different understanding of what 'genderless gender-performative' could mean.

Hope you'll find a way that works for you. Good luck!
If you don't want to go for the binary joke, maybe get a fem outfit, still wear a binder and do drag make up? Like making clear you being female is an over the top performance?
This is weird, but can you go half and half? Like super masculine top and a skirt?
Go as a mythical creature or an alien; something other worldly
I would have fun with mixing the two binary gender stereotypes into one outfit in an exaggerated way.
Mash the extremes of gender together, or just go as a cis person lol. I'm going to a party in a corset, I'll be showing a lot of cleavage and wear make up, but I'll also be wearing a glitter beard (might use a packer we'll see lol).
Half of each split down the middle
wear whatever makes you feel most comfortable
Go as a ghost. You're usually alive, now your not. Crossing them mortal lines. Do one of those 50/50 outfits split down the middle, like half bride half groom.
Wear only stark black and white.

Seriously, if it were me, I see 2 options. First, just ask the friend what they think works. Second, just don't go. Missing one party won't kill anyone.

I mean, I guess if you really wanted to do it up, go as an exaggerated version of both sexes.
I personally would maybe go femme-ish drag but with a glitter beard…. Which is pretty non-binary…. But idk, exaggerated so I feel like it sort of fits. Like cross-dressing and drag are related.

I would go ahead and wear a binder and contour an Adam’s apple and a stronger jawline.  But with Trixie Matel style face make up.  For clothes… anything that makes me feel Iike a badass. Maybe a long jacket or leather? Idk. I wouldn’t wear anything that made me feel uncomfortable, only things that made me feel awesome.

I’d just have fun with it. If I was having fun with it I think that would be fitting with the theme of the party. And a glitter beard sounds like so much fun to me, especially with some amazing eye make up, maybe even in nb flag colors…

A lot of people who do drag are doing it of their gender. Trans men do drag kings, trans women do drag queens. Why not do a drag-khan (khan is the only ruling title I can think of that doesn’t have a gender… Caesar maybe too? Tho there never was a woman Caesar, I don’t think it is inherently gendered…. 🤷🏻)

Hope that helps. And I hope you have fun at the party. Good luck!
Dress as an animal or something nonhuman?
I'd probably wear a t-shirt/polo and cargo shorts with striped thigh high socks or really obvious tights (fishnets maybe), so I hopefully look like a golfer dad with fem socks. The socks/tights would clash with the look and make it look both masc and fem at the same time but hopefully not triggering dysphoria the way a skirt or dress would. I've done this as a transmasc trying to look like I was crossdressing as feminine and I ended up looking like I tried to be male and female and failed at both.
Go as an alien.
Maybe see how much room you’ve got on the vertical axis of the gender spectrum, i.e. if you’re more agender go BIG GENDER or vice versa? Make your gender a completely different flavour of nonbinary (but legible for cis people to still see it as gender-weird)
Dress as a non-human. Alien? Lamp? Mushroom?
Go as a cis white maga male/female.  Can’t be anymore opposite.
If you are no gender, then be all gender
I would do something like, alien/outer space themed or fantasy themed. Like the opposite of your gender doesn't exist so you go as something ""made up""
Unicorn onesie.
Dress as a cross?
Non binary can be thought of as zero gender, cross dressing is the opposite gender, opposite of zero is zero(correct me if I'm wrong about anything in this comment)
Go with a cardboard box costume lmao
[thought of this!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Joseph) also forewarning there’s some outdated terms used in this article because of the time it took place in
OP I'm sorry you're being put in this situation :( I think it's totally reasonable for you to skip the party if you aren't comfortable attending. It's wonderful that you want to support your friend, but you need to look after yourself as well. Maybe get your friend a gift to celebrate instead, and politely bow out? 

To be perfectly honest, I think it's thoughtless of your friend to have decided on a theme that not all her guests could enjoy. Especially when she probably understands what disphoria feels like herself. Why not have a good old fashioned ABC party instead or something?
Lots of people saying to do a little of both, but it sounds to me from your post like those would just make you feel dysphoria x2. I know you're worried someone will try to gender your outfit, but I think if people see you're just wearing all beige or all neutral colors or something, they'll be able to tell you haven't chosen one. I think a lot of people will ask about it when they see it too, which goes against your desire to lay low but means no one's going to misgender you bc they'll have talked to you. Another idea is to wear one of those name labels they give you at some events to write your pronouns on, if you don't use exclusively she or he. I'm genderfluid, so I use she and they and recently have been trying the occasional he. If I just wrote she/they/he in Sharpie on a label and stuck that on, I think people would understand that no matter what genders they may ascribe to the outfit, I'm non-binary. I hope one of these comments helps!!
You should reach out to your friend about your anxiety! There might be other NB people going and you could ask what they are wearing.
1) Take your friend’s advice and wear whatever makes you feel good. 

2) Non binary flag theme with either the colours or a flag pin or something. 

3) Your peak gender envy/euphoria idol. Dress as anyone who inspires feelings of gender euphoria for you.

I don’t think the theme “cross-dressing” is meant to apply to you, your friend doesn’t think so, so it’s just “you do you.”

That said, the theme is very non-binary unfriendly.
come looking like a creature of the undead. wear a black shroud and hover ominously in the corner. answer anybody's questions with cryptid prophesies and sighs.

but dude that sucks. i hope you figure out what to do. being nonbinary is a form of cross dressing already since you're crossing out of the binary. it's countercultural and awesome in it's own right. no matter how you feel before during or after this or what people say or think of you, you're still inherently nonbinary and no one can tell you different.
to your second idea- maybe wear something feminine, doesn’t have to be a dress maybe skinny jeans and a feminine sweater and wear a binder and makeup to make you look masculine and maybe add a beard. if you have short hair wear it as is or if not maybe wear your hair up in a hat - go for the look like you were amab dressing feminine?
go half and half
I'd probably not go 😬 this sounds like hell

If I were to go I'd do aspects that are both very traditionally seen as masculine AND feminine. Like, wear a fancy dress & draw on a beard (or if you're on T and grow ome yourself then don't shave). Or do it the other way around and wear a suit if you have one or grey sweatpants, a tanktop, and heels & lipstick (I like that option better  because it sounds hilarious)

Also do your friend know you're enby? Because then mayne they can be more considerate and not gender anything

Edit: I didn't read the whole text. Since your friend is supportive you can do whatever you want but my suggestions still stand
First things first; you're under no obligation to go and do a thing that could be harmful to yourself. You have every right to not go entirely because it may not be the right time for you to be engaging in this kind of presentation. 

Where I'm at right now, I think I'd struggle the same way, my style is probably still viewed by most as kinda femme but for me its neutral enough, its what i like.

&#x200B;

If I got asked to go some place and wear a body hugging top or had to show off my figure, I'd struggle and feel awful. I've been wearing a binder for like...a year and a half or so now and going without it gives me such dysphoria, which....Id' sort of had before but while its better with my binder on, now...yeah, without, its like 'ugh...boobs' 

&#x200B;

So I understand, and not that you need it from some random stranger but you entirely have my permission to beg off on the day of, if its too much. Dont put yourself through anything damaging and I'm sure your friend would understand if you told them 'its just too soon for me right now' 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

that said if you do want to go...

Coooould you lean in and do half and half? Like literally left and right sides, one half femme, one masc, split down the middle? its a bit of sewing work putting, say, a skirt with a trouser leg, but could maybe hit that middle vibe?

Or just mix it all up. Wear a skirt, but also get a lace front thick as fuck beard, rock a short hair style but clip a bow in it, big thick masc eyebrows, softer feminine lipstick colours.

&#x200B;

If asked 'Im every gender and none, bb, gender is a construct, we're vibes' 

&#x200B;

I hope you work something out, and if you do go, and wear a LOOK, if you're confident I'd love to see it so we can cheer you on in all your gorgeous NB power.
I’d show up in my octopus onesie and say “somewhere I along the line I got confused by the premise”
Go as a scarface (ob neside make up fem other mas) and then choose contradicting outfits like topas / fem bottom half the other way or choose diffrnd shades of a color ans go as the spektrum to show there is more inbetween. Or use a shirt with print on it insicating your status as third gender like non binary ore a 404 erroe gender not found thing
i think you should take your friend’s advice! she clearly considered that this theme might be stressful and outside of your comfort zone, you should just wear whatever you feel best fits the occasion. don’t force something that will make you uncomfortable, it’s not worth being “in theme” if the dysphoria potentially ruins your night
The opposite of halfway in the middle is still halfway in the middle, just go as a different flavor of non-binary.
There's so many good ideas, I'm interested to know which is OPs favourite
It’s WILD to me that your friend chose this theme.
Just wear a garbage bag or something lol
Androgynous drag!! Idk if it's a thing yet but if it isn't we just invented it. Grt both hyperfem and hypermasc features in your costume. That way its the same exaggerated femininity/masculinity as I drag, but still not binar
Wear your binder, do drag king style makeup, but wear extremely flamboyant women’s clothes
Go dressed as a gender reveal party?? Like a confetti cannon covered in pink and blue question marks! And then when people ask what the gender is, throw rainbow confetti at them and say “yes”
Numerous options are accessible online. Shop there at your convenience.

Many of the people I've met through [TS Dates](https://datingadvocate.com/ts-dates) have fantastic suggestions for neutral attire. You could learn from them as well.
Or one that’s printed in 0s and 1s
Oh, or if you have a microlabel, something with a flag that somewhat feels opposite to that. But I think both might count as funny, so. *sigh*
Please. This.
Not sure if OP would be comfortable with this but it’s a brilliant idea!
That’s an awesome idea
I vote two or three.
I just had the same idea and wanted to post :) Don't dress like a person, dress like a system - the binary one. Go full black and white ([checkerboard pants ](https://www.zalando.de/vans-stoffhose-checkerboard-va221a01r-q11.html?size=32&allophones=0&wmc=SEM490_NB_GO._7713128529_677835352_33308218703.&opc=2211&mpp=google|v1||pla-360989572517||9043920||g|m||147910107582||pla|VA221A01R-Q110032000|360989572517|1|&gclsrc=aw.ds) and a half black, half white [shirt](https://a.co/d/5oCs6iG)) or pink and blue. Don't overthink it. It's a party! You're supposed to be having fun. No one's going to be mad, if you just wear some of your regular partying clothes and some glitter stickers on your cheeks or something.
""Oh, that kind of crossdressing. How is that my fault? Next time be more specific!""
Or, providing none of your friends are particularly devout, go with a crown of thorns and a crucifix 😅
Haha, what a great idea!
The Luz Gambit can't fail. And it has a high chance that the night ends by vanquishing demons alongside your future romantic partner!
Brb making this shirt 🤣
This
Found it take my vote lol 😆
i thought of this too lmao
Also clarifying that I'm also afab nb. I consider myself transmasc so I went for a masc look overall, but you could also mix and match gendered signifiers eg: wearing makeup and a packer and a mascara mustache. I'm sorry the whole affair is sparking dysphoria however :/
Ooo. I could see like a Riddler suit outfit but 1s and 0s instead.
I went straight to this thought as well. 

Just wearing the shapiest, most gender-blurring outfit possible.
Like the Dean from community
Yeah that was sort of my first thought too. Like I appreciate that OPs friend isn't expecting them to actually come up with some sort of costume for the party but that still leaves them sticking out (or would encourage people who dont know OP to assume theyre crossdressing when they are not). It's rather thoughtless of them.
can you expand on this please, like did you just get a big cone and cut a hole in it or what
>No one wants you to suffer over it

love this input \^
lol to ghost :)
This one is funny, I second this.
ooh kinda dark I like it haha
This all sounds wonderful and I'm very glad for you; just stopping by to say I'm now waiting for an opportunity to try fake lashes as a moustache (also afab nb)
Yea I don't know this all sounds like a badly written b horror movie. Like even from the cis friend point of view what is the point in doing this to make you feel uncomfortable in the way a Trans person does.
I went to a costume/party store and found a foam material traffic cone hat and then just wore that with my usual outfit which was jeans and a top lol. A real cone would've been too uncomfy
idk how well fake lashes work but what they were saying, using mascara to shade facial hair onto ur existing invisible face hairs? works very well especially if u buy lighter colors than black lol
Last year I tried to make a prosthetic mustache out of hair from my last haircut but it was kinda unwieldy haha
The friend hosting the party is trans! She really has no excuse not to get why OP is struggling with this. Ugh I feel so bad for them :(
I know that's what I'm saying it's like the host wants everyone to feel uncomfortable. It really just makes no since you should be able to celbrate this with your friend as either cis or non binary without having to check off a really weird check box.
Ooh I see what you're getting at. Yeah it is odd. Even if she's doing in an attempt at breaking down barriers or something, the position she's putting her nb friend in is totally undermining whatever good intentions she might've started out with  :/ Like there are so many themes to choose from, maybe go with one that doesn't put a specific guest (and her friend!) completely on the spot, Jesus 🤦"	ye19v9	NonBinary	319	0.99	2022-10-26 15:45:09
I got a breast reduction a while back because of chronic headaches and even though I still want top surgery it helped a lot with dysphoria. Anyway I just thought I would share the results :) ( he/they)		"You look great!! :D
Sorry, you teet yeeted for headaches? I've never heard of that before.
wait wait wait boobs cause headache?????? so this might be why my head hurts so much??? god another reason to choppity chop them off
Looks great dude! I'm really thinking about getting a reduction too someday, or maybe even top surgery. We'll see. :]
I got a reduction too! For me it was back strain because I didn’t know I was trans yet lol. After having a normal proportional body to work with, I figured it out lol
You're saying headache can be a reason?!  


I have migraines about once every 2 months. I wonder...
Damn dude looking good!
That's so flat! You look great
You look fantastic! P.s. I love your style
You look great! (Also, like many others have said I had no idea my migraines could be linked to my large breasts. Considering reduction a bit more now...
Guess I'm gonna have a lot of headaches in the future lol
Thank you!
Yeah so they were heavy enough to probably cause quite a lot of strain on my back which in turn probably effected my posture which may have given me headaches. I have no way of 100% knowing that is what caused them but it is one of the reasons I could get the operation done and the headaches left with the titties.
Oh wow, that's amazing. I'm so pleased for you"	r8ya7f	NonBinary	313	1.0	2021-12-04 20:25:07
I shaved off a ton of hair, and then added extensions. Gotta love my backwards way of dealing with dysphoria!		"Really I just wanted to mix the two hair styles of my two favourite (male) music artists. :) It makes me feel great tho!
Looks gr8!! I 💜💜💜
I'm OBSESSED with this look 😍
This is one hell of a look. I'm in awe, I'm inspired, I love it!
Okay this is a whole look but specifically I love those sunglasses
You look absolutely stunning, I love the look. Plus are you a witch? I love the necklace
Is that an Undertale Heart Locket? Love your look!
That's a hell of a look! Go you!
WHAT IS THAT PLANT NECKLACE?!?!? I have to know.
Wow you're cute!
Wow this looks so great!
Hair gooooals!!!! You look amazing!

I actually have the same hairstyle, and a similar pink color, it's just not very long yet. I was considering giving myself bangs, but wasn't sure how it would look/work out with this hairstyle. But seeing how perfect it looks on you makes me feel like I have to do it now! Thank you for sharing! Also, those sunglasses are totally rad!
Thank you 💕
Thanks! You can't go wrong with 3 different shades of black! :D
Thanks! The glasses were from Top Shop!
Thank you! I'm not a witch, but I wouldn't rule it out. I have a few books around on the subject :)
It sure is! I adore that game. 💕

I'm afab and have always gotten dysphoria wearing women's clothes, especially short skirts. But this weekend, I found the only skirt I will ever happily wear!		"I still have to wear shorts underneath and I'm barely comfortable wearing this skirt, but it was $5 at Goodwill (no brand logos or anything, so unfortunately I think it's homemade) and there was no way I was not buying it.
[deleted]
I love it!! and for $5, thats a great price!
Dr who 💕
I have a few whovian shirts I like.
It looks good, go off
very happy for you :)
I need one!
Yes!
That's such and awesome find! I love it! You have excellent taste.
That's absolutely amazing I love it
You could wear tights under it (leggings?)
It can fit sharks underneath, so I would say yes.

(I have a pair of shark shorts I wear underneath it because I hate the feeling of bare thighs touching)
I literally saw TARDIS anything and didn't even try it on in the store, because it was going to fit no matter what. :)
Hahaha, that is perfect! I did the same thing when I found a TARDIS t-shirt at the thrift shop, it was in my basket so fast. :)"	pani6g	NonBinary	303	0.99	2021-08-24 13:38:03

Hey everyone! Greetings and Best Wishes from Portugal! First post here, finally had the guts to introduce myself onto you guys. Thank you for making me understand who I am! Any tips on how to look more androgynous? Dysphoria has been being a butt lately		"you look very androgynous to me! error _404 gender not found_ 
i don't have tips I'm sorry but you look great! good luck!
Honestly, it’s kinda hard to tell where you’re starting from. If I saw you I’d guess male, so maybe lean a bit more towards feminine. If you’re AFAB... Wow, good job.

Also I should get sweats too...

You look like Andy Black... I have found my Kryptonite.

Sorry my sex drive keeps interrupting my brain... stupid Testosterone.
You look amazingly enby and so good!  I wish I looked half as androgynous as you!

Also, sweatpants hide all. Why do I not have any?
You look amazing!! I dunno why you need tips, to be honest, you look incredibly androgynous already- I think I should be asking *you* for tips :P 

Personally, I like to wear clothes that are a bit looser, with boxy fits instead of tapered ones. I also tend to bind if I’m wearing tighter shirts, but that’s about it, I think.
I think I just started drooling... I love piercings.
Gender.exe is corrupt please format! Lol
You look great! goals honestly
You look amazing. Abraço, pá!
you look fantastic! Ethereal even :3
to be honest you have that androgyny going on anyways!
You do look pretty androgynous, although if your feeling it's not enough, something small and feminine would look nice :D like some nude eyeshadow and mascara would really tie the look together :)
You’re AFAB? If anything your problem is you pretty much pass as male, but I bet in person up really confuse people.
Thank you so much for your kind words!! It really really means a lot. Plus, I'm a programmer and that that 404 got me so good xD
Really?! That's awesome! I'm AFAB o.o does that mean I peaked? xD

Sweats. Are. The. Best. Thing. Ever. Highly recommend.

I was obsessed with BVB as a teenager, you have no idea how completely blown away I am with that comment. I wanted to look like him so much at the time that I even started wearing the same hair and make up. To hear this now is just... surreal. Thank you! Really...

It's okay, my friend. I suffer the same and I don't have Testosterone to blame it on. Just be yourself! Who cares for you will love you for however you are. Testosterone in the way or not :)
Thank you so much darling! I'm sure you look freaking great for sure. 
Sweat pants are the best thing ever to me I swear. Super comfortable and super good at hiding my huge ass thighs. 
Honestly, get some. On those days where you just wanna be around and about and get loose, it's the best
Thank you so much for your encouragement. Truly. It means so much. 
Anytime I get the opportunity to do so I try my best to wear baggy clothes that hide my figure. I don't have a binder yet so I've using sports bras to try to make up for it.
I'm somewhat new to presenting androgynous so I'm kinda trying not to mess it up xD
Username checks out xD

Piercings and tattoos are like Hmpf... I get it, totally get it (and thank you for the appreciation ;))
Aaaaawe thanks! I'm sending you my biggest internet hugs!
Muitíssimo obrigado pa! Um abraço gigante
Woah! Thanks! Ethereal?! No way I could have ever anticipated that one, most original description I've ever had the pleasure of reading/hearing.

Thank you so much for your support! Together we are strong :D
Picture was taken on Christmas Eve chilling at home sporting the t-shirt my girlfriend gave me so look was tons chill. 

Mascara and some eyeliner are my go to's if I wanna edge it out a bit further. Thank you! Now I know I'm following the right path :D. Truly thankful.
Yeah I'm afab xD. I've had some confusion yes but my voice and height usually gives it away too xD
haha! what a coincidence! not a problem at all kind stranger
Yeah I would have guessed AMAB. Not that it matters much to me much in terms of sexy times, just means I do things a bit differently.

I loooooove BVB. I just got into their stuff a few months ago, and that was sort of what triggered me figuring out I wasn’t female. (“He’s wearing makeup and looks kinda femme, but not female... but he looks ridiculously hot... You can *do* that?!”) I almost called myself Andy for awhile there, haha.

I wish I could look like them, but that’s not gonna happen... I’m short and naturally a bit pudgy. Also I’m turning into one hairy little mofo, so I’m going to start going for a “genderqueer hobbit” vibe instead. (The difference between non-binary and genderqueer eludes me, since they both fit pretty well on me.)

Sweatpants it is. I’m thinking of setting up a merch store called the Genderqueer Hobbit and I’m going to have to make sure I make sweatpants.
You’re already doing great, trust me!
I was actually trying to be a tattoo artist for awhile there. XD
Much appreciated friend!
well I’m glad you liked the compliment :) 

Yes! 💕
Good to here :) no problem
Keep being your wonderful self and good luck on your endeavors! Rest assured today, you made a difference in someone's life
I think Andy was the cause of some of my mannerisms at a young age and morphing into androgyny even without realizing it. If he was a ""boy"" and I was a ""girl"" he can do it, so can I.

I'm also super short, don't let it get you down. I'm naturally super hairy too. You can work around all those things, don't beat yourself down for it. You can achieve everything you set yourself to, you just have to start from the inside out. Build up that confidence you buried deep and let it shine through little by little.

Chin up Buddy! You got this!
Thanks to people like you that support us all the way! Thank you for being who you are :D
Same. And then suddenly turned programmer. Go figure xD
that makes me insanely happy, have a nice day!!
You are so freaking nice how is that possible
My girlfriend’s reaction to Andy Biersack: 

Her: WHOA THEYRE HOT HOLY SHIT
Me: He is so fucking hot

Her: He looks like he’d be at least bi come on
Her: No sexy man isn’t bi

I’m non-binary (fem presenting) but I love dresses. An area of major dysphoria was being the same “gender” as Disney Princess. Tonight many “complements” that I looked like Cinderella. Thank cats I know myself & my gender so I can take it in stride… I know I look good! Still an ouch! I made dress		"Sucks that happened to you. Misgendering, even with the best intentions, is never fantastic. Real talk tho, I love your fucking energy! If we could somehow harness it, there would be world peace
You look amazing, but as the older sibling who raised a sibling in a chair with long hair, please for the love of the universe be careful and keep it off the tires, I've seen the horror that can happen.
You look amazing, and that spin was adorable!
hey maybe Cinderella was nb too
You look great! You made the dress too? That’s so cool - I’m rubbish at that kind of stuff, I just make creepy looking sock monsters at best 🤣 nothing so intricate as a dress!
this is such an awesome dress, great job!!
Dress is amazing! I love the butterfly wings on your chair! Altogether A Look!
Omg I love the wheelchair! Mine didn't have anything cool like yours
Shoes are so pretty, where did you get them?
Omg you look fantastic!! Nice work on the dress 😸
I’m getting more of a futuristic, cyberpunk vibe! I love the iridescence! Great job showing up for yourself and being you. Period. I know the struggle. I’m very anti-Disney (especially Princesses). They were what gave me a majority of my gender dysphoria growing up. I felt bad for not wanting to be like them. I preferred Lady & the Tramp and the animal movies. Maybe I was a smarter kid than I give myself credit for.
Right? They are so sweet in this. It made me smile.
I almost always keep it up in braids or ponytails I just keep it down for the dance.
Thank you!!
That’s an interesting way to look at it. It still hits me in the childhood dysphoria!
Thank you :)
It’s fun to customize! You should try it. When I added customization the # of strangers who asked “what happened to you?” “Or what’s wrong with you” etc got cut in half. Still get it but my theory is that the customization communicates that the chair is a permanent thing? I don’t know I just decorated for fun and noticed it reduced the amount of probing questions from strangers.

Had a weird gender dysphoria week being masc with a beard so I decided to do an uno reverse before I went out to watch football.		"I see that mha poster back there. We know who you were going for :D
Wow, you look great!
you look to perfect, like your hair, skin, eeye just make you look like a doll
i love the eyebrows!
Tell me why I thought you were cosplaying Uraraka form MHA. Like, perfect cosplay too.
youre very pretty and youe eyeliner is amazing!!! also the my hero poster, whos your favorite character?
Aw thanks, that's all thanks to wigs and makeup but thanks.
At this point so many people suggest it that I'm considering it.
i just know it took a lot of work to get the wig on and look right, make sure all the hair was in place, get the lashes on, do the eyeliner, and all the rest of the makeup. it takes skill so don't think its all to them.
Thank you!!!
I’d like to add.. even KNOWING it’s a wig and worked up, I can’t tell, so that’s AMAZING!  And your makeup is fabulous.
   (Should add I’m afab and never used make up so it’s a mystery to me) But…your makeup magic is so wonderful…most people fail to use makeup so naturally….

I would honestly place you in a fem space just by your face, amazing job.

Shaved my dysphoria beard!		"SUCH A GOOD FEELING. SUPPORT 💖

If you want an unsolicited tip: going through the typical cleanser / toner / moisturizer daily is not only essential to keep skin glowing, but is super helpful for minimizing shaving irritation. Cleanse > tone > shave > moisturize will open and clarify pores (and thusly hair follicles), and following with moisturizer will heal the skin from the damage of shaving and will be incredibly smooth to the touch 👽
You look great!
Omg you look so cute! <3
You look wonderful! I love your hair :)
I love it!  Beautiful face!

Wear Mask to Prevent Gender(dysphoria) (probably best for agender people)		"I'm agender and have gender dysphoria. It's doesn't bother me that much but still kinda annoying. Since I'm agender only time I'm happy with myself is when I don't have human features (I don't know if every agender is like this) so I wear a mask when I'm home alone and even sometimes when I'm going out. I thought it may help with other agender people (or any other gender that I don't know of) to have this quick tip.

&#x200B;

BTW, when I woke up I found a paper that said ""wear mask to prevent gender"" in my notes. I don't remember what I meant by that but I think this probably close enough.
bottom left is cool as shit
This is the best solution to exterminating my gender I’ve found so far
I'm agender so I feel this lol. I still want to have human features, I just wish I was able to look at them without immediately and automatically gendering them. Having gender psychologically beaten into your skull via. conditioning from society since literal birth means that I'm not sure I or anyone else will ever be able to look at me and see me in a non-gendered way.  Because every feature, every facet of clothing, seems gendered (and gendered in context to the binary). And that's kinda depressing lmao. I appreciate this though. The phrase 'wear mask to prevent gender' made me laugh and this potentially gave me tips about how to deal with dysphoria so thanks!!!
It's one of my favorites aswell but when I bought it I didn't realize it was kid sized. Now whenever I wear it, it looks like I have a tiny face."	hzdq8g	NonBinary	259	1.0	2020-07-28 12:25:00

Thank u! You’re so sweet
Thank u so much! Sometimes when I wear button ups I feel like my dysphoria is gone, specially when I’m binding!
How short? That would probably look pretty cool as well!
How it looks in the pic, my hair is actually kinda long, I just tied it to make it look short
It looks cool on the pic, so If you feel that length absolutely go with it!
I wish but I’m not allowed, maybe when I turn 18 I will
Not allowed to cut your hair?! Jeez, still cute though. Keep on rocking!

Came out to my wife today	"I came out to my wife as non-binary tonight, explaining my preferences, and dysphoria.

She said I could put my dresses in her closet, she might have a button down shirt for me, and would keep an eye out.

She asked about my work shirts, and we talked about how I adopt stuff as femme, and why they work for me.

She also offered to do a pedicure with me.

I’m a total wreck, in the best possible way. 😭💖😭💖"	"I'm so happy for you. Your wife sounds like a lovely person 😊
Good God I love to see supportive partners. My ex was NOT supportive in the slightest when I came out to her, and despite being 110% over that relationship, that part still fucks me up. Someone I loved and trusted saying the things she did... Still makes me sick to my stomach and I'm starting to cry thinking about it. Shit hurts.

Sorry to bring it down haha. I'm I'm the best place I've been in my life now, and I'm super happy for you, friend! Hold onto her tightly.
Aww! That's amazing! I recently came out to my husband as NB and he was awesome too!! Makes such a huge difference! 🥰
Wholesome af 😭
I did the same with my husband, scared the shit out of him coming home from work in floods to tears. He just hugged me and now let's me pinch any shirts that are too small!
Awwwwwww
It's so wonderful to be with those who see and accept who you are! Be you! 💙
This world needs more women like your wife! Gratz on the coming out going well friend!
My wife helps paint my nails and has lots of suggestions for skincare. Supportive partners make a world of difference and I will never be able to adequately express my gratitude. 💙
Nice! I'm so happy for you :3 that's the best thing ever. You are not alone. You've got a beautiful partner on your side. Jeep that in mind if you feel alone.

Being Nonbinary sucks. I deal with dysphoria, i'm misgendered all the time.... Nobody uses my correct pronouns.... I was feeling down, so I decided to draw myself in a way that I hope will be me in the future, what I aspire to be..... Free and Happy to be Me.		"dealing with the fibro brain fog rn so i can’t with the fancy sentences but in the immortal words of shang: you draw good

(love the shapes of your art, love the aesthetic, proportions are 👍👍👍, depth is gucci, ur killin it)
((also, i grew up in a shitty little mountain town where no one used my pronouns- i’m 25 now and everyone i’m friends with does 98% of the time (sometimes they forget but get right back to it after a reminder!) and so does most of my fam jam. that future you’re hoping for may not be as far off as you think 💛✨))

Lovely!! Now that you've conceived the image of your future self, it is the first step to materializing it :) Wish you the best in your journey!

I’m really sorry to hear that you have to deal with dysphoria and misgendering. It really does suck. Also, great job on the artwork. I am actually kinda jealous.

Do you think body fat/weight can contribute to gender dysphoria?	"This might sound stupid but I've always felt like my weight (and resulting body shape) was closely tied to my gender expression. I have very pronounced feminine curves and I'm desperately trying to lose weight to minimize those. It's more than feeling fat or out of shape. The way my body carries weight is just painfully feminine and that's not always how I want to be perceived. 

TL;DR: My weight gives away my AGAB and I hate it"	"When I was morbidly obese I felt my body shape was very feminine because of where I deposited fat (hips/ass/upper arms and huge breasts); I lost all the weight and felt great about my body in a lot of ways *but* it ended up revealing a ""desirable/perfect"" hourglass figure that was regularly remarked on with envy by cis women in my life. Ergo, I didn't find weight loss helped with gendered impressions of my body, though it helped me feel better in general.
Yes, many overweight cis men struggle with this too and you're not the only one
I feel this too, being amab, the way my weight is distributed makes it impossible for me to feel any sort of feminine or anything other than just..... Terribly male. 

I hate it, and I long to feel more androgynous. But weight loss is just...such an incredible challenge.
See I have the opposite problem where I want to lose weight so my body appears less ""obviously"" masculine. 

I think in general we as a society attach skinniness to androgyny, in a way that drives genderqueer people towards disordered eating and other unhealthy mechanisms for seeking gender euphoria. 

I know that my desire to lose weight for gender performance reasons is misguided and rooted in internalized fatphobia (and probably internalized transphobia too, honestly) but detaching myself from that type of thinking is so difficult. All I know is the answer is not to give in. I do hope to eventually lose some weight, but it won't be healthy if I do it purely through the mindset that skinniness is androgyny — because that's just not true.
[deleted]
Check out the Gender Reveal podcast if you haven't  already. They have a bunch of interesting interviews with trans people and several of those talk about weight and gender dysphoria/presentation. Also look at What We Don't Talk About When We Talk About Fat by Aubrey Gordon, a great book about existing as a fat person the the societal expectations around appearance.
I struggle with my shape, but I’m not sure it’s connected to my gender. I usually say that I don’t struggle with dysphoria, but that I do struggle with dysmorphia. Just me though.
For me it does, but I think mainly because I remember when I was much much thinner and could pull off an off the rack suit super well, and now, my hips and butt and thighs will not allow it. I miss wearing suits, and I know I could technically still wear suits, but its not the same as being able to slide on a 38R and only have a pant hem done.
Yes! I feel like this issue was what contributed to my eating disorder, despite the fact that I wouldn’t come out to myself as non-binary until years later. The positive thing is that going on cross agab hormones can effect you body fat distribution and might alleviate this. I don’t want a lot of the early changes that come with T though so I am looking to see how long the results of cool sculpting or other body contouring lasts. Also working out has helped a bunch in getting that sweet sweet gender euphoria!
Yes absolutely. I know people who will try to keep their weight below a certain amount because it makes them feel as though gaining weight will make their chest more pronounced. I can confirm that it does, gained a bunch of weight after high-school and my chest and thighs/hips got a lot bigger. Its not all bad though, while I wish my chest was smaller and I have dysphoria about it, I wear sports bras to make my chest appear smaller through my clothes and it works great. Plus, theres a ton of workouts you can do to shape your body into being more masculine (im just lazy). So while weight gain does contribute to gender dysphoria, i promise there are ways you can alleviate the dysphoria that are completely healthy.
Yes i do. 

1. Trans people are expected to look all like the ideal type of the cis woman/man. And if youre not gender confirming you are expected to look androgonoys and that has also a pushed in vision of being thin.
2. Weight can also lay down differently on biological genders, most trans people do not have the luck behind them to not have it like that. But this also lies with the truth of fatphobia of the stereotypial and sexist norms on the cis genders.
I have bad love handles and I feel it makes me look more masculine so yeah I definitely feel where the weight is being carried plays a big role in my body dysphoria. Like I wouldn’t mind so much if that weight was located in my butt or thighs.
My perception of self got worse the healthier I got cause of this. That being said I’m sure I still feel ten times better overal without the added harm of the excess weight even if I don’t see the right results.
Same.
Yes, definitely. I feel it just exaggerates the parts of me that I hate the look of anyway. On the flip side, when I was very slim people used to comment because I had a 'desirable' shape (which I hated being reminded of because it was all wrong and the thought of people looking at me and actively thinking of my agab made me feel disgust).

So I'm not sure which is worse.
I can 100% relate, it's like being overweight and self conscious of that, and being dysphoric at the same time is H E L L.

Just a bad mixture
Really wish I could donate my column shape to ppl, I'm fat but my waist and hips just blend straight together. I'm genderfluid and for the most part like to be masc but I have a good bit of femme in my wardrobe and I want hips and stuff.
I have felt dysphoric because there aren’t clothes available that are flattering and trend masc for my body shape. On special occasions, I only can wear femme wear and feel okay about how many body moves and also feel comfortable (physically not emotionally). It only stops feeling dysphoric when I put on a bunch of makeup, because then it feels like drag and it is fun for me at that point (I have recently discovered this).  Edit to say: getting dressed up is unpleasant until it’s not as a result. 

I would love a good suit but I’m broke and curvy.
Yes for sure, at least for me. When I’m thinner I have more of a stereotypical “androgynous” figure, but currently my figure is pretty feminine. What’s kinda funny and a bit upsetting for me is that I actually was thinner and had a more masculine figure about a year and a half ago and purposely gained weight to appear “more feminine” because I felt really unattractive. I felt like I needed a butt and thighs and boobs to be loved and appreciated by others. Now I am super uncomfortable with this hyper feminine figure after realizing that it’s in no way what I want :’) No longer basing my looks upon what I think others will want from me, though!
Yes, I’m (30) 6’ tall and I had been 130lbs my whole life. I unfortunately has major ptsd 5 yrs back that put me in the hospital. I was out on antidepressants and within 6 months, I went up to 200lbs. 

Fortunately, all of it went to my hips and butt and not my boobs (I’m non-binary transmasc) but my depression and dysphoria got significantly worse where I was just about nonfunctioning. Stayed that way for about 5 years. 

I finally had enough as of last Feb, started microdosing shrooms and weening myself off antidepressants. I’m now 8lbs away from having lost 50lbs (thank you Noom!) and come March, I’ll be depression and antidepressant free for a whole year! Starting T tomorrow morning and have my top surgery consult soon! 😁😁😁
I think mine does. I need to get some other issues addressed to hopefully be able to lose weight properly, I'm just praying maybe I can go back to my stick thin state I had that looked pretty andro. Now I'm a tubby hourglass with in-the-way knockers and I hate it so much. I see old photos of me and feel jealous, because if I had known my gender back then I could have rocked suits, now I cant even wear a button-up shirt.
yes
Yep. I have the same problem but with my very petite figure and bottom-heaviness. no doubt that im afab and i havent found a single piece of clothing that can hide it
I mean I could see why. Even if I’m overweight, my body doesn’t really have curves. The only thing that screams “AFAB” is MY MASSIVE BREASTS. I am 36E for those wondering, and it’s usually 50/50 on how my breasts make me feel gender dysphoria. Because some days I like the size of my boobs, and some other days I just want to chop them off.

It’s very confusing.
Yes. It's twofold. 
1. All the skinny representation and no chubby guy rep
2. Curves
Between both it's a rough go of it.
Ye
I have the stereotypical ‘dad bod’, and it definitely causes me to struggle with wishing I could present more femme/androgynous at times. *solidarity fistbump*
yes yea yeah ye and duh
The only reason it does is because I know how the world hates fat people, and fat people it perceives as women, especially. -_-
Yeah, I wish I was a bit bulkier and had more fat and muscle (mostly muscle, but some of both) than I do. Except for that on my chest. I hear women really want big tits. Does anyone want mine? ;-;
Yes it can and it’s a perfectly understandable thing to not be comfortable with =]
I think so. I used to hate my body before I realized I was non-binary (I'm AFAB) but now I'm fine with being chubby. there's so much pressure on cis women to be super skinny and beautiful and now that I realize who I am I love myself
So, I read an article lately about a trans woman who thought losing weight would make her feel better in her body. In fact, HRT gave her a female fat distribution and being a fat woman was fine, the whole issue was with being a fat man. If you are open to the idea of testosterone it changes your fat distribution to a more male distribution - think stomach, with a less pronounced waist, hips and breasts. These changes are not permanent if you choose to stop taking testosterone.
Yep. NB, AMAB. dad bod. Would MUCH rather prefer andro bod. +20lbs during pandemic has wreaked havoc on my self image.
I’m fat and afab so I kinda understand what you’re talking about. What’s helped me a lot with my image is shaving my head. I also love to wear Big T-Shirt on my more masculine days, because it helps cover up any feminine part of my body. I’ve stopped getting rid of most of my body hair (armpit hair sucks). I’ve never had body dysmorphia though so I’m not sure if these things help with that.
I don't present the way that I want to because of my weight.
I figure its kinda expected on this post anyway but CW for ED mention
Yes yes yes - i lost a lot of weight over the past yr between a breast reduction & new meds i have such a gender euphoria & it made my ed come back a lot worse because im scared to put back on weight and have more defined curves/fat distribution :/
Also strongly agree to the misguided ""assigning androgyny to skinny"" and it has definitely been hard to shake that mindset
yes. yes i absolutely do. i have been crying about it a lot lately lmao 🙃
I think so, yes! As an AMAB enby, I definitely feel a lot less dysphoria after I lost weight, much of this was muscle. I was looking pretty sturdy/muscular with a big-ish stomach, which made me feel very ""manly"". I had to lose weight for health reasons and being (almost) slender has helped me so much, since now I see in the mirror what it feels like on the inside. (But as others have commented very eloquently before, this whole link of skinniness to androgyny is very harmful.)
I feel this in my soul. It's really really difficult for me.
Even when I lost all the weight and became 6 to 10% body fat, all fat was still in upper arms and thighs (feminine areas) as I was still crying.

Upper arm fat is caused by estrogen.

So yeah I believe it does.
I already have a pretty flat chest thankfully... but these hips keep telling on me 💀
>I think in general we as a society attach skinniness to androgyny, in a way that drives genderqueer people towards disordered eating and other unhealthy mechanisms for seeking gender euphoria. 

You hit the nail right in the head.
Mmhm, with you there. Even a little weight around my tummy feels pretty bad. Doesn't help that there's not usually a lot of talk about disordered eating in AMAB people.
Second paragraph should be framed cuz omg yes
Same with the hair loss concern... 😢
Not trying to overstep but have you looked into spironolactone? That can slow/stop male pattern baldness that T can cause.
i actually expressed the same concern abt hair loss to my endocrinologist, and she said that once i reach the age where my hair may start to thin, there are a few medications i could take to prevent that from happening! idk what country you're in so we both probably have very different options, but i'm sure with a bit of research you'll be able to find some anti-balding meds before going on T :)
Thanks! I'm always looking for new podcasts and books!
This is so real. And I’m technically gender fluid and trend femme but I feel like that is only because of the availability of styles for this body I’m in.
When I was at my skinniest I loved the androgynous look but now I am too fat too pull it off
Same...small chest, really wide pelvis which gives me, what my husband has described as ""pixar mum butt."" 😑

My weight has kinda yoyo'd over the last decade cos of medication. Went from slightly underweight to obese and now back to a technically ""healthy"" weight, but the stretch marks and flappy skin, alongside the residual weight around the hips has caused major dysphoria.

people with periods: alternate names for it??	"Does anyone use other names for their period?

I (AFAB) use birth control without placebos but still occasionally get a period. I'm someone who experiences extreme dysphoria due to this and have just started one, unfortunately.

For me, calling it what it is can feel really bad - makes me feel very typically feminine. Because of this, I like to use other names for it - some that don't even relate at all.

Anyone else do this??"	"I prefer to call it ""cycle"". Like ""I'm on my monthly cycle""I just don't like the word ""period"".
I call it the blood moons.
The subscription no one signs up for! 😞
you’re just manstruating bro
Werewolf week 🥲

Especially makes sense for me now post-hysto where it's just a bit of achiness and moodiness.
Shark Week

The Wolf Moon 

Time of the Red Elk

Evil Tide
""one of my chronic illnesses is flaring up""
The Bloodbath.
While I still menstruated I called it Hell, or shark week, or bloody mess.
My friend always texts me ""The Blood Moon has risen!"" And that means she wants her favorite ice cream
Mostly because I get real whiny and miserable- my darling wife would call me annoying. So now we just refer to it as ""an Annoyance"" or ""No fun"" and I may say ""I'm kind of annoying rn"" or ""I'm alot of no fun this week""- towards the end of it I may follow up with ""I'm working it out."" It's a pretty nice excuse for others, too- no one wants to hang out while you are so annoying you become self-aware.

It's nice because we can be frank without everyone knowing what we are on about. ""Annoying""-or any derivitive- is not a word we use otherwise.

I suggest anyone who has a significant other come up with your own dictionary so they know what you are saying and feeling in real time with letting on to people in as they may be offended.
I call it Dave ""dammit Dave's back"" or ""wow Dave's late this month""
I just think of it as bleeding, I generally don’t have to refer to it with other people.
Shark week
I don’t generally talk about it with other people - but in my own head i have a few different names for it:

• you-know-what

• suffering

• week of suffering

• hell week
the family curse
My alternative name for it is 'OH FOR FUCKS SAKE, AGAIN? DIDNT WE JUST DO THIS?'
I tend to be fatalistic. When it starts I tell my husband ""my time has come"".

Otherwise I tend not to mention it much. It's just kind of relevant to his interests so he's the only one I tell.

Though to the outside world, I use the common terms for clarity. Like if I'm giving a kid advice on reddit or talking to my doctor. But I do prefer words like ""cycle"" in that instance. Though in the kid example, I try to use whatever word they seem to be using because I don't want to confuse them.
Ok I know this is kinda unrelated but a big thing that has helped me with menstruation related dysphoria has been using a cup rather than pads/tampons as it greatly reduces the number of times a day I need to deal with it if that makes any sense
my mom calls it ""war"" cause of, well, blood. and it hurts!

though it's for a different reason, because we live in a culture that traditionally teaches not to talk about periods (it's gradually changing fortunately)
We cal it “shark week” at my house. Because there’s blood in the water and someone’s liable to get their head bitten off if we ain’t careful. 

(Obligatory note that sharks are actually very sweet and much more in danger from us than we are from them. I still love how metal the name feels.)
i always quite like “falling to the communists”
i refer to mine as ""The Bleed"" and when i had to not take my birth control on every three month thing where you have to wait a week ""Forced Bleeds"".

I thankfully don't have to do Forced Bleeds anymore :3
My partner and i always just say “im bleeding rn” or whatever
I just call it my ""sick week"".
Monthly blood sacrifical ritual to appease the underwordly gods.
I just tell someone I'm bleeding, personally. Yea it's a little sadistic but it's funny as fuck to see people's reactions when you're like: ""OH yeah hi Trisha just wanted to tell you I'm *fucking bleeding*""
Offering time - this came about because I get sick and chocolate somehow stops the nausea. So since I made jokes in an ill mood ""unless you have offerings for the avocado god, go away."" people around me now call it my offerings time and do bring me offerings of chocolate and other things.

demon summoning time - my mom said I always appeared demonic during it.

cycle - often heard medically

Evil ninja time/the evil ninja/my ninja - this is due to my describing my cramps as a ninja whom is stalking me and picking random times to stab me. Everyone around me now calls their periods Their ninjas.

vampire time - honestly my one friend's boyfriend thought that periods were just blood and would be perfect for donating to blood or to people whom thought they were vampires. poor dude got disturbed by reality. But she now calls her period her vampire time to upset him.

Blah stage - my mom calls her's the blah stage because she just feels blah

Balloon time/bloated days - my sister calls her this because nothing fits, she bloats and that is what she uses to name it.

Murder week/serial killer week - a friend of mine loves serial killers and has a way heavy flow. so she makes jokes about it looking like murder or a serial killer is in her pants. Plus sometimes she says she feels murdery during hers. We make sure she has lots of her feel good stuff.

Bloody baron- I know some girls in school that called it that

some peeps I know named theirs like Jason, mike myers and such. They also had period parties.

What I found out is you can pretty much call your period anything that relates to your feelings to the period and it is socially acceptable.
“Shedding the blood of my enemies”
""I'm not feeling well."" Simple, gets the point across. If they ask what's wrong, say you have a stomach ache... might even be true! Nobody has to know that stomach ache is actually cramps.
While I don't have dysphoria surrounding my period, I usually say I'm hemorrhaging or I have the bloods (rhymes with foods). I also call my menstrual cup my Blood Chalice. >:)
I simply call it ""I am bleeding"" - although I did not have to do it since over a year, thanks to my understanding doctor and some medicine. Made me dysphoric as heck too. All the best wishes to you!
I call it shedding.
I call it shark week or the lunar curse. Makes me feel way more metal about it and fits with the faerie theme the gender has going.
Shark Week (ex. it's shark week, ugh)

The Blood Curse (ex. the blood curse is upon me, y'all)
i usually just say i’m ‘on’ :) or say like, i came on a couple days ago etc. not mentioning it by name kinda helps
I usually just tell people ""I'm bleeding"" :p

If they are confused and/or concerned, I specify that I'm bleeding from my uterus.
I’m cis AFAB but if I don’t feel like declaring my period to the world then I just tell people I’m sick. My abdomen is bloated, I’m in pain, I have a headache, I want to eat everything, my face is breaking out, I have to poop, I’m hemorrhaging blood. I’m 110% sure this qualifies. I’m sick.

I do know someone who calls it Shark Week 😂
My monthly misgendering
Mine thankfully stopped on T almost instantly. But I honestly just called it my cycle or blood week. I don't miss it.
Blood moon!

“The Blood Moon riseth this week.”

“The Blood Moon has descended, as I may now do.” 


That’s my current go to
Amab but shark week was always my favourite
The moon blood is upon us
I call mine the crime scene
My aunt always called it Herman and would say things like ""oh, is Herman visiting?""  I still to this day don't know why. 

A lot of folks also refer to it as Shark Week.
Satans waterfall 


The concert of blood


Murder week
My cis female friend and I have been calling it demon shark week since before I even came out
I prefer 'hormone cycle' to 'menstrual cycle' personally
The bloodshed.

I don't have it myself, but i was inspired by [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXRxRTW6nXg)
'Anarchy Week' as my uterus is rebelling for me not fertilising it.
'Shark Week'
'Aunt Flow is visiting'
'Carrie'
'The Red Wedding'
I can't deal with things that mention/ imply blood or bleeding which is why I never liked things like The Red Tide or Shark Week. 

I refer to it as Bald Pineapple. A bizzare little code that could mean nothing else but also doesn't make me feel bad by mentioning blood.
I call it the ''Virginia falls'' or ''lingon berry''
I call it the violent mosh pit in my uterus. Or violent mosh pit in my tummy. Depends who I'm talking to haha
I called it shark week when I used to have them!
i call it suffering
I call it the Spanish Inquisition because it’s unexpected and bloody.
My moon cycle
[full stop](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_stop)
Manstration if you don’t get that I’m sorry-
I use the phrase ""blood moon""
Names aren't too bad for me, but I've heard ""shark week"" etc. I think I just tend to call it ""blood time"" to myself. Blood happens sometimes. Everyone can bleed and will bleed sometimes. 

As an aside, a menstrual cup has been very helpful for me. Once in place it can be left for 12 hours. I can forget for those hours, which is nice. Finding the right fit can take some time, but it's been absolutely worth it for me.
As others mentioned, I just call it my cycle and it’s the easiest way to get my point across without making me feel too dysphoric.

But hey, look at it this way!

#Some men have a cycle, too!

Some trans men may still experience a cycle and it does not make them any less of a man. Some of us nonbinary folks may experience a cycle and it doesn’t change anything about our gender identity! I’m also afab and have always had massive bobs, I’ve considered top surgery or maybe just a reduction bc of dysphoria, but ultimately I felt I would miss them if I changed. So I’ve come to accept them and choose a style of shirt each day that matches my mood - whether they’re practically invisible in an oversized hoodie or nearly bustin out of a tank top lol it took a longer time for me to accept that than my cycle tbh and but both are a natural part of our bodies and we can still love ourselves and our bodies even if parts of them are proverbially vestigial for us as we no longer identify as the sex we were assigned at birth.
Aunt flow, no one will know what you mean.
My sister and I do “Japan is invading” in reference to the Japanese flag lol and “the monthly subscription to Satan’s waterfall”
When I have my random/sporadic spotting with my IUD, I just tell my partner I'm bleeding or that I'm having a bit of a hormonal time.
Idk fam i just avoid ever talking about it. I kinds think of it as hell week or just discomfort days
I call mine “hell week”
Icky times does it for me
I call it moon sickness. Pretty sure it came from a meme about off brand tampons. Makes me feel witchy when I say it.
i like to call mine shark week or the monthly bloodbath
I say that “Moses Has Parted the Red Sea” or that I’m “On the Rag”.
Gilman
Could just call it what the medical community does. Menstruation or uterine discharge
Me & my bestie call it shark week 🦈
There are a lot of fun things you could use for code words.  Don't let your imagination fall short!
The red scare
shark week
My body is being a slaughter house
i call it The Blood Festival
I call it ""shark week"" as a joke sometimes
bloodshed
Usually just “menstruation” for me feels okay
I call it shark week, cause the shape of the uterus and ovaries look similar to a sharks brain.
Everyone I know just calls it ‘bleeding’
“It’s that time of the month again” is how I refer to it.
Shark Week
My mum called it shark, because if you go in the water a shark will get you 🤣.
my partner and i call it sharks
'Elizabeth Bathory is visiting again.'
My bf and I say shark week
just give it a random name. 

""Hey guys, \[enter name here\] is back...

may confuse those who dont know what you named it but anyway...
Have a bout of The shining elevator
I call it Satan's sacrificial waterfall lol
i've called it 'the week of reckoning' before :p
Blood moon
The Bloodening
Shark week
i wouldnt actually advise this but when i was 11 i had a friend who called it ""Satan's Waterfall""
I just call it that time of the month or that thing that happens.
The devil and or blood moon
I call it “satans waterfall” and my friend calls it “riding the red dragon”

EDIT: there’s also an old British term “I’ve got the painters in”
I call it Gozer, ""Gozer has arrived"". Hear me out...

Years ago there was a rage comic where the uterus was like 🌷🥰🌈 ""hey just to let you know I've made a nice warm home for you to make a baby!"" and the person said ""it's ok I'm not having a baby"", and the uterus got very angry and was like 🤬🔥💥🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸🩸 . And it reminded me of the part in Ghostbusters 1 where Gozer is being chill until they ask

Gozer: ""Are you a god?""

Ray Ghostbuster: ""...No""

Gozer: ""Then, DIIIEEEE!""

[Link for the uninitiated](https://youtu.be/vb5-LLQ3FjY)

And so ever since seeing that comic I perceive my uterus to be saying ""You're not having a baby? Then DIIIEE"".

Also for bonus - my partner once emailed to ask how I was because I'd mentioned I was irritable due to PMS and it went:

""Hey honeykins how are you feeling?""

""There is no honeykins there is only Zuul"". 

😁
I use moon sickness cause yes
The curse
i just call it dysphoria week
Shark week
Shark week, Red tide, Bloodstock
Shark week
Shark week
I just tell my partner I’m bleeding and she gets the idea, but because I have endometriosis I often have to discuss with professionals and feel icky about it. Also hate that I have to go to the womens center to be seen on this crap.

So I feel for you, but sometimes unfortunately there’s not a lot you can do
I straight up say I'm bleeding cus I like making people uncomfortable ""Ugh I'm bleeding and i just realised I stained my pants"" sounds concerning but my bf and best friend have caught on lol
Shark week or riding the red wave were my go tos
the word doesnt bother me, but it does bother my (trans) son, so we started calling it ""warrior time"" which is kinda silly but it worked.
Satans waterfall. That’s what my new AFAB friend calls it and the rest of us have adopted it. You could also say “my body is betraying me rn” lol
I just say “I’m dying”
The communists are storming Petrograd
i call it shark week or warrior week lol
The curse
I call it shark week lol
Me and my sibling call it “Molting” like spiders do, lol. We both really like spiders, so that’s probably why.
i call it my bloodmoon
I say that the red banner dropped.
I had friends who would say they were attacked by the red ninja. I just say my body is trying to kill me again.
I go with “bleeding to death”
I just say period. I actually get more dysphoric from nicknames since most sound more feminine (Aunt Flo for example) or feel more like some kind of secret girl code that non girls shouldn't know (basically every other word). 

Period is a common name for it that everyone knows, so it doesn't feel wrong for me to say it. Im also somewhat open about that kinda thing anyway, and it actually really bothers me for some reason when cis girls use nicknames to hide them being on their period, so part of my language comes from that.
Shark week or reverse vampire week?
my mom and i used to call it our moonflow
Blood moon, definitely, and sometimes red moon.
Also the ever typical ""Aunt Flo visiting""
Moon cycle
Red Wedding
i really love “Shark Week”. in the past i have also used “Female Fun Time” but it doesn’t feel as fitting anymore
I tend towards either calling it ""shark week"" or ""the blood space wars."" As in ""the armistice has one again broken the long peace, and the blood space wars have resumed."" 

I used to call it my monthly, but I guess I tend more towards the dramatic.
I call it Aunt Flo. Most other things I could call it make me feel uncomfortable. 😅😅
I call it “pits of hell” 
Ex: “yeah im in pits of hell again” 
/hj
My Flow
yall don't call it satans sacrificial waterfall?
Shark week. Or I've seen someone use the code with their dad ""Japan is invading and the troops need supplies"" for ""I'm on my period and need tampons"" because Japan's flag is white with a red circle in the center. Always thought that one is funny
monthly subscription to Lucifer's waterfall :) and that sucks I'm on mine too :( the cramps are the worst part
I don't get my period anymore either but I used to just say I'm bleeding
I once described it as "" my aunt Flo is visiting for the week.""
Personally I just go with “I’m bleeding”
Shark week.
Cyclists
Me and my girlfriend made up this code if either of us gets it in public, 'red slushie'. 

Cause it's a bloody red mess, and I feel like my insides are being made into a slushie!
I’ve heard some people include the moon in their description in movies and shows. I thought it’s pretty cool but I’m pagan with a moon affinity.
In middle and high school, my friends and I called them Uncle Charlie so we could talk about them in public.
my best friend calls it “satan’s waterfall”. i simply just say “i’m bleeding”. it could mean anything, it could be a healing scab that opened or a blister anywhere on your body.
I say ""Cycle."" I also have extreme dysphoria when having a cycle, so have also been on low dose BC for many years to keep from having a cycle at all and also because the endometriosis was so bad and the pill was the only thing that helped. My MD cautioned me last year, however, that being on BC for a long as I had - roughly 15 years, could increase my chance of stroke or heart attack. And a person in my office younger than me shared she had a heart attack 2 years ago because of BC, so that hit close to home.

We discussed the options and I've always wanted a hysterectomy but I've seen too many patients with adverse outcomes, and I'm not medically transitioning, so keeping my ovaries for hormonal balance was best for me, so I opted to try a uterine ablation first. There's a 70% chance of never having a cycle again, plus it burns out the lining of the uterus so there goes the endometriosis! Those are odds I can live with! I had the procedure in April and I have had amazing results so far: very little cramping and zero cycles yet! I highly recommend the ablation if folks are sure they don't want to procreate and they don't want the full on hysterectomy.
Question marks
Shark week.
-Aunt Flow is visiting

-The curse

-Mother Nature

I use mother nature alot. And Aunt Flow if I want someone to curse at. ""Aunt Flow is a bitch!""

Edit: formatting
I say the ick. 
Like ick I hate it. Ick blood. And when people as why you're feeling weird they don't really push too hard when you say idk I got a bit of the ick I guess.
I call it “breeding season” or “mating cycle” because it sounds funny and i’m a petpiller
i have many i call it, some funny some serious, if you want serious i do monthly, or cycle, if you want funny i say satans waterfall
I stole “bodily blood sacrifices” from a friend and I use it permanently now
My college roommates would say ""The communists are in the funhouse.""
Me and my other trans friend call it shark week
me and my friends call it ""Satan's waterfall"" or ""monthly subscription"".. or sometimes both at once pft
I call it my moon. It embraces my indigenous roots and witchy vibe.
I just say like ""I'm a shark boy""
satans waterfall
I refer to mine as ""Shark Week"".
I call it sharkweek
I like to call it Satans Waterfall
“shark week” 
“crimson riot”
“red ribbon week”
Shark week was my gfs fav term :)
I normally try to think of it as my grumpy neighbor redecorating.
i'm AFAB too but i get dysphoric about my periods too, i wish i didnt have any at all, but that doesnt work on a afab body. but i got no names for it sadly, if i did, i'd use them for mine, but i dont so yea :< but hey we're still changing, well im not but idk about you, you might be still changing. i also recommand someone who is very good with names that goes with stuff, i have someone, and theyre amazing with names. but i never thought of asking someone this until now, if you have someone who you came out to and supports you 100% like i do, then i recommand them for names.
Underwear massacre🩲🩸
My fiancé calls it my “oil change”, “the forbidden marinara”, and “cursed wine”
- Shark week

- Satan’s waterfall

- Shitty month time

- The month thing

- “It”

Are all ones I’ve used and seen used
Oh yeah, I get that. Personally I just don't like anything that could show it as what it is and ""out"" me as a biological female.
ive said this since it started. i hate blood and period just makes me think of blood 😭 cycle makes me think of the cramps and stuff, so it's less icky for me.
Close to this, I just say ""my time"" short for time of the month
""Link! The blood moon rises once again. Be careful!""
That's pretty epic lol, might steal that one (if that's ok :)
Damn you just made me want one even more now (I'm mtf). I'm missing out on both blood moons and being bred by vampires.
Dudeeeee sameeeee :]
oo that sounds pretty mystical :0 ✨
I find it funny how mostly everyone except trans fems hate periods 😆
facts.
totally gonna steal this, thanks
That's so good.
This so perfect
I’m always so confused for a few days when I would normally be having my cycle after my hysto. Like, why am I so sad but horny at the same time? Why do I only want fried food and sugar? Why does that cute happy family make me angry? And then why do I feel so much better all of a sudden!? Oh, that would have been my first bloody day! I get it now!
Evil tide I’m cackling 😂
Came here to say Shark Week
Love it
That's lovely, very concise and understandable without being evident.
Dave, so random, love it
i refer to it as ‘The Bleeding’ lmao
Shark week is my go to. But if you don’t want it to be recognizable as a period, try acting super harrowed and saying“I am wrestling with a demon this week”. Answer no further questions.
Lol an old sex ed video called it the curse too
Fatalistic!! That's fantastically hilarious. Love it
That's quite interesting though unfortunate. Very glad progress is being made in that aspect though!
I’ve heard that there’s a (danish?) expression that goes “there are communists in the funhouse”
Why’d you have to wait a week every three months?I just take mine and don’t skip any I thought everyone did that?
I also say “I’m bleeding” because it’s sounds quite dramatic which fits the bill.
Amazing.
Lmaooo
I love this answer. Bloody Baron & Vampire Time might be my favorites
Accurate findings, very cool.
Blood Chalice, that's great!
Oooh. I like that.
Love the metal And faerie theme, very epic!
This was common in our family
Simple and accurate, I like it
Niiice
Herman!! I love that, lol.
Nice. Love the inspiration
Interesting, I understand that. Bald Pineapple - very random, bizarre, love it!!
Oooh lingonberry is neat!
Also if your BC that you're on currently isn't working out, I reccomend Desogestrel if your doctor would think that would work it! It usually stops or reduces periods greatly. I went from heavy paralysing ones to having none and I haven't had one in over a year. It's that good my mum even went on it 🤣 I don't have side effects either which is nice! I get the odd cramp every now and then but nothing compared to what I used to have. 

Of course I'm not a doctor and I can only reccomend based on my own personal experiences so you'd have to mention different options with your own doctor and of course you may not even want to try that but I thought I'd suggest it anyway.
Amazing. Lol.
Love this
Nice one.

I’VE SEEN ENOUGH OF DEATH AND PAIN
Did not know that. Interesting
Never heard of her so looked her up- how- interesting!!
oh i just say to my friends ""Pain"" or ""cramps"" and they know what i mean.
That's a really interesting viewpoint. You're right about period being universally known - it's cool you're comfortable with that.
Injections, could explain any mood shift/cramps. You gotta get monthly injections for some reason
I say ""I'm on"" but that's probably still too out-y
I came here for this. Thank you. 😁
Of course!
LMAO bred by vampires 🤣 a sentence i never thought id read.
Does that mean people are giving their period away? I'll buy for $50. Don't care if it comes out of my girl dick I'm sure it's healthy.
Oldie and a goodie
I have my clue app reminder set to ""beware of sharks""
Please use it if you like
Im not really sure? I think they assumed i was going to do it for medical reasons like just birthcontrol and not like for gender dysphoria as well. They set me up originally for painful periods but once they noticed i was trans they said

""Okay im gonna see if we can get you on just a continuous dose""

and bam! no more Forced Bleeds!
Thanks for the advice!! Will look into it.
Soooo many people would give it to you for free in a heartbeat even cis women lmao
HAVE MINE FOR FREE. I FEEL LIKE THE SLIM JIM MAN IS GOUGING OUT MY INSIDES RN

I really can't explain it, but having blue hair gave me dysphoria for some reason?? All I know is that I feel 10000% more like myself now that I'm back to purple. First selfies I haven't hated in a long time. :)		"I dislike the blue hair on myself too. I feel better with green and purple (and the pink-ish when it fades)
Heeey - I know the feeling - I love dying my hair, but ONLY red. It's weird.
Society often connects the colour blue and the male gender.


Society
This is so damn wholesome! It's awesome to see you seem so happy in these photos 😁💜
Ain't gender weird? And ain't you gorgeous :D :D
Nice hair, sweet piercings, and nice pronouns cause I'm bias asf. All in all, 15/10. Here, have a snail 🐌
Love the purple...beautiful! It goes great with the colour of your top as well!
Im so happy for you! You look amazing
You look absolutely fabulous, I need purple hair again.
love it 💜
That’s how I feel having hair that’s light at all no matter the color, even if they look good aesthetically they make me feel like shit. You look great!
Purple lyf 😜
My friend is the same haha. They say they’re a red head at heart. They just feel like they’re supposed to have red hair.
Honestly I think it might have been that, at least partially. It did feel too masculine in a way."	smvaje	NonBinary	230	0.99	2022-02-07 17:12:03

When you realise you feel much more comfortable as an Enby and it takes away a lot of dysphoria you were feeling about being a guy or girl		"I love the sentiment unfortunately being called 'cute' makes me cringe
I love the fact that Doki Doki Literature Club has become the meme language of the trans community.
This 💜
No one ever called me cute in my entire life, I guess I have to accept the fact that I'm not attractive 😗
I've always wanted to be a handsome man and a beautiful woman

Oh, hey.  Look at what you added to the thread.

Dysphoria begone ☀️ (for the three seconds of taking this photo but it’s a start :) being nb and naturally curvy is not easy		"A note on curves: I don’t know if this will help you feel better at all, but my cis male brother is a personal trainer and gym rat and his butt/thighs are so curvy that he can never find men’s pants that fit. So there’s a real manly AMAB with curves out there. 

Also, he’s been looking at ordering pants from this company, Barbell Apparel, because they make men’s pants for people with curvy butts/thighs. I’m a curvy enby and I’ve also been considering ordering some men’s pants from them, because they may actually fit me but will be more of a men’s style. 

Sorry for my rambling. You look great to me.
From one lover of dress shirts to another, you have a splendid look going.
I feel you so bloody much.

I use big masculine clothes due to having a lot of curves.

It still doesn't help fully.
I wish I had natural curves :(
I’m sorry. But just for the record. There is no enby body type, there is no right way to be enby, we all deserve to have the body we are most comfortable with. And I know there are plenty of non-binary people who wish they were more curvy, me included. But that doesn’t make you any less valid.
I’m sorry, I hope your dysphoria begones
amab enby born with similar issues (tho not as extreme) and i can attest to the difficulty of more fitted things like jeans the only things i find consistently fit are loose fit carpenter jeans
I’m a runner, amab and  I was told to look for men’s “athletic fit” jeans.  I was getting pretty frustrated during peak skinny jeans.  It was hard to find anything that fit  my thighs, even relaxed fit seemed less relaxed then.  
The athletic fit I own are more along the line of skinny jeans but actually fit my body shape.  Typically stretch denim and not baggy. I think they’re supposed to show off athletic legs which may in the end look more feminine.
I know American Eagle sells them.
Don’t be sorry, thank you! This is very helpful to read :)
Im AFAB enby and whenever I feel frustrated about having curves, I just remember that my cis boyfriend is super curvy, like he legit has a bubble butt and big hips and thighs and small waist. We are even the same pants size. It makes me feel better
I 🤍them!
Thank you! I understand there is no enby body type, but it’s also something that everyone experiences differently. For me personally, much of my dysphoria is related to my curves.
Fair. I hope you are able to mask or deal with it in a way you feel is best and most healthy. and feel confident that you look great!"	i1urt5	NonBinary	215	1.0	2020-08-01 16:15:48
don’t know if this belongs here, but here’s some late night dysphoria art for yall (tw, maybe??)		"nine days out of ten i am content with my body but every once in a while the planets align! and they tell me to cut my tits off! here’s coping!!
I think it does. It speaks to your experiences navigating the relationship between in internal and external. Which I thing is really relatable on this sub.

A bit personal but how do you feel during and right after make your art? And how does it feel looking back at old artworks like this?
[deleted]
This is a stunning drawing. There needs to be so much room for our experience in the art world! I love that you are putting this out there. Thank you.
I feel this in my soul. 

Do you have an art account on Instagram or something? I’d like to follow your art 
the is haunting i love it
Wow I love this. I really love your work, like, I would hang it on my wall. Where do you sell your art?
This is so incredible.

This isn't how my own Dysphoria is at all but looking at this, I can *feel* it
I feel this on a spiritual level
thank you so much, i appreciate it!

how i feel during is a mixed bag; this page was after three or four days of mounting frustration so it was cathartic. this is a style i tend to go to when i need to take my mind off of the present because it’s a lot of long lines that flow into each other, if that makes sense? it’s just... soothing to me haha. 

i usually feel a lot better after i finish something like this. it’s like turning the pressure valve just a little bit, and having a physical *result* of all my angst makes it feel a lot more productive than just stewing in it. 

looking back is a mixed bag too; i don’t see any sort of therapist so sketchbooks are how i process emotionally and track my mental health. this is a page i think i’ll still enjoy in a couple months, but there have *definitely* been pages that make me cringe lmao.

thank you so much for the questions! my sketchbooks are like my external heart and i’m always happy to talk about them
Seconding this! i'd love to see more of your work!
i just [made one!](instagram.com/st.inkstains) 

my style shifts drastically so it’s not all this kind of work but hey come on through! also thank you so much!
[deleted]
Yeah I see how long flowly lines can be cathartic. Turning that emotion energy and transferring that into something theough a phyical process must feelg draining in a good way. And a pressure release.

I guess those piece are really good markers of where you were. And after some distance from those moments you can reflect in and unpack those emotions in a saver way, even if they are sometimes cringe worthy lol.

Thanks for sharing, it seem like you've figured out a good coping mechanism for yourself. 
Just followed!! 😄 

That's okay so does mine 😊

You're killing it!! *hugs* 💙💜
Sorry to hear that, I know the feeling. You look great.
You're beautiful.

Transphobia is shitty, and this was poor timing. Don't write toxic poetry when you're piss poor at rhyming.
And you need a ghostwriter.

bf refuses to see me as nonbinary	"for context i met him and immediately told him i was trans before we really got close. i viewed him as very educated and accepting of trans people and didn’t think too hard about it. then i heard him comment on someone else that he doesn’t get why people choose to go by they/them pronouns. meanwhile im using he/they 🤕

well lately i’ve been experimenting more with dressing both feminine one day and masculine another now that im out of my family home. he rages on and on about how “its hot” that i “can do both” not to mention that im post op and hes been saying things like he wouldn’t know what to do with himself if i still had tits or was a girl, even had a moment where he cupped my flat chest and said “im squeezing your boobs” which gave me an insane amount of dysphoria and he immediately knew he was wrong and said everybody has boobs. ok i guess…. he sees no harm in saying that kind of stuff because he says “you’re still a man to me you’re my boyfriend” 

i don’t know how to get him to acknowledge that im not a trans man or trying to detransition or anything. im simply genderfluid and prefer not being called a man or a woman. i say im not either on a daily basis now…

EDIT: i think i definitely should have mentioned that we live together (otherwise i would be homeless) and have been dating for a few months. if we didn’t live together i would have definitely broken up with him."	"Time to refuse to see him as a boyfriend

Super inappropriate to make up boobs that aren't there(even if they were) knowing you have chest dysphoria. Also raging about they/them pronouns and nonbinary identity while dating someone who uses  that pronoun set in part and is nonbinary is so gross. 

You deserve better than a  man trying to convince himself and you that he respects your gender. You deserve better than a partner who refuses to appreciate you as yourself
I think this person is frankly toxic as hell.

It's rather clear he doesn't respect you at all, not even doing you the decency of using your correct pronouns. And honestly! Anyone who'd not see any harm in triggering dysphoria for me would be out of my life faster than they can say 'I am sorry'. Especially if that has been done on multiple occasions with no apologies at all for this horrible behavior!

I'd try and have a very serious talk about all of this with him, and if it doesn't work out, leave him. You deserve someone who will respect you for who you are.
honestly? there are better and cooler people in the world. try talking it out if you really like this guy, but consider breaking it off.
to me this is pretty basic, if someone doesn't get my being nonbinary it's a deal breaker for me.

like another commenter said how positive is this relationship overall? if the dude doesn't respond well to a Serious Talk and there's not enough benefit in other areas I'd end it

I'm really sorry you're going through this at all.
I ask this a lot;

&#x200B;

What GOOD are you getting out of this? This man sounds toxic, this man has presumed/assumed he has some pass he does not have. He is disrespecting your most basic human rights, totally. 

&#x200B;

This is abusive as hell.

&#x200B;

The answer to teach him is; Dump his ass.
I know hearing “just break up” might seem dismissive if you’re looking for advice on how to make something work. But when you start to find your power and learn how to stand in it, you’ll give less of it away to people who don’t deserve you. Let someone else educate his toxic ass. You are too valuable to waste any part of your life on someone who doesn’t see you. 

Take this from a twice-divorced enby who is being seen by my new partner, and being seen for the first time in my life. I wish I hadn’t wasted so much time trying to make pieces fit that didn’t belong. Being truly seen, is effortless and natural. And there are people who can see you, even if you haven’t met them yet.
That's hard 😞 the best thing is talking. Tell him it hurts that he does that because he won't know otherwise. 

Hope you get that sorted out, it sounds like the sort of thing that would niggle away over time and eat you inside. Tell him every time he does something like that too, not just now and then. Positive reinforcement.

Sending you love my dude! 💕
I'm sorry you're going through this. In my experience, one of the hardest parts about being gender fluid is dating and finding people who can love and accept you for who you are. For your sake, I hope he will eventually unlearn some of these things and treat you the way you deserve to be treated.
If you are with him because you need housing, this goes beyond normal problems. This kind of situation is an unbalanced power dynamic where you might feel inclined to let things pass because otherwise you would be homeless. 

As someone who was in a situation where they were relying on their boyfriend for housing and the situation slowly turned abusive, I'd really recommend looking into back up plans for housing. 

Ask your friends if they could help you if you really need it. Take a look at the shelters nearby, they often offer extra services and case workers to help when they can. 

Also know that if you aren't on a lease and live with your boyfriend, you probably are legally homeless/couch surfing. This can sometimes qualify you for more assistance.

Even if you think things will turn out fine with your boyfriend it never hurts to have some backups ready just in case.

I've had some experience couch surfing and being homeless, so DM me if you'd like.
He sounds toxic. He's using your gender expression as a fetish. I'd start looking for a new place, and get him out of your life if he doesn't have the bare minimum of respect for you.
So many people have trouble accepting that we exist. I think it can often take time to truly understand. This doesn't sound pleasant for you though and relationships should bring you closer to who you want to be, not further. I have had a similar issue with my significant other. We were together before I came out, but she was willing to accept it until it had to affect her behavior (like using my pronouns and no longer calling me a girl - even in bed). This was extremely difficult for both of us. She has also had trouble understanding my demi-sexual identity and still sometimes thinks of it as me being a lesbian, which I don't feel applies at all. We've had some difficult conversations, but with the effort and attention she pays now, everything is great. She really understands my identity now and tries to do things that support me even when using my pronouns is awkward in front of people who won't. She's great. I hope you get the same results from having some tough convos. If he doesn't treat you as if you're the identity you identify with after that, I'd think about what you're comfortable accepting in a romantic relationship. I still think a lot of people need a lot of reinforcement that we really do feel outside of male or female.
You said that your out to your family, right? Couldn’t you break up with him and move in with one of your family members who is accepting? I’m not sure what else you could do, sorry, but I’m here for you
You need to break up. Living together though can be tricky. Don’t know your exact living situation, but you need to start making plans to leave NOW. Once you have a safe place secured and your stuff moved, leave him. If the only reason you can justify staying with him is your living situation, then obviously you don’t want to be with him in the first place.
DUMP HIM
I cis(f) am dating a nb person and I would never repeatedly do something that would cause them any dysphoria. On the flip side ive been helping them affirm their appearance by letting them dabble into my makeup/nail polish/clothes/etc.

Your bf should feel bad and guilty for what they've said and done to you and if they don't then its time to let him go.
Fuck him
Definitely start trying to find another place to live, and definitely break up with him when you do. Until then, maybe send him some short educational YouTube videos or TikToks? You might feel better because you're actively doing something improve your situation, even if it doesn't get you a different outcome.
Fam, find your own place and leave his ass. That’s one of the reasons I ended my engagement back in 2021. The other one being my SO was refusing to accept/acknowledge me as asexual because I had sex w/him during the relationship.

Find yourself a place and leave. His. Ass.
Bestie please don't view this man as your boyfriend let alone friend. I know you're in a not great situation, but you eet to start an EXIT plan the same way abuse survivors do it. 

He's at minimum fetishizing you for what you are and aren't.
Talk about it
If he starts taking you seriously and actually starts respecting your boundaries then you're golden
If he doesn't then say something along the lines of ""if you arent going to respect me for who I am the you simply will not be a part of my life"" obviously find a better way to say that but you get the gist
Listen, you didn't say how long you were dating this dirt bag but please break it off. As much as I'd like to say talk it out, you've done that before and it didn't work. I'm not trying to blame you for this so I don't want it to come across that way, but when he questioned why people use they/them pronouns should have been a warning. If you didn't have a talk with him about it I'd recommend it for the future, as long as you're comfortable to do so at least. The stupid tits comment is just weird and honestly a little creepy in my opinion. Yes you can have sexual attraction to whatever body part, but saying how he wouldn't know what to do if you were still a girl or had tits is weird. So what if you were a girl and/or had tits. Why does that change anything? I get it might change if he's attracted to you,but if that's the case why is he dating you? That's not to bash on you but the way he acts makes it seem like he still believes you're a girl when he was explicitly told your not and knows your not cause he acknowledges it. Personally I don't think I have much room to talk about attraction as, yeah I guess it's cool having a person with good looks for a partner, I personally don't care about your gender I just care if you are a decent human being with respect.
Well that’s no longer your boyfriend hun. You can find better
throw the whole boyfriend out
Dump his ass, you can do better.  Don't waste your time with atransphobe when you could find someone who's not a total dillweed.
Get an apartment and get the fuck out.  This dude is bad news.

Best comment!
This is the way. Bf could be ignorant or struggling with it, himself, but not  malevolent. Make him understand how awful it is for you.

Or, as some others unfortunately tend to do, just assume he's an immutable, transphobic prick out to control and make life hell, instead of a human. While this *could* be true, I think that beginning with such an assumption could be a dangerous pattern.

**We don't know bf well enough** - we only know what was vented, which paints a skewed picture.

Edited for some clarification.
Also a bit weird to be grabbing boobs out of nowhere even if they are there, even if you are in a relationship, hell, even if you're married
I never said he's good or bad but if he 1. Is against nonbinary identity and respecting people's pronouns then he shouldn't be with a nonbinary person. That's basic and 2. Is consistently triggering his partner and making them dysphoric for his own gratification.  OP has explained that they feel objectified and silenced. Whether or not OPs partner means to harm them doesn't change the fact that he's done harm. OP can create a boundary here and want educate/see the best in this person while ending an intimate relationship which puts them in psychological stress and pain. 

OP does not owe his partner an education. They do not have to do emotional labor nor rehabilitate this man. They did not sign up to be a gender educator nor is anyone owed a relationship. If this relationship is hurting OP ans making them uncomfortable than that's reason enough to leave. No one has to stay or work on a relationship where they don't feel seen or valued .
I wasn't saying that at you, my apologies for the misunderstanding. I was agreeing with you and explaining why I did.

To your point about the education - I absolutely agree. But there's also something else to consider (or at least that I consider). When someone starts transitioning, their SO also has to reevaluate their sexuality, which can be just as jarring as reevaluating one's identity. This can make things internally awkward for the SO, which could come out poorly in words.

Obviously this all comes down to communication, but, again, this requires both people to be open minded and empathetic toward one another, instead of rushing to conclusions and actions. If anything is truly one-sided, as *depicted* here, then of course it should end.
Your second paragraph really only applies when a someone comes out in an established relationship. That isn't the case here because OP states he has been open about their identity to his partner from the beginning. Most likely the partner wanted to be more affirming in a performative sense to get with OP but in all actuality didn't bother to educate, self-reflect, nor change his perception/bioessentialist perspective. 

That's why I said this should end because the OP's partner walked into a situation uneducated and is now not bothering to even try and is hurting OP. Communication is all well and good but laziness and carelessness shows a problem. OP was open about their identity and their partner didn't bother to do the work necessary to understand that in terms of his sexuality and the harm that's doing isn't on OP to take. We can't be rehabilitation centers for people not trying. Op has indicated they've tried to communicate and that's fallen on deaf ears.

I'm sorry but OP's boyfriend's behavior is inexcusable for someone who knowingly dated a nonbinary trans person. The adjustment period needn't exist. He knew what he walked into and choose to invalidate his partner by viewing them as something they aren't anyway. That's harmful behavior and the OP doesn't have to tolerate it. Especially making comments indicating that the BF is seeing OP as a woman-lite or treating OP's gender expression like a fetish. That's not okay and a form of transphobic  IPV. Op doesn't have to accept that treatment. 

In their edit OP says that he would've broken up by now if they didn't live together. That's all I need to know.
Ohh I didn't see the edit. Yeah, fuck 'em. Thanks for the dialogue though, I appreciate a respectful back and forth.

Edit: I do wanna say, per your statement about established vs new relationships **in general, not for this specific post/instance**. If I found myself falling for someone who simultaneously made me rethink my sexuality, I would be a little weird at first. It still takes some adjusting. I remember the first time I messed around with a guy - there was a bit of muscle memory that I had to work around, and it was definitely awkward for both of us. This is *slightly* within the same vein, for me at least. Every individual is different. 

But yes, fuck that dude. In the vehemently disregard sort of way.

Is... Something supposed to feel different?	"Hey, so I think i might qualify as nb, I'm amab and i feel... Idk, feminine for a guy but not to the extent that i feel I'd consider myself trans, i don't really experience dysphoria (i think) so don't figure that label really fits. I don't even know if nb fits either, because it feels... Pointless? Like, what's it matter if i call myself nb or just a feminine man? It feels like calling myself nb might be like... Too much? Or posing? Idk? Advice? Pls

Edit: i think i figured it out now, I'm test piloting she/her pronouns and some clothes. Gonna steal the other model's tires and if i like em I'll come back for the rest."	"Dysphoria isn't a requirement to be any gender, including transgender. Transgender means to experience a gender that doesn't solely and completely align with one's AGAB. Non-binary means not aligning with either of the two traditional western gender boxes solely and completely. Non-binary falls under the trans umbrella. So, if you feel like your experience of gender isn't solely and completely that of a man, non-binary is available for you to describe that experience. You're the only one who can decide if that label is right for you, because you're the only one who has lived that experience. If you feel it's accurate to you, then you get to use it. There's no other requirement.
It took me years to accept and be who I am. Sometimes people just know and sometimes we are unsure because of imposter syndrome and random gatekeeping. 
The fact you question it all shows you are looking and searching. That does imply you are on the edge of something.
Talk to someone you love and trust. Write a private journal to sort your thoughts.

Always remember you are valid whatever you decide. Nobody has claims on your gender ID or life.

Good luck!🏳️‍🌈😉
I don't have an answer for you, but you're not alone. I have very similar feelings about being AFAB and sometimes feeling like maybe I'm not actually a woman all the time. And yet, it would affect basically nothing whether I decide to identify as cis or NB. Neither option feels entirely right to me. I'm honestly very confused about what a gender actually is and how the heck I'm supposed to know I have one.
I'd say, call yourself nb if it makes you feel happy or feels helpful to you, call yourself a feminine guy if it makes you happy or feels helpful to you. All of these labels are not so much (or, actually, at all) about what someone qualifies as according to some definition (bc srsly, who would even have the authority to define those things?), but rather what words we can use to communicate things about ourselves to others - how we feel, how we want to be seen, how we want to be treated. It's all a very inexact science! It's about what WORKS, not about looking at a few preconceived categories and picking one to adhere to.

The way i figured out i was nb was by looking at groups of people and what they said about their experiences, and seeing whom i could relate to the most. Sure, i had some experiences and thoughts and feelings in common with some men and women, but over all, i felt the most comfortable being grouped with all the rest. I didn't relate 100% to what every nonbinary person said or did ever, but the overlap was larger than with any other group. In the end, it was just clear that if i told people i was nonbinary, then they got a pretty good idea of what kind of person i was, which experiences they could sort of expect me to have, what preferences i would be likely to have. At least it fit better than if i had claimed to be a woman or a man. Sometimes, it's not about finding a shoe that fits perfectly, but just one that fits better than the others you have tried! 

And in the end, if you've found some words to describe yourself that you're pretty comfortable with and that work for you, you can even decide what exactly those words mean TO YOU, and tell other people about that if you want. Like, for me being nonbinary might mean one thing, for a friend it might mean something a bit different. Just like being a man or a woman means slightly different things to those men and women. Again, inexact science! It's all a tool to help you describe yourself, never a box you need to fit yourself into. Good luck!
One recommendation I’ve seen that helped me think about gender is to imagine your brain floating in an empty void. Nothing else around. You’re not connected with your body or outward appearance. It’s just your thoughts and feelings.

In that context, if you had to name your gender, what would you name it? Are you male, female, man, woman, both, neither, do you go back and forth, etc.?

That’s your gender identity. What you feel like; who you innately “know” you are.

Also, it’s helpful to remember that your gender identity is separate from your gender expression. They can inform one another, but one doesn’t dictate the other.

Hope this helps!
I was in the same spot for a long while. the reason I claim nb now is because sometimes I'll be like ""ok if you're not, then you're a man"" and that just doesn't make sense when I think about it. like I have no attachment to that concept and it doesn't feel right calling myself one. any deviation outside the two binary genders makes you nb, if you want it to. yes there are probably a lot more people who would consider themselves nb if our society was better lol. from a practical standpoint, you don't need to go changing your legal gender or coming out to your parents or whatever. maybe share with a couple close friends, test drive some other pronouns and presentations and see what happens.
Check the word “qualify”.
Almost always, it carries the weight of societal judgement
You can just be a feminine man. Nothing wrong with that. You also don't have to pick a label. Just be yourself and vibe.
This sounds a lot like me tbh. At first I was unsure about the non-binary label, I felt weird with it but I knew I wanted to use he/they pronouns and ‘cis’ felt equally weird, albeit more familiar and comfortable. 

I used ‘genderqueer’ for a little bit, but sometimes non-binary was just easier and required less explanation, and I found that with use it lost its unfamiliarity and I really started to like it. Though it’s technically an umbrella term it suits me just fine on its own. I identify as a non-binary male, and those who care to know more specifically what that means for me can get to know me and learn for themselves. (:
You go with the label that feels comfy for you. If calling yourself nonbinary feels like ""too much, posing or pointless"", then you don't have to do it, you are 100% valid labelling yourself as a ""feminine man"" if that's what feels right for you.

It's different for everyone and a label like that always has do be self-prescribed instead of something you have to ""qualify for"" tbh. I'm an enby and even tho I'm amab (and not on HRT and not even presenting very 'queerly' most of the time), it feels uncomfortable as hell referring to myself as a man, even a ""feminine"" one. I tried that for years and the shoe just didn't fit.

If it does for you, congratulations, you found the label that's comfortable for you. That's what it's all about in the end imo.
I feel the same to an extent. I’m not sure if non-binary fits me either, I don’t get dysphoric, it doesn’t feel like a perfect label for me but it just feels… logical to use this term for me. It’s okay to use it if you don’t identify with it 100% even if it’s just until you find a label that fits you best and I don’t believe anything’s supposed to feel different, nothing felt different for me at least =]
If you're unsure whether you have dysphoria, try reading this - [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en), it's a great resource for figuring things out.
That's how I felt. I didn't feel a great change, I just realized I had no particularly strong attachment to manhood or womanhood.
Being nonbinary/trans isn’t necessarily about dysphoria. It can just be about euphoria. If calling yourself by a certain label makes you feel better, then that’s something you might use! Honestly all it boils down to is what you want. Do you want to call yourself nonbinary? If so, then do it! The only people who will stop you are assholes. (I’m nonbinary btw and this is basically the thought process that lead me to accept that I was)
Ah, welcome my friend. The most important thing is you must understand, labels arent for everyone, the joys of life is you can be whoever and whatever you want. 

Now, a few things that helped me when I felt the same as you;

1. consider how you would feel about your gender, regardless of your physical body (thought experiment, what if you were born AFAB? would you still feel somewhere between man/woman?)
2. Rather than thinking about dysphoria, consider what counts as gender Euphoria, what makes you happy, and comfortable with your gender expression?
3. understand, that gender identity is something you can, and might change your mind on, life is long, and you dont need answers. 
4. consider what you mean by ""posing"". for me I felt like that because all examples of Enby people I could find where AFAB. Its an ongoing issue within the LGBT community that AMAB enby people are extremely underrepresented. 
5. Its ok to just be a feminine man! many people are! be whatever makes you comfortable <3. 

good luck
I understand your confusion. I am amab, identifying as nb for a while now. I have never presented my feminine side much, outside of nail polish.

 During the past week or so, maybe a bit more, I have wondered if I may be trans, as I have felt a surge of feminity in me.

At the same time, I like the masculine parts of me. I do have some female envy, but mostly regarding clothing. And I don't feel especially like a man, nor like a woman. That being said, I'm okay with people using him/he.

So yeah, really confused here too! But I think what I'm going through is a reaffirmation or a deepening of my non binariness, if you will. Or I'm more fully embracing it. 

I bought a few piece of women's clothing online, I am excited to try it on! I am looking forward to see how it feels and how I look. I'm also hoping it will help me figuring out what I am/confirm I am truly nb.
Based mostly on the posts I've seen here, the feelings you're describing are basically mandatory. Welcome to the collective :)
Hey! Maybe throw around the term ""gender non conforming"", because from your description, that seems to fit best to me. Obviously, you know yourself best, so do what you gotta do. 
Also, thinking you may be non binary, or trans, and then coming to the conclusion later that you're not is totally okay! Feel around and wiggle around in your gender performance and expression; try new things and see how they feel!
Have you looked into Cassgender? It describes someone who has a gender, but doesn’t necessarily feel that it’s important to their identity.
Or Nuetroi (I think I spelled that right). It’s kind of like agender, but more passive. Not nothing, just neutral.
I’m personally of the opinion that it would do most people some good to do some gender exploration and introspection. Even if you you end up deciding that yes, you actually are a cis man, that’s cool too! You’ll be approaching masculinity deliberately, and with more self-knowledge than before. But you don’t need dysphoria to be nonbinary. I don’t have much body dysphoria myself. I am agender- I have no strong ties to any particular gender. It doesn’t hurt me to be perceived as female as I often am, but there’s nothing inside of me that is “woman.”

My journey so far has been like this: I got interested in reading about trans experiences as I started meeting trans people, and as people I care about began to come out. I wanted to be as supportive, respectful, and generally kind as possible, so educating myself seemed like a good starting point. As I started thinking more about gender in the abstract, and gender as it applies to others, I also started thinking about gender as it applies to myself. Because I am AFAB, I started thinking about womanhood. I tried to define what womanhood actually is, and I realized that there really is no unifying trait or detail that *all women* AND *only women* experience. For every trait, behavior, or experience I could think of, I could also think of examples of women who *don’t* share or experience it, and also people who are not women who *do*. The only unifying aspect of womanhood that I could come up with was the strong internal sense that one is, in fact, a woman. And I don’t have that.

There’s a thought experiment I used to explain the concept of being transgender to my stepson when he asked. I led him through a series of questions about his relationship to his body (for example “if you didn’t have your left hand, would you still be male?” “Yes, I’d still be a guy” “what about if you didn’t have your legs, would you still be male?” “Yup, still male”) that led all the way to the conclusion of “Ok, what about if you were a disembodied mind- no brain, no body, no meat, just your consciousness- do you think you’d still be male?” “Yeah, I think I’d still be a guy”  “And if we put your mind into a robot body, would you be a boy robot?” “Yeah, I’d be a guy robot”. Basically to break down the idea of gender as separate from the body, and then introduce the concept of peoples’ genders not lining up with their physical bodies. 

So when I later started interrogating my own gender, I realized that my answers to the robot questions were different- if my consciousness was stuck in a robot body, I *wouldn’t* be a female robot, *because I do not have a strong internal sense of gender.* Once I realized that, it was like I’d unlocked a new perspective on so many details of my life that I had ignored in the past because I didn’t have the framework to understand it at the time. When I said I don’t have body dysphoria before that wasn’t 100% true- I do sometimes wish my breasts were just not there I sometimes, but surely every woman feels that way sometimes, right? And Freud said all that shit about penis envy, surely every woman wishes she had one of those sometimes, right? And *everyone* wishes they could grow a nice full beard, right? And didn’t every girl habitually steal her dad’s clothes? Well, no- that’s not a universal feminine experience. In hindsight, those were all early genderqueer signs that I just didn’t have the context to recognize and process yet.

And since I’ve been able to name this aspect of myself, I’ve also been able to recognize moments of gender *euphoria* too! Gender euphoria is such an important concept that doesn’t get talked about much outside of trans spaces. It’s the opposite of gender dysphoria; moments where you feel your gender intensely in a positive way. For a binary trans person, this could be moments where someone gives them gender-appropriate compliments- calling a trans woman glamorous and lovely, for example- moments where they pass, moments when they notice their bodies looking the way they want them to, that sort of thing. For a nonbinary person, this can be extremely varied, since nonbinary is an extremely broad and varied concept. But the point is, if something makes you feel especially masculine, or feminine, or ambiguous, etc- good in a very ‘gender-y’ way- that’s gender euphoria. My sideburns give me gender euphoria. My biceps give me gender euphoria. The one time I lifted a tree into a lady’s car and she called me a stud gave me such major gender euphoria I still think about it years later. Same with the time an old guy customer at work called me “boss” instead of “sweetheart.”

So anyway I don’t have advice, but I hope something here might help you on your gender journey. In my opinion, vocabulary and labels can be extremely helpful, but you don’t have to land on the one perfect term right out the bat. It’s ok to change your mind as you grow and change and learn more about yourself. It’s a never-ending process, and this is definitely one of those times when where you end up is less important than the journey to get there.
My experience is very similar to yours. I also felt like nb was overkill or like I was encroaching on something I didn't have the rights to. But then I slowly started dressing androgynously and told my friends that could use any pronouns for me since that made it easier to go back. 

And for a while I felt stupid. Like I was demanding to be part of something I was not. But after a while my imposter syndrome faded and now I more or less feel comfortable calling myself agender. I still don't have a sense of what gender is but conforming to being a specific gender has always felt kind of limiting? Like I wasn't allowed to do certain things or be certain ways because it didn't match my agab's stereotypes. 

But since I ditched dresses and ""being pretty"" I've felt so much more comfortable being me. I also recently cut my hair which was really nice. Don't get me wrong, I loved having long hair but short hair makes me feel like I can present completely genderlessly.

And a dead giveaway for me was also my life-long desire to confuse people to the max. Whether it be my gender, my speech or anything really. Confusion and chaos is my aesthetic so when I realised that also applied to my gender I had to accept that imposter syndrome is a bitch...

I also used to worry a lot about whether I was feminine enough and thought the other girls would make fun of my deep voice or broad shoulders. I now know this was me feeling pressured to look and act a certain way which cause me to feel very anxious...

Dunno if this helps at all but this is what I go off of...
Check into gender euphoria. Dysphoria isn't required to be trans/nonbinary. Sometimes people get excited to be read as a different gender than their agab. Some nonbinary folx see things the way you've described. For instance, I normally don't care what gender I'm read as. But, of course, it is perfectly fine to just feel like a feminine man. Dont feel like you have to put yourself into a box you don't feel fits.
Well I’m my experience men can be feminine without counting as nonbinary, it really just comes down to how it feels to you as difficult as that is. If you feel like you want to label yourself as nonbinary than you are nonbinary and if you don’t 
want to than you don’t have to just because you’re feminine
A point of confusion i have is: by that definition it feels like almost everybody would qualify as nb. Like, aren't most people at least a bit feminine and masculine? Where is the line? Not trying to discount anybody, just that's what my brain says, could be imposter syndrome or what have you but.
Exactly bro, I completely agree with that.
[removed]
This. Exactly this.
Same boat here! I don’t really feel like a woman but it also would impact basically nothing about my life to “come out” as enby? I’m fact I’m hesitant to “come out” bc the whole point is that I’m not clear on/comfortable with my gender identity so why would I make it a huge topic of conversation??? 

The big sticking point for me is that I’m very “curvy” which basically forces me to present fully “woman” (men’s clothes literally don’t fit) and take on all the societal bullshit that comes with that. So some dysphoria there…
Hmm, so, i guess here's something that may help you help me lol, in middle school i used to think to myself that maybe i was a lesbian in a boy's body, but like, okay with that? I never felt masculine at all. Nowadays, I'm really not sure, i don't know what's masculine or feminine beyond the super extreme examples that are frankly just examples of toxic masculinity or femininity. And i can't tell if I've just grown from back then and become more accepting of how i feel, or if i just got really used to the shell i put up to maybe get made fun of less for being sensitive and stuff
Oh this is a really interesting way to think of it, thank you. So... some people feel like their disembodied brain has a gender? That is... interesting. You have given me much to think on, I appreciate it.
That makes sense i spose, it's more just, i guess I'm struggling to figure out how much certain things matter to me, and what how much things might mean that i thought didn't mean anything lol
Well see, my issue is more, I'm struggling with figuring out how much certain things about it matter to me i guess?
I also identify as non-binary male! I’m not 100% sure since no one around me really uses the pronouns or name/nicknames that I put into place.
I think i struggle because i don't know if I'm comfortable, indifferent, or ignorant. Like I'm ok being called a man, but also I'd be fine being called a woman, I've been mistaken as one a few times and it did give me an interesting feeling, but I'm not sure if it was like, gender euphoria or just amusement at the fact i confused the people who did it lol. I enjoy defying the expectations people assign to gender, since i think the way most people perceive it is shitty, so seeing those people stumble over it is amusing. So i guess I'm just not sure how much if any of that amusement/happiness is like, relevant? I also don't know what euphoria might feel like. I think I'm general i just don't know what I'm looking for.
Oh, wowzers, thanks lol
See, for me, I think that until i started realizing, after seeing what others here said, maybe i had been writing euphoria i had experienced in the past off, i saw gender as more of a i guess tool to help others view you in a certain way. Now, i think maybe I'm starting to get it, still confused but
Best of luck figuring it out friend! I'm in a similar boat after hearing what people here said. Feel much more comfy in my nbness, gonna do some exploring, see what happens.
Do i get my Alphabet Mafia membership card now?
Gender isn't the same as personality or style. You're allowed to just be a feminine man and not put any other labels on it. If you're comfortable with the label then it's your label.
oh absolutely. i don't feel like anything and i thought i was cis for the longest time because every other cis person in my life also expressed not having a connection to their gender so i just thought gender was like- made up basically and i didnt understand non-binary folk, like how can you be both masculine and feminine when neither exist except as body types. yeah turns out i was pretty damn wrong oop. I really think a lot more cis people are trans than they realize just because it doesn't affect them. Never affected me either so I probably never would have known in any other environment. Does this make me de facto cis? Maybe. Does it diminish the fact that I don't feel like *any* gender at all? No. In the end the only way to judge this is just looking at yourself and asking if you feel like your agab, not based on other people or your idea of qualifying, but just what is *your* feeling?
Being a feminine man doesn’t make one non-binary. A feminine man is still a man. A masculine woman is still a woman. A person can be gender non conforming and still be cisgender. Being non-binary means falling somewhere outside of that man-woman binary. If you’re comfortable with being a man, even if a feminine one, you might not be non-binary. If you feel that ‘man’ doesn’t accurately describe your gender, then that’s another story.
I’m a trans man. I was born with a female body but I experience gender dysphoria around being perceived as female, and gender euphoria around being perceived as male. I have the symptoms of being trans such as feeling disconnected from my body, feeling sickened by the primary and secondary sex characteristics of my AGAB, and transitioning helps to treat these symptoms. This makes me trans.

**EDIT: NOT EVERYONE EXPERIENCES DYSPHORIA. Some people find gender EUPHORIA to be an easier indicator, as dysphoria can be hard to distinguish from other mental health issues. I do not suffer from anxiety, depression, or any other major mental health issues, so dysphoria is an easy indicator for me.**

This is going to be really simplified. People’s brains have gender, and those physical characteristics come in a spectrum. Most people have a binary male or female brain that aligns with their physical body. For some people, the brain develops gendered characteristics that differ from their body. This is how you get trans and non-binary people—dysphoria and euphoria are physical responses caused by whether or not the brain’s natural expectation (Gender A) lines up with perception of the body (Gender B).

However, I sometimes like to wear girl’s clothes (just like a cis femboy might). I think it’s fun to do makeup and paint my nails. I like wearing heels sometimes because being short sucks. This is a reflection of *personal style* rather than *gender identity*. 

Girls can be masculine. Boys can be feminine. **Unless they experience gender dysphoria or gender euphoria**, their preferences do not make them trans.

No one can tell you if you’re trans or enby. You have to figure that out for yourself—we can only share information. I recommend you do some reading on the LGBT and Gender wikis. You may learn about an identity that describes exactly what you are feeling.
You say that everybody could qualify as nb but that is a very nb way to think. Many people have very strong opinions on their assigned gender. Heck, look at toxic masculinity and the very perception of something as “girly.”
Gender is different than gender expression. If you were born and assigned male and consider yourself to be a man, you're cis. It doesn't matter if you like feminine things. If you identify with your agab you're cis. If so, congratulations! There's nothing wrong or lesser about being either cis or trans, they're just different. 

If you're looking for a label that fits you, maybe consider femboy? It literally means a boy who is feminine and doesn't inherently indicate being cis or trans.

I'm not saying definitively whether you are cis or not, it just sounds to me like you identify with your agab, but I am not you so I really can't say.
I think imposter syndrome might be at play here. If you’re at that level where you are beyond the gender binary in your thinking, you of course qualify but you can be whatever you want. Feminine men exist. Masculine women exist. But you’re here, maybe take a deep dive within to figure it out.
This is absolutely not true.
Not so. Being transgender just requires one to feel more comfortable as something other than one's AGAB. It doesn't require one to be uncomfortable with their AGAB. And that's an important distinction. Requiring discomfort to be trans pathologizes being trans, makes it a condition or a disorder or a disease. Being trans isn't a disorder, and requiring some negative experience in order to be trans means that being trans is something that must be managed, or treated, or cured. That's not ok. Trans people are valid in their identities, and don't need to be cured.
I'm glad we can be confused together; it feels validating. Here's hoping we both figure it out someday!
This may be something you just have to reflect on more. Gender is complex. And you don’t have to have an answer right away; even though it’d be really nice if it was that fast. It’s a journey to figure this stuff out. Don’t feel like you have to rush it. It can also help to talk with someone you trust and that will be supportive of you.
> ""maybe i was a lesbian in a boy's body, but like, okay with that""

OHMAIGAWD I THOUGHT THIS TOO! I'm afab and thought I was a gay guy in a girl's body but I never told anybody cuz it sounded like the stupidest thing in my own head. I'm not alone =TwT=

edit words
Omg in high school I used to feel like a gay flamboyant boy in a girl's body! Was also ok with that. No answers, I just completely relate to you in not feeling any connection to the concept of gender. I just can't understand it as separate by gender constructs or performance. It is def a completely individual experience. I'm not coming out yet, although I've been thinking of myself as gender fluid more and more, going from a cis type of identity to a more personal one. But no idea of what gender is or feels like ahah
I don’t know if anyone thinks of their gender in the context of their “disembodied brain“, but this thought exercise is useful in that it allows for thinking of your gender separately from your body and outward appearance. Your gender identity can be informed by your body and appearance, but your gender is it’s own thing. And it’s perfectly valid to feel like you don’t have a gender; that’s what being agender is. :)
well after torturing myself for like two years thinking about it all the time I found it helpful to just, stop. accept you don't know and that it doesn't really matter. I was like that for awhile, and then when I eventually revisited it I had more clarity.
That's completely valid. You don't have to know something right away, or ever. It's also okay if you'll never figure it out yk. Words are weird and the self is an even weirder thing. Don't overthink it too much or worry too much about, just so what makes you happy and comfortable
Euphoria is an intense feeling of happiness, some people describe it as being on “cloud 9.”

For example: every time I get called “androgynous” (very rare) or “sir” or a “man” I feel like I’m floating on clouds — I.e. I’m really really happy.

I think for you, you need to do some tests. Pick some pronouns that you think you might like and ask your closest friends if they would mind calling you those pronouns for a while —I’d say anywhere from a month to two months.

If at any time you don’t experience euphoria or if you experience dysphoria (the feeling of being in the wrong body, that you need to change your body to fit the pronouns, etc), then try out a different pair of pronouns.

Dysphoria isn’t the best indicator that it’s the right gender for you, in fact it can point to the opposite (I experienced dysphoria when I called myself “trans” — feeling as if that wasn’t the right gender/that my body didn’t fit that gender).

There is more than one type of non-binary pronouns than they/them so feel free to try any and all of them that sound/feel right to you.

Repeat this process until you find the pronouns that fit best for you.

If it’s he/him you could be either cis or non-binary.

If it’s they/them or a variation of they/them, you might be non-binary or somewhere under the agender umbrella.

If it’s she/her, you might be trans or non-binary.

If a combination of two or more of the above, you might be bigender, gender fluid, or non-binary with a specific gender (I’m a non-binary male for example).

Note: you don’t have to experience dysphoria to be trans.

Note 2: you can be non-binary but prefer specific pronouns (for example if you don’t fit in the gender binary but you prefer male or female pronouns).

Note 3: your gender expression has very little to do with your gender identity. An example is this: I’m non-binary male but I enjoy wearing dresses, makeup, and heels occasionally.

Feel free to choose whatever fits best for you and don’t forget to research. Read about the different labels and see if any describe what your feelings/comes close to what your feelings. That’s a good indicator that it might be a good fit for you.

I hope this helped!
You don’t have to know your exact gender. God knows I don’t (honestly I don’t really want to either. It’s just There). All I know is that I’m not a boy or girl, y’know? Whatever works for you works for you. Anyone who says something against it is being an asshole.
You nailed it!  Men can feminine without being non-binary or fluid. I would like to point out the music industry, Dave Navarro, Steven Tyler, Kirk Hammett all these masculine men have women’s flair in there style.
Heck, that really resonates, thanks, not sure where it leaves me since i have trouble *feeling* due to trauma, but at least i have an idea.
I think there's a distinction between how a cis person might feel like they're not really that strongly relating to their agab - because they're cis and it's just not a matter of contemplation for them, it's just their ""normal"" - and an agender person for example, who might feel very strongly about not being their agab because ""being their agab"" feels wrong to them.

""I really think a lot more cis people are trans than they realize"" is kind of a weird statement in that way. Because gender identity is self-prescribed. Someone's cis as long as they're saying they're cis tbh.
See, i don't know what comfortable versus uncomfortable in that regard would feel like
That makes alot of sense, i think i can safely say I'm nb. I'm... Curious with the trans label cuz, i have maybe experienced gender euphoria, i just dismissed it at the time possibly.

Also, I'm very confused on the topic of the term femboy, because i was under the impression it was kinda a slur towards trans folks, but that seems to be not the case, so... What constitutes a femboy i suppose?
See that's the thing, i figure there must be some other like, aspect of gender to relate to that isn't the toxic or extreme examples of each, but, i don't see them really?
This really resonates for me — I didn’t have the concept of trans/enby growing up but I just assumed that all AFAB people hated xyz feminine thing and were just being coerced into it by the patriarchy (dresses, makeup, heels, certain behaviors). So it was like, “I’m a woman and fuck the patriarchy”. As I’ve collected more life experience and interacted with more people I  realize that some people actually genuinely enjoy that stuff and started reflecting on my own gender and realized I’m enby (still fuck the patriarchy though)
I think the best way to say it, is i don't hate my agab, but i certainly don't think it's the best term to use, this whole thing has helped me figure out alot, like, i wouldn't really consider myself a man i don't think... But i don't know what I'd consider myself otherwise? Like, it's a weird concept to me, though i think I'm also not considering how I've changed my feelings about it recently too. I'm still very confused about gender being different from expression, like, what *is* it then, cuz if asked what gender i feel most like i guess I'd just shrug?
Do you have any kind of reasoning for that???
Same lol!
I KNEW I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
Well, given everything that I've learned today, I'm more confident in the nb label, but I'm not sure quite what to do with that lol. Plan to experiment with some stuff though
It has helped a bit, i may try messing with pronouns, but I'm unsure how to bring it up, it feels like a weird ask
I just mean cis strictly in the sense that their gender is the same as their assigned one at birth, you can still *identify* as cis if that's not true. I mean yeah a cis person might not think about their gender but I mean like the cis(genderless) people that don't understand the concept of gender being not the same as sex because they don't know gender as a feeling. the cis(genderless) people who tell me they wouldn't care if they woke up a different gender. Or the cis(genderless) people that say they don't feel like a man or a woman. (yeah i thought this was the cissest shit ever lmao)
Well, I can only speak for myself, but when I have to do things like check a male/female box on a form, or when someone calls me a man or woman, or having to strictly identify myself as one or the other, it never felt right. It’s not always easy to explain what that feels like. If you’re cool with being a man, calling yourself such, being seen as such, etc. then you’re probably not non-binary. But where that line is, it can be different for everyone. Some people might be fine with it but still feel they are NB. But I think if it feels pointless to you, don’t feel you have to do it, either. You can be gender nonconformist, be a feminine man, etc, without being a different gender.
I felt a lot like yourself when I started this journey of self discovery I've been on. I've always felt quite comfortable in my masculinity, but I never had any attachment to my male-ness, if you will. Though that's not to say I was dissatisfied with it, quite the contrary. But the system of gender never made sense to me from a very early age for the same reasons you give in your original post. I think I understand how and why others identify with their genders but I personally just always felt somewhere outside. Could never reconcile it in my mind because I felt so comfortable in my skin. I'm not quite to the point of fully embracing my NBness. But something that helped me, that really gave me the push to move forward, was when I one day imagined friends using they/them pronouns for me. I've never in my life felt gender dysphoria, but in that moment, I think I experienced gender euphoria. If there can be such a thing. It's all still kinda scary to me and that's largely what holds me back. But I've decided who I want to be the first I specifically ask.

I hope that helps in some way.
Femboy is a slur if used to refer to a trans woman as a means of invalidating her gender.

Guys who enjoy crossdressing or intentionally dressing/doing makeup to look feminine, while still identifying as male, sometimes call themselves femboys, in which case it is not a slur.

Edit: In the first scenario it’s a slur because the person is telling a trans woman she falls under the second category—a man pretending to be a woman/feminine—when she *is* really a woman.
Not the person you were talking to, but most 30+ year old trans people I know say they don't have gender dysphoria.

Like this one lady who runs a p big trans meet group in Houston once told us: ""I don't have dysphoria, I wasn't uncomfortable with being a man, I just knew I wasn't one."" (Roughly translated from Spanish)
I mean this sub tends to throw the label nb at everyone and everything imo. Personally i also disagree with the whole ""you don't need dysphoria to be trans"" stuff cause it simply doesn't make sense in any way. Why would you want to be trans if you don't feel uncomfortable with your body or with how people percieve you? Men can be feminine/androgynous and women can be masculine/androgynous without being trans. You can like and dress however the fuck you want, use make up however you want etc without being trans. I feel like people start forgetting that it's okay to be cis. That's not a bad thing lol. You can be cis and still present however the fuck you want. You can even be cis and use a different name. 

The term trans is for people who transition imo... Not just through hormones n stuff but also socially - like changing your pronouns. But if you literally don't transition in any way, then you're not trans. Otherwise everyone would just be trans and then that word would loose it's meaning. 

I mean, i don't know how it's to be you and what exactly you experience. You gotta figure that out by yourself. But i think it's important to still keep that critical voice -- I'm not talking about the shitty voice that likes to tell us that we suck, i mean the critical voice that goes like ""wait, maybe there's more to this, maybe I'm wrong, maybe i should think this through again"". I'm constantly questioning myself tbh. I just don't like when people hear one thing that they like and then run with that without ever really reflecting if it makes even any sense. 

Like it's totally okay to think that you're trans and then realize that you're cis. Maybe I'm also just cis. I don't know. I just think it's annoying how everyone in this sub just encourages new people to identify as nb/trans when like -- that's not exactly a fun thing? It comes with a lot of problems. I don't know why anyone would want to be part of a discriminated minority... If you're perfectly comfortable with yourself and you just prefer stuff that's non-stereotypical for your AGAB thennn...congrats you're comfortable with yourself and know what you like! 

Sorry for this long rant, i just hope I'm getting my point across. I think self reflection is the key to a lot of problems we have cause sometimes we might see problems where none are, and maybe there's something completely different lying underneath that's actually causing us to feel unhappy with the way we are.
If they already know about the LGBTQ+ community, slowly bring it up in conversation with them. If not, introduce them to the concept patiently. They may have trouble accepting it at first, but they should come around.

That being said: if they frequently willfully use your dead name/pronouns despite you correcting them then they be transphobic and you need better a friend(s). Not everyone is like this so keep yourself safe and only come out to your friends if they are supportive of the LGBTQ+ community.

It may be awkward at first, but if you’re honest with yourself and them, then it should be fine and will get better and with time
I think i also struggle with the concept of the aspects of gender that are not based on presentation, like people are saying it's separate, but that confuses me because like, isn't the gender you identify as the one you would present? What other factors are there, not including comfort in one's body probably?
It does yes, like, i don't... Dislike my masculine traits, i will say with pronouns i feel even more off with it cuz like, i have trouble imagining anything other than being called he/him so idk if I'd like it, and i don't wanna change in case i don't, i hate certain things about my body that are from being male, but i don't dislike my genetalia really, i feel like I'm much more sensitive and soft than men are supposed to be but i don't really feel... feminine? Hope that made sense lol
Ahhh, so i was correct sorta lol
Well i just don't get why you would want to be part of a discriminated minority if you're not uncomfortable with the way things are. Why would you want to make things more complicated for yourself? 

The trans people i know experience really bad dysphoria and being alive is basically hell for them. They would literally kill themselves if they wouldn't be able to transition. They don't have the choice of just living as their AGAB. 

Also just because 30+ people say something doesn't make it more true. 30+ people can also be confused and wrong. Not necessarily saying that the person you mentioned is, because i don't know them, but to just believe whatever someone tells you without ever questioning it is extremely dangerous.
They makes sense, i feel comfortable considering myself nb at this point because 
A: in middle school when concerned about if i was gay (lol if only i knew), the best way i could find to describe how i felt was a lesbian who was okay with being in a male body. I've since found better ways to say that, but that still kinda rings true.
B: i have realized i think i have experienced euphoria on a few occasions when being mistaken for a woman, I'm uncertain for what reasons, i.e. if it was because they called me miss/ma'am and i want that or because i was thrilled at not being confined to my man box.
C: i think i may have been kinda writing off dysphoria i experience too, i don't have a problem with my genetalia, i am largely indifferent about my chest, at least i think, but i do HATE HATE HATE all of my hair except what's on top of my head
I trust they'd be supportive, it's more i struggle heavily with bring able to recognize my own feelings, so I'm scared of bothering people to make that change only to find that i didn't want it and have had them accommodate me for nothing. Which, i know is just my adhd/cptsd talking, but it's a hurdle I'll need to get over probably
I think ""presentation"" in general is complicated. Regardless of how I dress, I have wide hips and large breasts. So unless I want to go through the process of changing my silhouette I always ""present"" as cis female. Even though that thought makes me genuinely sad. Doesn't matter what clothes I wear. Best case scenario, people think I'm a tomboy or a butch lesbian. And personally I have neither the resources, nor the desire to do anything surgically, hormonally, or wear uncomfortable bindings. But sometimes when I'm getting dressed for the day I am full of existential dread about my presentation. At this point in my gender journey I call myself a femmeby or gender fluid, but sometimes I put on a dress and I'm FULLLLL of gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia. And I basically hesitate checking ant gender box on any form. I usually prefer to just tell people I'm queer-- and when they ask if I mean gender or sexual preference I just say ""yes"" lol
Honestly it sounds like you and I have similar but different experiences, but more or less same boat lol My whole life I've felt like I exist in a liminal space, like I'm made up of contradictions. I've always inhabitted this in-between-ness that was so in between it made me feel outside??
There's nothing wrong with asking people to try using different pronouns for you and deciding you prefer he/him (you can be nb and use he/him pronouns). I'm learning that it's very hard to know what you will enjoy until you give it a try.
Yeah, it’s all about context and intent
> want to be part of

I don't ""want"" anything. I am who I am. I didn't get to choose this, and it's not like I could choose *not* to be who I am.

> They would literally kill themselves if they wouldn't be able to transition

Why would suicidality be a requirement to be any gender? Why are cis people allowed to be cis without needing to feel suicidal?

> just believe whatever someone tells you without ever questioning it is extremely dangerous

On the contrary, listening to the experiences of other people is literally the only way to understand their experience of gender. It's not like height where you can measure it from the outside. It's like being hungry or left-handed or in love: it's an internal experience that requires the individual to self-identify and describe their own experience. There's no other way to understand someone else's gender experience other than to listen to them. The idea that we shouldn't listen to the experiences of others is absurd and, to use your word, dangerous. That's how discrimination happens for trans people: cis folks don't listen to the trans person's description of their experience.
> Well i just don't get why you would want to be part of a discriminated minority if you're not uncomfortable with the way things are. Why would you want to make things more complicated for yourself?

I feel this. I’m amab and I am somewhat uncomfortable with the gender binary, and feel non-binary, experience some dysphoria with my male presenting body, but I feel like I have to weigh my discomfort with the alternative of discrimination if I decide to change my presentation. Sigh
I used to think like this because I used to cry for hours about how much I hated my chest. I couldn't imagine how someone could go through the shit I was going through without feeling goddamn awful about it!

Getting on T alleviated a lot of that, and I started to see how suffering shouldn't be a requirement to know who you are.

And, for what it's worth,

The medical professionals who helped me, hell, not just them, but the entirety of Legacy, well known for specializing in the treatment of LGBTQ+ individuals, were accepting, and willing to help trans people without dysphoria.
Yeah so see, that's just exactly what I wanted you to do. Really think about it and question it and look at it from many perspectives. And turns out you do experience dysphoria. 

My intention was never to tell you you're not non binary. I also never said that. I just want to raise awareness that we can't just slap non binary onto anyone who simply doesn't confirm to gender stereotypes (which i feel like has become a trend in this community).
That does sound difficult. I’m sorta the same way, but if you just get it off your chest, then you might feel 100% better, even if it never goes anywhere 🤷‍♀️
Lol at that last bit, but, that makes sense, as someone who's never experimented with dressing feminine, i hadn't really considered the frustration of not looking the way you're trying to present cuz body doesn't work that way. I wasn't aware until a bit ago after posting this that dysphoria/euphoria/dysmorphia wasn't unique to being trans? So that also makes it make more sense
Yeah, also, as another person here put it, I'm so confused what a gender actually is idk how the heck I'm supposed to know i have one
>I don't ""want"" anything. I am who I am. I didn't get to choose this, and it's not like I could choose not to be who I am.

Then you are not who I'm talking about, are you? If you know who you are, then why do you feel attacked by my opinion?

>Why would suicidality be a requirement to be any gender? Why are cis people allowed to be cis without needing to feel suicidal?

You misunderstood. I wanted to portrait how much being trans can affect someone and that it's not just a quirky label you can use for yourself. It's obviously not a requirement, but something we should be aware of. 

>It's not like height where you can measure it from the outside.

If you would've read my comment properly you would've read that i don't know that persons experience so i can't judge them. All I'm saying is we should keep the meaning of the terms trans and non-binary and not just slap it onto anyone cause otherwise it'll just loose it's meaning. I'm trying to encourage people to reflect on their problems and identity and question themselves. That's the only way we can continue to grow as a person. Don't just accept something someone told you online or wherever. It's something you gotta figure out on your own by your own for yourself.
Yeah same in a way. I'm AFAB and presenting mostly androgynous but still on the feminine side so people just read me as lesbian or some bs because of stereotypes... I'm happy to have a supportive friend group but yah it's very strange. I don't think my dysphoria and struggles are as bad as the ones of binary trans people (judging by what I've seen my trans friends go through) so i always put their needs first. Society sadly won't just suddenly accept non-binary people. Not even cis women are treated the same as cis men. It's sad but we can't just be 3 steps ahead than the rest of society. Of course we should try to live our lives the way we want but at the end of the day we have to take care of sexism first and then the discrimination against binary trans people before society is ready to accept that there are also people outside the gender binary. I'll always fight for women and trans rights, but more because others need them.
Oh yeah, i get ya, didn't make me feel that way at all
True, and like someone else has reassured me, if they get mad for changing my mind later, that's on them, cuz it's not like i asked for that
I've specifically taken gender, women, and sexuality classes. I could give you a pretty detailed description of how academic spaces define gender but I personally still don't really get it. I might never, I think I just don't experience it lol but still have to navigate it
The best way for me was: what gives me euphoria? Talking about my experiences out of the gender binary gave me euphoria, and also a little fear. I kept exploring with pronouns, with labels (demigirl and genderfae were the ones that ""clicked"" for me) but yeah, there is no right or wrong way.

Also, some people are gender apathetic. Or agender. Humans are really varied and gender is an abstract way to experience yourself and your relation to society, how you would want to be perceived, called, etc ❤️
You might feel comfortable with us over in /r/agender. :)
> Then you are not who I'm talking about, are you?

My point is that *no one chooses their gender.* So, if you say it about *anyone*, you are wrong.

> why do you feel attacked by my opinion?

Because it actively harms transgender and non-binary people?

>  it's not just a quirky label you can use for yourself

Your argument is that being transgender is something so terrible that we shouldn't use it lightly because it will ""lose its meaning."" But it's meaning isn't terrible, so your assertion has no basis. If you recognize that being trans doesn't require any sort of discomfort, and that the discomfort some trans people experience is because of the society they live in rather than their identity, then you have to accept that the term being used for people who don't experience discomfort doesn't cause it to lose its meaning. 

If pain isn't part of the meaning, then using it for people who aren't in pain doesn't change its meaning.

> you would've read that i don't know that persons experience

Please. You were making generalized statements about people who are using the trangender label in a way you don't like. This was never about one specific individual. If you're going to make general statements about how people should label themselves, don't be surprised when someone responds about people in general.

> It's something you gotta figure out on your own by your own for yourself.

Exactly. It's up to the individual to decide if their experience is appropriately described by the label transgender. Ie, it's not up to *you*. You don't get to decide that people shouldn't call themselves trans, but that's what you've been doing this whole thread. If it's something we have to each figure out on our own, then it's not your place to dictate to someone else what words they use to describe their own experiences. Soooo, stop?
Okay good :)
Not the person you're replying to, but oh my god academic discussions of gender just absolutely melt my brain. I'm an anthropology student, and when we started talking about what gender is... well, I'm questioning my identity even more than previously because I just don't get it at all.
I'll be looking at it to see if it clicks better, got lots to research lol
I'm tired of explaining myself. You take fragments of my comment to interpret your perception of what I'm saying into them. Criticism is not something negative. It's okay to question people. It's okay wanting to make others think. What you forget is that people can also be confused and think they're trans when in reality they are not, but if no one ever is criticizing them and trying to look at what's really underneath their struggles they might become just even more confused and unhappy over time. Like of course we need to respect other people's experience, but sometimes their experience can also be fogged and they can't figure it out themselves. We shouldn't just encourage people to be trans. We should also actually question themselves. Cause surprise, cis people can be unhappy with their body or the way others percieve them too for multiple of reasons. This is so much more complex. There are so many layers and gender is just one of many. 

This is the last comment I'm writing on this thread. I've said everything i mean and idc if you continue to project this picture of the evil truscum onto me or whatever. If you only read what you want to read in my comments then it's not my fault that you can't think critical and view a topic from another standpoint. There is not just one truth or one right way to see a topic and if you want it or not, the opposite opinion to yours also has valid points that are worth to be considered.
>  idc if you continue to project this picture of the evil truscum onto me

The comment you've now deleted literally states that dysphoria is a requirement to be transgender, which is the single core component of the truscum point of view. I find it quite odd that you say you stand by everything you've written, but also deleted a comment you wrote.

Your position that we should restrict how people identify, and that dysphoria is a requirement to be trans, are both actively harmful to the transgender and non-binary population. It's entirely possible to encourage people to question themselves, and it's entirely possible for people to be cis despite having dysphoria, without gatekeeping our language or pathologizing our experience. I'm glad to hear that you won't be contributing such nonsense here anymore. Best of luck to you.

"would a person be""non-binary"" if they just hate all generalizations and stereotypes and just want to be treated as an individual person?"	"I am AMAB with a very masculine outer appearance. I don't have any dysphoria about my physical body. It is just what it is and I don't really care about it. I think of my body as the spaceship that my brain drives around.

But the vast majority of masculine stereotypes are not accurate for me. I have always hated societal gender roles/norms/stereotypes. Any time the term ""man"" is applied I want to immediately throw on 15 disclaimers to clarify that I am not what people automatically want to assume a ""man"" is. I am not a woman either.

I really just want to be treated as an individual person and not the average of 4 billion other people. Does that classify as non-binary?"	"Depends on if you wish to use the label „nonbinary“ for yourself.
I once met a person who didn‘t want to use any label, because they all had to much gender in them. Other people who feel the same way might want to use that label though.
Social dysphoria can happen independently to physical dysphoria, it sounds like that might be what you are feeling.             
The thing about lgbt terms, is they are meant for you before they are meant for others. What you are saying you are experiencing definitely qualifies as non-binary.                
Personally, i hate labels. I hate defining what I am. I just want to be my “self”. So even though if I were cis, I would still have a queer sexuality, I only use the non-binary label. I like that it is much more about what I am not, rather than what I am.             
               
Of course, non-binary people have stereotypes, too. Too many people, even within the community, struggle to grasp the full concept of gender and gender roles, and accidentally get sucked into this way of thinking where non-binary is a middle third/other gender in between male and female on the binary, rather than something that exists independently outside the binary. (Its even in the name smh 🤦). So theres a little bit of an androgynous expectation for the gender noobs, ignore that lol, most people here know better, anyway.
                    
Tldr: You sound like you are having social dysphoria, all lgbt labels you think fit you are valid to use, and it sounds like non-binary would fit you. Welcome to the community❤️
“Anytime the term “man” is applied I want to add 15 disclaimers”

That’s how I feel about it, too—and I’m non-binary. It sounds like OP doesn’t feel recognized by and connected to the identity of “man”, at least not strictly. If “non-binary” fits OP better and feels more comfortable to say, absolutely go for it. You can also be a “non-binary man.” There are many of us in the world, from both cis and trans experiences with masculinity. 

Thanks for reaching out to ask this question, OP. As far as I’m concerned, you belong here. This community has room enough for your lived experiences and your GNC self-concept.
Yeh, you also have the option of agender- being without gender.
If you don't want to be seen by society as a man (or woman) but rather as a person, then yeah... I would say so.
It sounds to me like you’re in a conceptual space surrounding your gender and how you relate to it, a lot of enbies experience this before eventually accepting themselves as enby ! 

Give yourself permission in this space to let whatever comes up, come up. Only you can determine how you communicate this truth about yourself and your gender identity or even lack thereof ! I wish you all the best, and know that we are here for you in solidarity, wherever you may land 

💛🤍🖤💜
That's pretty much me too
I could have written exactly this, except I'm AFAB and have a very feminine outer appearance, and I consider myself nonbinary.
Short answer: Yes
Long Answer:
If you feel comfortable with the term ""Non-binary"" and feel like it fits you better than ""man"" or ""woman"" then that's all that really matters. Despite what some people might argue, being nonbinary just means you fit the binary gender roles. It doesn't matter how you look or dress or act, if you're nonbinary you're nonbinary.

Another term you might use or feel more comfortable with is Agender. Which just means you feel like you don't really have a gender at all.


All of that aside BRO I FEEL YOU like can I please just be treated like a person? That would be great thanks 😂
many people hate stereotypes, don’t fit stereotypes, and want to just be treated as individuals. that doesn’t necessarily make someone non-binary. i’m not saying you’re not, i don’t know your experience of course, but it’s an inner felt identity, not an “i’m against binary expectations” conceptualization.
I feel very similar, except that i also want to present myself more androginous, but I think that is mostly because then people will treat me more like a person than a man.. and I feel very comfortable with the label nonbinary. You can also consider agender if that feels better or just don‘t use a label, and express yourself hoe you want, either way, in the current society i feel like we need to make 15 disclaimers anyway..
So I think I have a similar experience to you.   I’ve never understood the concept of gender.  I just do what I want because I want to.  Not because of some inate feeling about a connection to my sex. 

Anyways I now identify as trans-non-binary -agender.  

I am very female presenting and connect with some aspects. People just assume I’m cis-gendered woman.  It’s very difficult to be part of the queer community when I’m constantly being judged for not being queer enough. 

I think it’s really unhealthy to be pushing this idea that people need to physically undergo surgery to be considered a part of. 

Surgery anytime is dangerous. There are always serious risks and permanent.   I should not be made to feel that I have to undergo surgery. In order to fit in.  That’s kinda the whole point. I don’t fit in.  Anyways just my thoughts and experience
I mean you totally could be nonbinary, only you can answer that

That being said, you might also just be gender non-conforming.

 Sometimes people use the term as a stand-in for the term nonbinary,  which works for some folks too, but it essentially just means you don't conform to societal expectations of gender, not *necessarily* that your gender identity itself is not cis/in your case not a man. (Though it could mean that too)

Whatever feels right to you is what's best, f*ck  

society's expectations and f*ck gender roles. 

Good luck!
This is exactly what I think as an AMAB person, but I feel put off from telling people I'm nonbinary because for people, it's so much harder to understand than simply saying I'm a dude. I like female clothes, I like male clothes, I like painting my nails, I like gaming, like these are things that shouldn't be attached to anything but they are, I just don't wanna be limited to one but if I say I'm non binary people are NOT going to understand
I’d say it sounds like you’re experiencing frustration with societal gender norms which anyone can find irritating. It’s not to say you’re not non-binary, but being non-binary is more or less about, and I’m generalizing here, not feeling in line with your assigned gender and feeling either like alittle bit like both binary genders melded together or neither binary gender at all. This is of course broad and heavy influenced by individual experiences but most non-binary folx will experience some dysphoria/discomfort in regards to their assigned gender.
If you're comfy with the non binary label or saying they're your people you are an enby, if not then you don't have to be. there are plenty of folks that aren't men or women that also aren't non binary often considering agender or something instead, there agender andstuff folks that are non binary, non binary men and women etc. gender is just a game, and I'm winning.
Yeah, I think so! I feel almost the same about myself (AFAB with a very feminine appearance). To me, it just seems like you’re gender non-conforming/genderqueer (maybe even agender, like some other people pointed out) and that’s absolutely what falls under the non-binary category. Which is amazing!
No, that’s gender non conforming
Not really, no.
Can fall under this umbrella term yes, really depends on you, if you wanna call it being a man, but a person before it or just being a person without really being a man beside what it looks like
That's just being a feminist
I wouldn't say so. Being nonbinary is a gender identity so there would be a non conforming identity that you feel either dysphoria or euphoria in relation to.

You can just be frustrated by the expectations and not be trans. I'm not saying you aren't for sure, you could be nonbinary or just gnc, and this may be a step to realizing, but this doesn't describe transness to me.

That said, try and come to terms with the fact that many assumptions people make about men are assumptions made for the assumer's safety, not your comfort.
It's definitely nonbinary-adjacent. You can call yourself enby if you like; I think what you describe is enough to count.

Have you heard the term ""apothigender""? It's for somebody who hates gender in general, hates being pigeonholed and stereotyped by gender. It's something that resonates with me, and I have the same sort of reaction to being gendered as you do--""Hey, that doesn't define me; I'm just myself. Stop making assumptions.""

I currently identify as agender, cassgender, apothigender. (Cassgender means not caring about gender, or having it be a really insgnificant factor in life. If gender weren't imposed on me all the time, I truly wouldn't care.)
You are probably GNC! (Gender nonconforming)

If you consider yourself wholly and exclusively a man, you're not non-binary, but you can absolutely be a gender nonconforming man. GNC means that, in one way or another, you don't conform to gender stereotypes. This could mean a non-binary person being masculine or feminine, a woman being masculine, a man being feminine, etc. or just generally rejecting gender stereotypes as a concept. For example, I'm non-binary but I'm also transfeminine and I prefer to look feminine in appearance, so I identify as GNC. You seem more socially nonconforming but that's equally valid! Just remember no matter what, always be yourself!
I’d say it just comes down to what you feel suits you, you can have any personal reason for identifying with a label. Though it can take some time to reflect and also you can leave any label behind if you find it no longer benefits you. There are situations you’ve mentioned that bother you, try finding a way of addressing it just in your mind to allow yourself to move on. You can think, “well, I’m non-binary so it’s not applicable to me” or a thought can be, “well, they just base their opinion on gender stereotypes and there are all kinds of men.” You can start identifying as non-binary in your head and after some time you’ll either feel that it is as far you want to go, or find that you want people around you to recognize it as well, or find you are just comfortable thinking of yourself as cis. I personally find it quite hard sometimes to separate if discomfort I experience caused by sexism or me navigating my complex gender feelings. And to be fair, it’s not always important, what’s important is to be in peace with yourself and strive to make the world a better place which you can do by either being a gender non-conforming man or a non-binary person.
I have been in your situation and thought fuck it non binary is an identity without outer bounds why would anyone want me to proof androgyny or that I'm nonbinary so why would anyone important care if I'm male female or nonbinary.
Anyone can be nonbinary so I say be whoever you want. The only thing that matters is that you feel comfortable with how you define you.
Something that helped me with figuring out my identity was thinking on if I'd be okay with whatever I was assigned at birth.  I do have some dysphoria, but apart from that I am overall okay with the fact that I was assigned female at birth.  But I also know that I'd be happy if I was assigned male at birth.  I think binary people probably don't feel that way.
It's not about qualifications. No one can tell you who you are, you alone are qualified to answer that question. 

Labels are a shortcut we take to describe someone. If the label ""man"" is not a shortcut, but instead creates more work, feel free to reject it.

There are plenty of alternatives available, and you get to chose yours. Take as many as you want, or none at all. They are simply words, they are meant to help us understand each other. Don't let yourself be limited by language.
a person with the experience you described could be nonbinary, or cis, or binary trans — physical dysphoria isn't a requirement for any gender identity, so you absolutely could be trans (binary or nonbinary); or, on the other hand, there are plenty of non-gender-related reasons to hate generalizations and stereotypes (honestly that's just... the correct response to generalizations and stereotypes, from a critical thinking standpoint), so, feeling the way you do, you could absolutely still be cis too. (in regards to how you personally relate (or rather, don't) to gender roles, the label 'gender-nonconforming' or 'GNC' can apply to both cis and trans people.) 

it ultimately comes down to, which feels more correct to describe yourself with? say to yourself ""i am a man""; does that feel correct? now say ""i am a woman""; how about that? now ""i am nonbinary""; how does that feel? 

you can identify with as many of these feel correct to you — for example, i consider myself a nonbinary man — or, if none of these feel correct, you could consider 'agender', meaning you just don't have any kind of gender at all / don't identify with the concept of gender
I think it is up to you whether this makes you non-binary or not. 
A lot of people feel the way you do, and some define themselves as non-binary and some don't define themselves as anything other than what they were assigned at birth. If you feel that the term non-binary or some other genderqueer term fits you and feels good, then you are non-binary. If being non-binary isn't something that feels right for you, then you needn't be non-binary 

Personally, although I understand this feeling to some extent, it isn't what makes *me* non-binary.
To be completely honest, it's difficult to define properly what makes me non-binary.
I suppose it is that I have felt eternally off kilter when it comes to my gender, like a slanted painting. I've been deeply obsessed with androgyny and ""gender bending"" practically since birth (of course the way one presents themselves doesn't necessarily have to do with gender, but for me it does) being put in any gender box for too long feels suffocating, so I define myself as genderfluid instead.

The funny thing is, I think I come off as quite traditional. I'm AFAB, and like a lot of things that would make me come off as house-wifey. I adore feminine things, and the idea of being some sort of stay at home parent doesn't sound unpleasant to me. So I think it would surprise people the way I actually internally see myself, since people generally understand the world through many different learned stereotypes. 


At the end of the day, if defining your gender as anything other than male doesn't serve you, than don't do it. If it does, than go ahead and try out a label, or 8. 
Labeling ones gender is for ones self, not for other people. It is to make you feel good, or more comfortable. 

Also, if you experiment with labels or expression and you turn out fully cis, that is perfectly good and okay. There's a lot of pressure to stay what you defined yourself as yesterday, but we are ever changing animals, and that is good.
As someone who does identify as male: there aren't many *men* who think of their male-ness as ""the spaceship they're piloting"". Most people who identify as men... well, identify as men, and even if some of us like to clarify ""hey, I'm not *that* kind of guy"", it's not really necessary for most of us to throw in a disclaimer (much less more than one).

The desire to be treated as a person and not as a specific gender is also a common nonbinary (specifically agender, as far as I've seen) experience.

&#x200B;

Of course, only you can truly know what gender you are :\]
I think the deciding factor here is whether or not you want to consider yourself nonbinary. Gender identity is a personal thing, and as such it is a matter of what you feel is right to be called.

If when you are alone, calling yourself a man feels right, then you can choose to identify as a man. If, under the same circumstances it feels wrong, then you can decide otherwise. The only thing matters is that the language, and feelings behind that language, feels right for you
That definitely sounds quite non binary to me :) you don’t necessarily have to have dysphoria to be trans or non binary, and dysphoria doesn’t have to be a hatred of your body, it can just be a feeling of not being perceived how you would like, an incongruence with how you feel and your agab.

My partner is nonbinary and they are a man and the definition of an otter. They have a jockish body with a lot of body hair, facial hair, they have a mohawk/mullet hairstyle and they wear masculine clothes (albeit from the 70s) and they’re happy with that. They have no desire to change their body and like how they look now, they just want more muscle tbh haha.

I have another amab nonbinary friend who looks like Eddie from the rocky horror picture show but with a full beard. She is also perfectly comfortable with how they look. They wear a lot of fem clothing but still rock the beard and body hair. He loves not having to worry about what’s man clothes and what’s women clothes, they just put on whatever makes them feel good.

Obviously, there is a chance you might not be non binary, but if you experiment with it and you discover you are cis, the worst case is that you have gained a deeper understanding for a marginalised group who is often misunderstood, and you understand your identity in a better way after. It’s really a win/win.
My AMAB partner feels this way and though he still uses he/him pronouns he identifies more as agender than anything
I'm in the same boat as you and I label myself as nonbinary. Albeit, I did eventually change my name and start using they/them Pronouns, and more gender neutral terminology, but initially that's how it began was just social dysphoria and hating the concept of being a woman.
It depends how you feel about the matter. If you are comfortable with calling yourself nonbinary, then that’s what matters! 

A friend of mine was recently talking in our group chat about how she views the term ‘woman’ and how it applies to some of her social and political views/wishes for the world to be better than it is, and another friend and I were having a hard time explaining to her how wanting to abolish all labels and considering anyone who has to struggle with societal issues generally attributed to women is, to her, a woman and such was actually very invalidating to some people, especially myself who is the only person in our friend group who specifically identifies as transmasc nonbinary.

It was all from a logical standpoint to her, in that she wishes it didn’t have to matter how people feel about their gender because nobody would care and people could just be, but the world isn’t currently like that and likely won’t be in our lifetime. (There’s a very high likelihood that she’s on the spectrum, though she hasn’t been able to get a formal diagnosis at this point, so while what she was saying made sense to her, it inadvertently hurt us.) It also came from a lot of struggling with her own gender identity and issues with stereotypes, and how she’s always identified with many women’s struggles being raised as one, but it’s not exactly how she feels as a person, and etc. It wasn’t an easy conversation, but we eventually settled it for now, and she said it was really affirming when it was suggested that she ‘does not identify with gender.’ Not agender, not gender non-conforming, but not identifying with it at all. (I understand that agender means without gender, but the label itself just wasn’t something that felt right to her and I respect that, similar to the nuances between bi and pan and how I could easily use either to describe myself but the word pan just feels right, whereas the word bi does not for me.)

Point is, if it’s something you’re comfortable calling yourself, then go for it. And you don’t have to listen to society’s stereotypes, I know it can feel hard and like a lot of effort to hear the stereotypes attached to something you feel like and be uncomfortable with it or feel like you have to explain yourself every time, but if it makes you happy and comfortable with yourself, then go with it.
That sounds like how I used to think about womanhood. Like, sure, I'm a girl, but that doesn't mean anything. Turns out I'm not a girl, though, and I'm actually agender. So, in the end, I'd say that the answer is ""maybe"". Disliking stereotypes and stuff doesn't mean that you're nonbinary, or even GNC, it just means that you don't subscribe to restrictive gender norms, which is awesome.  
But when we feel like we need to put a bunch of caveats or disclaimers on our gender, it may indicate that the gender itself doesn't fit us. Maybe you're a free-thinking man. Maybe you don't have a gender, like me. Maybe you're a nonbinary man. Or maybe something entirely else! I can't say for sure, and it's okay if you don't know, either. All of these answers are great answers and are something to be proud of, and exploring and being uncertain of your gender are also great and something to be proud of. (And while uncertainty is often considered a transitory state, it's okay if you're never sure.)
I started out with just only that reason to identify as agender. Though I really related to transfems and quickly kinda started having dysphoria here and there and well… over time became a lot more transfem than I expected. :3
That’s a question you’re going to have to answer for yourself after some research and self reflection. Besides non-binary, you could be gnc (gender-nonconforming) and still identify as a cis man, a demigender such as demiboy, or even agender among many other identities. There’s an unspoken thing among lgbtq+ folks that you shouldn’t tell someone what they are; it’s all up to you to identify what you feel and who you are.
I feel like that's agender but, if you feel like that, then just don't worry about a label at all. If you are able to not care about how you are perceived, you have ultimate power. Take it while you still can.
I've had a very similar experience, I think your labels are a very personal decision and whatever resonates with you
My spouse refers to their sex as the Default setting, as it has no correlation to their identity. We're both agender.
They are non binary if they say they are non-binary. There are literally no other requirements. If that’s what makes you comfy then you should do it!
Mmm there’s a thing called Agender, look into it ( r/agender ). It basically means “I am hooman. I am happy hooman.” and falls under the nonbinary term.
It can, a lot of people would use the label ""agender"" for it, wich means not having a gender. You don't need to use labels, but it does indeed fit into non binary if what your experiencing is not just a ""I'm not a men in the way society says it but I'm a man""
If you want to consider yourself to be nonbinary then do it. it's your life & your labels do what you want.
It depends. If you wanna identify as nonbinary then yes. If not, then no
I think you can somewhat “choose” to be nonbinary. That is, if you believe the desire to be ungendered is something binary people have. I don’t think it is. Especially as strongly as you seen to feel.

You don’t need to fit a certain requirement to do so. I’ve heard some using the label to protest gender roles and stereotypes.
OP, I’m AFAB but your experience sounds exactly like how mine began. I was concerned that I was just “internally misogynistic/didn’t care about gender”, for a while. Then I figured, “well, when people don’t assume my gender or use they/them for me since they can’t see my face, I like that, so I’ll try using they/them pronouns as a whole”, and then I had my first run-in with gender euphoria. I consider myself agender, non-binary, and autigender (has to do with how my autism affects my perception of gender and other social norms). That discomfort with being called “man” may not be being a “feminist” like others said. I waited so long to accept my gender identity because I thought I was just disliking the idea of being a woman because I was misogynistic. I am dysphoric. I discovered this after a long journey!

I am completely open to DM about my experience and listen to yours, or if that makes you uncomfortable we can start a comment chain discussing this. I love talking about my journey and I hope that I may be able to shed some insight into how you do or don’t feel as well. Props to you for asking this question!
I went through a very similar journey until under the influence one day accidentally telling a bunch of people I may be non binary 🤦 I then mentioned it far too many times in private for it to be nothing.

Whilst I initially did stay very masculine presenting (I'm AMAB) as I gave myself the space to explore I really enjoyed things like makeup, painting my nails and some female clothing, and now I am a lot more fluid with how I present in certain circles, infact I only recently realised it was why I liked halloween and cons so much as it gave me a chance to be ""pretty""

Anyway That's a tangent, if you stay masculine presenting your no less valid! We all have our own journey, but I wanted to say I've been where you are not long ago, and just the fact that I had to keep asking this to me was a tell tale sign. Truth be told I'm still racked with doubt about the label at times but imposter syndrome is just part of the human condition!
It depends on the person. I understand why people who hate gender roles may identify as non binary. In my case the reason i call myself non binary is because  i want to look ambiguous even though  technically anyone can be non binary.
I am agender. It literally means no gender and it’s under the non-binary umbrella
I am in search of a label only to understand myself.  I won't be sharing it much or at all, and not at all publicly, once I figure it out.
Ah upon learning of the idea of being nonbinary but still aligned in some way with one's AGAB, I really had many more questions for myself. While I physically present almost as a bit of an extreme version of my assigned gender, I mentally percieve myself as nonconforming in some ways, just about everything of the opposite binary gender and even some parts of my assigned gender feel foreign, but not everything. 

I'm thinking I best fit maybe genderfluid as a label, with the fluidity alternating between my cis AGAB, maybe demigender, to sometimes feeling agender. 
My question is, can someone consider themselves cis and nonbinary, and is this what that is?
Yup this. I am agender
Hey! I’m agender too!
Ye. Ofc no one can make this choice for you, but what you describe fits pretty neatly with the notion of being agender.
Agender being one of the ways you can be non-binary.
OP, this is EXACTLY is how I felt before I realized I had dysphoria and I’m agender
I actually disagree with this. Plenty of people want to be seen as people and not woman/man because they dislike/can't fit in gender norms and stereotypes, it doesn't make them not a woman or a man. It's like saying the gender is the issue when it's all the clichés and expectations attached to it that are a burden.
Now this is what I think I could be too. I'm certain that my gender is more complicated than simply exactly as I was born, but I don't express a lot of nonconformity in practice. It's like I feel a strangely hyperfeminine way yet would still prefer a bound/flat chest, or a more degendered body under that presentation.
>an inner felt identity

The more I've thought about that the last few months the more I realize I have no fucking clue what that means or what my ""inner-felt identity"" is.  Every attempt to find one just ends up back at societal expectations/gender roles or genitals, neither of which is ""gender.""  So agender I am 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️🤔
Actually you are wrong it literally is by definition a person who doesn’t fit gender binary norms. 

Gender is a social construct.  Therefore some people do not experience gender identity.  So some people do not have this internal feeling you talk of. For example being agender means without a gender identity. This is considered non-binary because it is outside the gender norm
I have never understood how some people seem to have a profound connection with their sex. I have male reproductive organs but that is no more meaningful to me than the color of my eyes or my shoe size. Yet no one would ever say that they identify as a person with blue eyes or that they have a meaningful connection with other people with size 11 shoes. And trying to make up stereotypes of people based on other random physical characteristics would seem just as absurd as stereotypes based on AGAB.
Also not true. Non-binary simply means you don’t fit with the binary genders 

I have no gender. I refuse to submit to what society things I should do or say or act like based on my ovaries
Personally I'd say that doesn't fully encompass OP's description, as they not only believe the stereotypes should not exist but also don't fit them. A feminist woman can be feminine and a feminist man can be masculine. It sounds more like OP is a socially androgynous man.
I’m agender and this is how my dysphoria first presented, so I disagree.
I want to express to you that this is how I first felt before realizing I had dysphoria. This is exactly how my first ever step went, and if I didn’t try out they/them pronouns, I’d still be closeted and sad
This is not correct. Non-binary means you do not fit into the gender identity binary.   

Even being labelled trans is just you are a different gender than assigned at birth. 

There is no statement in any definition that says you need to want to physically transform your body.
Same here. I would have ditched the label did people not assume my gender. 
I use it only to counter the assumptions.
Some people don’t even want to use that label, which I mean good for them
There are some nonbinary people who don't use the trans label/identity. There are others who would say they are cis/GNC (gender non-conforming).

To me, the important thing is to figure out how you want to be treated/understood by others, and what helps you feel connected to yourself.
Which one?
Cis women usually want to be seen as women and cis men usually want to be seen as men; it's not about stereotypes it's also about pronouns, how the person is viewed by society, etc.

If someone says they're non-binary then they're non-binary. It's not my place to tell them ""nah you're not!""
you are thinking of gender roles. If you refer to a man as a woman and a she, he will most likely not be too thrilled. Same as if you refer to me as a man I won't like it, though I look as masculine as they come. This is why assuming gender is not cool, nothing to do with what I'm expected to do in a household or whatnot. I'm a person, a they.
We should stop talking about ""inner-felt identity"" as if this was a general experience or somehow relevant to define labels. 

Just as dysphoria, many trans and/or nb folks does not have such feelings. For some of us, it's really just about presentation and transgressing social norms related to gender, and that's totally valid. There is no point in gatekeeping the trans and nb labels: as long and you transgress some gender-norms and want to use such labels to describe yourself, go for it!
it’s not about fitting norms, expectations, or cultural stereotypes and definitions. anyone who is non-binary can look or act any way and still be non-binary.
Gender is what your brain thinks your sex should be, not a social construct. Saying it’s a social construct is harmful to trans people.
This is so so so so me, as someone who’s agender. I’m also autistic which affects my connection to social norms like gender. Anyways I felt EXACTLY like this at first, then as I accepted it I uncovered the dysphoria that was there tbe whole time. I still don’t want to change my body, but I’ve changed my presentation. I hope your gender journey lets you discover an amazing you 💕
I mean, I myself am non-binary and don’t feel like either binary gender myself, but some folx feel that they’re non-binary experience is different than that of my own. I don’t particularly think there’s a “true way” to be non-binary. To be real, if someone says they’re non-binary than that’s what they are regardless of the way they define it. That’s just the label they feel best suits them.
I am agender and don't really know where I fall yet.

My wife has been for far longer but still identifies as cis when asked because her ovaries/vagina and generally feminine presentation will make her seen as a woman by society anyways and she also identifies and is affected by women's political issues.  From a recent thread in r/agender, it seems that many feel similar.
point to where I said they're not trans (and not where I said this is not an exclusively trans experience)

I said EXACTLY the opposite. they might be. but this isn't just a trans people thing. I'm not arguing this shit again it just is something other ppl feel and nothing I said was unreasonable.
where in my comment did I say physical euphoria or dysphoria lmfao

you can be euphoric/dysphoric about a number of things that aren't your body. Please learn to read.

edit: and BEYOND THAT I never said that physical dysphoria inherently means changing your body. Many of my nonbinary friends have physical dysphoria but don't intend to get affirmative medical care.
Agreed. I’m just tired of people calling me ma’am
It’s true. I only use labels to describe myself to others. I don’t think anyone fits in any box
I say I’m both agender and nonbinary because, why not. Since I have no gender, I technically don’t fit into the boxes of man and woman, making me nonbinary too.
I made the same mistake as you did in my comment. Not only cis men want to be seen as men, but trans men as well - that is to say, men want to be seen as men, women as women. Otherwise this sounds a little trans-exclusionary imo
Yeah that’s my point
Also for me it was a lot of not fitting in the norms that led me to realize I was no binary.  I don’t fit into what society genders as a woman.
Gender is partially what your brain thinks your sex should be, hence why so many trans people have brain structures that mirror the opposite sex, that much is true.

But that's not all that gender is. Gender identity can exist in many ways, with or without dysphoria, and is largely defined by society as a means of categorizing  people based on what characteristics it is believed they should share. 

Gender absolutely could be argued to exist on a biological level to a degree, but a large amount of it is just what we are told we should be. That's how people with nonbinary identities, especially those without dysphoria, even exist in the first place.

When people say ""gender is a social construct"" they mean it in the same way that  time is a social construct. Its a very real thing, and it has practical uses, but the way we measure and use it in our society is largely just made up and unimportant.
It literally is a social construct. Sex and gender are two different things. A trans person can legitimately have their brain wired differently.  

Gender identity is what a person identifies as based on their sex characteristics... in that you are correct.  But you are incorrect in assuming that everyone identifies with a gender.  Not everyone does. People who do not fit into the binary. This is how it has been defined.  

Sex and gender are two different things. My sex is female... I have no gender.  And how is this harmful to trans people?  So you are basically saying my existence is harmful to trans people.  So what should I do ? kill myself?  Why cannot different experiences both exsist simultaneously and be different and both be true.  Why do humans get so defensive about others living life different from them?  Just because gender is a social construct doesn't mean its any less valid for people. Most things humans do are social constructs.

Gender has always been defined as a social construct... so presentation.  How you present yourself in the world based on your sex characteristics.  Some people do not present themselves in the world based on their sex characteristics and some do.  Most of the trans that people talk to are binary because if a person is binary and feel that their gender assigned by society is not accurate will go through transformation.

Everyone is different.

But ecology wise animals don't have gender identities. It is only humans.  Just because something is a social construct doesn't make it any less real for some people.

&#x200B;

ALSO, AGENGER PEOPLE ARE TRANS!!! SO TIRED OF HAVING TO DEFEND MYSELF TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE QUEER COMMUNITY.  wHEN IS THE COMMUNITY GOING TO STOP BEING BIGOTS AGAINST AGENDER PEOPLE.  

&#x200B;

You can't expect other people to except other people as you are if you can't except other people in your own community.
Agreed. Also non-binary is an umbrella that encompasses many terms that are quite different. I find a lot of non-binary people have different experiences. They are all valid
Huh? I have a really neutral reply and didn’t call you unreasonable anywhere. I’m really not debating you or calling you unreasonable
The original post said that the person feels dysphoria but didn’t want to change ether body.   You then replied that the person was gender non-conforming and not non-binary because they don’t feel dsyphoria/ euphoria. The person obviously feels dayphoria if they are writing a post on Reddit about it .

I made an assumption based on your response that ignored the persons dsyphoria

But all irrelevant you don’t need to feel these things to be non-binary.  Ever heard of being Agender?

Also that is no where in the definition of non-binary. That you need to
yes. i’m AFAB and the repulse i feel when someone ma’ams me (!!!!!) i just tell people i’m human, they can use whatever pronouns they want on me as long as the intention is not disrespect.
Agender: putting the non in nonbinary :3
you said it’s “a person who doesn’t fit gender binary norms”. non-binary people CAN fit binary norms. there’s no correct way to be non-binary.
and that’s your (very valid) experience. some non-binary people DO fit all the norms associated with “being a woman” but are still non-binary. there’s no one way to be non-binary.
Saying gender is a social construct allows people to dismiss it and deny trans people the life saving affirming medical care we need. As a fellow non binary person, it frustrates me when people confuse this. Gender ROLES are a social construct, but gender itself isn’t. Gender presentation is also a social construct, which is how women can wear suits and men can wear dresses, and still be their respective gender.

Gender is what your brain expects your sex to be. So, as an androgyne, my brain expects a body that is a mixture of male and female. I get distressed and experience incongruence when I realize I don’t have that, since I’m pre-everything.

There isn’t any social aspect to it, even if everyone called me ‘they’ and couldn’t tell what gender I was (which happens fairly often), I still experience incongruence due to the mismatch of my gender and sex. It’s about the physical characteristics themselves.
Gender is not a social construct. Gender and sex are two different things, you are correct. You are also correct about how trans people have their brains wired differently- their brains are wired to expect different sex characteristics than what they might physically have.

Edit: agender people are trans, you are correct. I never said y’all weren’t.
moreover, the OP said they don't like the assumptions made about men and thus them based on the fact that people clock them as a man. There are countless fucking cis men who feel this way. 

I explicitly stated I'm not saying they aren't for certain but that the type of feeling they described isn't an inherently trans one.
do you think agender people don't experience dysphoria or euphoria bc that's not at all what that means
> there’s no correct way to be non-binary

yet you were the one gatekeeping the label by requiring an inner feeling identity. Really, we should keep the general definition that nb is about transgressing gender norm through identity AND/OR presentation. Both ways are valid.
That’s not true. Because the simple fact of being non binary makes a person outside the norms. Because norms is binary in modern western culture
Not true. Being non-binary is being outside the binary. The binary gender system is currently the norm for North America. I’m not speaking to behaviour and presentation.  Non-binary is not the average.  

The only definition of non-binary is outside the binary of gender. You can’t be in the binary and be no -binary.   You can be fluid and change. But if you were afab and you have a gender identity that aligns with that then you are cis 

These are the carergories that society has chosen. I’m not saying any are right or wrong. Just they are what they. Are 

You can identify as a dinosaur but that doesn’t mean you meet the criteria for belonging to that classification.
On the contrary, gender being a social construst should affirm the fact that everyone should be able to define themselves and receive the care they deserve. Insisting that transness or being non-binary is inherently medical and biological is also harmful. Dysphoria is definitely physcial, but you don't have to have it to be non-binary and or trans, and we don't want people to have to convince medical professionals that they are ""biologicaly trans"" in order to get affirming care. That would be more harmful.
No I say gender is a social construct because it’s scientific and true. I’m not going to bend science and lie because it hurts someone’s feelings. 

Just because gender is a social construct doesn’t mean it’s invalid. A person who is trans and gets offended doesn’t know the whole story.  

Every persons identity is unique and personal based on biology and environment… especially during key ages of development.  

Anything that is environment based is a social construct.  Gender is highly influenced by biology so it’s difficult to tease the two out. 

All societal norms and values are a construct. 

Telling an agender person that by not experiencing gender there is something biologically wrong with them is also not okay.  So do we protect binary trans folk or non-binary trans folks. 


I am trans.  And you are telling me that me quoting science and my personal experience is harmful to myself ?
You said you leaned more to the person not being non-binary based on your experience. I shared that yes actually what the person described is pretty close to my experience of being trans so the person may well be. Ultimately only that person knows. 

The difference between gender nonconforming and agender is that a person may not conform to gender standards they still feel that they have a gender identity that matches the gender assigned at birth. 

Agender folks often have similar experiences to gender non-conforming people but they do not feel a connection of identity based on gender that gender non conforming people have.
It seems as though you’re having quite the emotional reaction to what this agender person is telling you about their identity and how it may overlap with OPs, and talking down to them unnecessarily. 

Being agender is conceptualized by some as not experiencing dysphoria or euphoria. I’ve never felt either, until I decided to start GAHT and now people don’t know whether to call me “sir” or “ma’am”. This is the closest I’ve felt to euphoria as an agender person, because I’m being perceived as having an indeterminate or non-existent gender. 

The minuscule dysphoria I experienced was around being perceived as a binary gender. Some agender people experience this and some don’t. From what OP has stated, their experiences sound very much like other NB people’s. 

Whether they ID as trans or not is their business, as some NBs relate, some do not. It’s ultimately about how people communicate a deeper truth about themselves as we cannot fully know their experience. 

I hope you’re able to approach people in the future from a more respectful vantage point and not resort to name calling because they disagree with you, ever so slightly. 

All the best.
being non-binary means identifying/feeling outside the binary. it doesn’t mean you present, act, look, dress, behave a certain way. aka, you can fit binary “norms” (attire, behavior, interests) but identify as non-binary.
According to modern science gender is biological. 

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/02/200205084203.htm 

This article shows suspected biological, genetic proof for being trans. It is not a social construct.

As a non binary person, yes, we have a mutation. There’s nothing wrong with that. I have another mutation where I was born with nine and a half toes. Should I be ashamed of any of my mutations? Are they wrong? No. But at the same time, they are atypical.
I’m sorry that comment op is disagreeing with you, my experience is the same as yours as an agender person btw
can yall please read the original comment where I explicitly say OPs experience isn't inherently a trans perspective but that doesn't mean they arent
also we don't do acceptability politics I can say fuck and have a valid criticism of someone at the same time
Two things : 

1.  Not always.  Agender folks don’t always feel outside the binary. They literally do not sometimes experience gender at all. 

2. I at no point said that a person had to present a certain way. 

What I’m trying to explain to you when I used the term being outside the gender norm I was referring to the gender classification wrong. I think you are misunderstanding me. 

Binary = statistical average = norm. 

Being non-binary in itself places a person outside the norm or average.  

I’m saying being non-binary is outside the norm in itself and not that you have to do or be a certain way to be non-binary.
Can you understand that you’re not the arbiter of what constitutes “inherently trans” ?
It is not that you used a swear, you’re being pedantic. It’s that you’re belittling them and their experience because you want to be right.
i think we just miscommunicated what “norm” means. gender norm = is a social role encompassing a range of behaviors and attitudes that are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for a person based on that person's sex. i don’t think we actually disagree on anything, we’re just talking in circles at this point. i’m signing off, take care!
but it isn't what. that's objective. Cis men share the sentiment the post is based on. you can be cis or trans and think this exact same thing.
No one is disagreeing with you. If the OP feels a loose or no connection to the gender typically assigned to their sex, they can ID as trans or NB and that’s their business. Making statements about what is and isn’t trans is what leads to transmedicalism and hurts all of us. 

It seems like you’re being overly aggressive as a way to prove a point, and it’s wholly unnecessary.
""overly aggressive"" I am not on this planet to be palatable you tone policing weirdo.

What I'm saying isn't transmedicalism, and I've already said very clearly that i have antitransmedicalist beliefs in other comments. you have to accept that not every stipulation for what makes someone trans is medicalized. 

Beyond that, yall keep assuming my beliefs. I haven't been incorrect, you're just mad that I said it in a way that isn't comfortable for you.
Lmao proving my point - name calling with little of actual substance. 

You can “my black friend” your NB friends all you want, scream into the void and be the edge lord of your dreams, but just know, what you said is a razor edge away from basic transmedicalism, whether it makes *Y O U* comfortable to admit it or not. 

The issue isn’t anyone’s anger, it’s that you think there’s a “correct” way to be trans, enby, or generally queer, which invalidates the feelings of OP and most likely some of your friends, as well. 

I wish you all the best, this conversation isn’t going anywhere constructive lmao
holy fuck. I'm nonbinary. Im literally out and all my friends are OTHER trans people. And I never said anything about correct or incorrect queerness. all I said was the sentiment is one cis men also feel and that I wouldn't call OP trans based solely on that sentiment.
And your identity shields you from internalizing transmedicalist beliefs…how ???
You literally assumed I wasn't nonbinary bc I ?? idk did something you didn't like? But I'm the one saying there's correct queerness (which I didn't say and have never believed)?

Beyond that why the fuck would you compare anything I said to black tokenizing that's so weird
I didn’t assume anything about you. You had stated how your enby friends feel about certain things rather than centering your own experience. 

Regardless, being enby doesn’t mean you can’t internalize and twist transmedicalism onto other enbies. Especially ones that are new to the community and questioning. 

You know what I meant, more pedantry. Anyway, you’re clearly in a lot of pain and lashing out. I hope you find a more constructive outlet. 

Peace.
Yeah? my opinion wouldn't mean shit if it wasn't corroborated.

I dont know how you were socialized or assigned gender wise but please stop pulling the shit thats like ""you said something that isn't flat monotone and dispassionate that means ur emotional and blah blah blah you lose bc im empty"" bc that is just misogyny that you've repackaged.

Have the day you deserve lol
Me: *engages thoughtfully and respectfully with your half baked transmedicalist talking points supplemented with misogynistic debate bro vibes* 

You: “YoU’Re a cRYpTo MisoGYnIsT”
>I dont know how you were socialized or assigned gender wise

yeah maybe you shouldnt be giving advice to people who were assigned male if this is how you view gender
why are you putting words in my mouth I said that line is misogynistic and you shouldn't use it😭 you can be dumb instead of malicious. I assumed as much at least.
that part of my comment is to say they've either internalized misogyny or they never deconstructed the misogyny they were taught if they think its appropriate to use that rhetoric. These are two different beasts and whether you were assumed man or assumed woman is going to dictate which you need to solve. I havent checked their page so i genuinely have no idea, nor would I assume their agab had I checked. 

Very simple. Just another example of yall not liking HOW i say something that is accurate. Beyond that, how is you saying to not give advice to amabs not you making the same distinction?
i know what you were trying to say. the issue is you think its worth saying lol. if you think misogyny can be boiled down to ""amab = oppressor afab = oppressed"" you clearly dont have the range to be discussing the gendered experiences of ppl who were amab.
So, you get upset when people criticize your rhetoric for being belittling, condescending, and rude, but it’s inappropriate for someone to make an observation because they might have been assigned a certain gender at birth ? 

Hhhmmmmm really makes you think…
that's straight up not what I said. Being socialized as if you are a man and doing misogyny is inherently different than being socialized as if you were a woman and doing misogyny. They are different. Both misogyny, both equally morally wrong. Different. 

They can't let go of whichever of those it was. I don't care which.

regardless yall genuinely have no idea my opinions about gender and its none of anything yall have said. There's even a name for my belief system. crazy how that goes.
It's not my beliefs that are any of those things, it's how you percieve the way I talk. and I'm not changing that to make YOU comfortable. The fact that you think this makes me upset because of the way I ALWAYS speak is what I'm talking about. I've not acted any differently this entire thread.

I said it's inappropriate for you to use a specific response that's NEVER been not misogynistic. I also never said it's inappropriate to base assumptions off agab. THEY did. and then they did the same thing to me. I was calling out hypocrisy.

edit: I also wasn't even being bioessentialist like they assumed I was talking specifically about socialization as in what you're taught to say and do😭
okay so how are they different
You literally say these things and when people take what you said to it’s intended conclusion you immediately backpedal with a flimsy “that’s not even what I said” 

…it literally was ? Cowardly af
Oh, so because you’re always this unpleasant that makes it okay lmao

Point taken
perspective. Dk what else you expected.
to YOU. unpleasant TO YOU.

respectfully, I repulse EXACTLY the people who I do not want to like me. And reddit ""lefty"" liberals are part of that group.
what is the perspective that all people who were amab have on misogyny and how is it different from the perspective that all people who were afab have
Hhmmm fairly certain I’m not the only one lmaooooo

You’re soooo edgy we’re alll sooooo impressed at how obviously not upset you are lmaoooo
now why do you think I speak in absolutes and not generalizations? That was a YOU addition.

Afabs learn an internalized, self-diminutive misogyny first. Amabs learn the externalized, othering version first. two sides, same coin. As you age it evens out obviously, but early childhood socialization is going to be harder to shake bc its been there so long.

This isn't to say (transfeminine especially) amabs don't experience internalized misogyny. It also isn't to say (transmasculine especially) afabs don't participate in externalized misogyny. that's just not what they were told to feel and do, beyond the implications of misogyny itself.
*makes absolutist generalizations about how all genders interact with misogyny* 

“WhY do YoU tHiNK I spEAk in AbsoLuteS ?”
Don’t you think it’s a little shortsighted to categorize the experiences of people who are literally defined by not being the gender they’re told to be based on what other people told them they should do? Most trans/nb ppl have gnc feelings from a very young age. I don’t think it’s that hard to imagine a trans girl taking the misogyny she hears personally, or a trans boy using misogyny as a way to differentiate himself from girls.
""men suck"" - generalization
""EVERY man sucks"" - absolutism

""amabs and afabs have different perspectives on misogyny"" - generalization
""amabs all do misogyny the same and afabs all do misogyny the same"" - absolutism

all is typically a pretty key word

Regardless, yall are arguing with a strawman. I don't think what you think I do and yall aren't going to suddenly make some salient point that will make me abandon my beliefs.

Enjoy your night. Maybe smoke a joint. It'll help... whatever it is that's going on.
Also, some people know they’re neither of the binary genders, and have a unique experience of misogyny outside of what the binary genders experience, with its own deconstructions and manifestations later in life. 

It’s reductive to believe that all genders experience and internalize oppressive systems the same way, because everyone, cis trans or otherwise has a unique experience of misogyny. 

Dragging someone’s AGAB into the conversation is doubly unnecessary and doubly regressive.
See, you’re avoiding answering the question in good faith because you don’t like how it’s being asked, and then calling everyone else a hypocrite, because they just don’t like you. Quite rich. 

If you take issue with misogyny, why does anyone’s AGAB factor into it ? It shows where your head is, and belies a maliciousness that is thinly veiled. 

I hope whatever is going on with you, you can find peace within yourself and stop dragging others for no good reason ahaha 

Enjoy your smoke :)
yeah i didn’t want to use a binary example considering the sub we’re in but it was the easiest way to get my point across. it’s bizarre to think you can assume an individual’s experience with gender just based on the one they were assigned.

When I finally go to my nurse practitioner she agrees that its time to remove it, then I see my actual OB and shes like nope cant remove a ""healthy"" organ and you dont have someone to babysit you for 6 weeks so just go off your bc and be in excruciating pain for a week and start it back up again since your ""system"" needs to ""reset""

So after a week of extreme pain it worked, until 2 months later when I'm bleeding nonstop again, so I'm just doing the ""system reset"" thing on my own cuz I'm tired of being told theres no issue when there clearly is

Oh and we're about 90% sure I have endometriosis but my ob doesnt want to check for whatever reason??? So theres that too... And who knows whats actually going on with my ovaries, just take them out already please I dont want anymore kids (I had two kids before I knew I was NB) and all they do is cause pain, so GET RID OF THEM
I'm 18 weeks pregnant. I've always wanted to get pregnant and have kids but I realized I was gender queer a few years ago. Most of the time it's fine I'm happy and excited but there are days I wish I could just set my uterus and boobs on a shelf for a minute and not deal with it. It's tough! I can't sleep cuz of my growing belly and my hormones make me cry all the time. Plus my average sized boobs feel huge and I'm always worried about them leaking. I'm excited to meet our daughter but some days I wish she would just come out haha.
yepp. I have dysphoria of nearly all female biological features of mine.
I have endometriosis and had a total hysterectomy before I understood that I was non-binary. But I remember discussing the decision with other people who’d had hysterectomies and they talked about all this sadness and grief about losing their uterus and how it made them feel like “less of a woman.” And I did not understand these feelings *at all.* I was so delighted to have my uterus gone. I thought it was because it had caused me problems for half my life. And that was certainly a factor, but I know now it was at least a bit of dysphoria. 

Also, I wanted to be a mom my whole life. And I wanted to be pregnant my whole life. Then I actually got pregnant and carried to term and I *hated* being pregnant. I hated sharing my body. I hated feeling my baby inside me (most of time time. Sometimes it was ok.) and I was devastated that I hated it so much. I always thought I’d love being pregnant. But now I know I was dysphoric the entire time. So, if you already know you don’t want to be pregnant, I definitely suggest hysterectomy.
Yes! I hate having one. All it does is cause me pain and stress. I really want a hysterectomy.
Yes 😐 it did it’s work because I gave birth to two kids but now I want it gone for good. No need for that lump of flesh anymore
Not really but i would love to yeet my tiddies
Ever since I was little I've hated the thought of being pregnant. I didn't want to touch my mom's belly when she was pregnant, and the very thought of it made me cringe internally before I knew what that meant. I was brought up conservative christian and the whole culture was focused on how eventually I would grow up to have babies, and I felt so much physical and social dysphoria from a young age. I was terrified of becoming a 'woman' and being forced to 'carry' things inside of me.
Even now, I can stand being called girl, femme, female, but NEVER woman, lady, etc. The baggage associated with those latter titles feel centered around female reproductive organs.
yes
Yes but I don't have bottom dysphoria I'm confused
I hated my system just because of the possibility of pregnancy. My NP was all for me getting my tubes removed but it took some coaxing to get the surgeon to agree. Finally got my tubes removed in December, and they found a large cyst on an ovary so they dealt with that. (I most likely have PCOS). But when I joked about removing the whole uterus (“joked”) my surgeon was like “no, not unless you absolutely need to.”

I guess because my uterus is healthy and it would put me into early menopause it’s a no go. But I wish they would have just removed the whole kit and kaboodle. 

At least now I can get off birth control and don’t have to worry about ever being pregnant. Such a relief!!
Yes
Yep constantly. But my sister had a good point about the government not wanting people with chronic illnesses and disabilities to breed, so I could probably play up my disability to get a hysterectomy
Not that much since I'm on the pill and I don't menstruate anymore.
But I still have that fear of getting pregnant 💀💀
Yes! Especially when it makes itself known. I also have recently struggled with I would love to be a parent but I think being pregnant would be a mental battle with dysphoria I couldn’t win.
Yes. I hate knowing it’s there. I have no plans to reproduce and every period is just a reminder that I possess a biological function I should not. 

Some day I’ll get it removed.
I didn't have dysphoria over it, but I thought it was really fucking annoying so I got it yanked last year. I woulda done the same thing if I was a cis woman though.
Yeah. I'll have a sterilization someday :)
Yes. I definitely want to remove it. I don't have periods - my hormones are low but the doctors ruled out genetic causes and other causes - so my dysphoria comes from having it rather than having periods themselves. My doctor wanted me to start estrogen and progesterone which I didn't want and said that I didn't want. I'd keep my ovaries for hormone production and remove my uterus.
Yes
Yes my first periods I felt so freaking upset and didn't understand it was dysphoria until much later in life
Oh yes, I want it gone. It causes me not only dysphoria but a lot of physical pain as well. I get random really bad cramps even though I don’t have my period anymore. I’ve gone to multiple doctors about it at they don’t know what it is. These cramps come in timed intervals which is really weird to me
Yes, but more in a “I’m terrified of getting pregnant” way, like being reminded that I can get pregnant makes me so uncomfortable in my body
Yes very badly. Unfortunately, I live in an area where no doctors are willing to do it and insurance won't cover it(?) so I'm fucked. It's depressing and adds up to everything else going on in my life. Trans affirming healthcare is a human right >!but we are not seen as human..not in my neck of the woods.!<
Yes for so many years. It skeeves me out having one, has put me into panic attacks, every month having my menstrual cycle is very dysphoric. The thought of physically having my own children terrifies me. I have desperately wanted it out for years. I consider my uterus to be my personal terrorist.
Just the uterus not so much, because I don’t really think about my internal organs, as my ADHD makes me forget about even having uterus (I really scared myself few times in my life seeing blood while peeing, being sure I’m dying xD), but since I started having hormonal issues that caused a bit of weight gain and my chest to get bigger, oof. I was always very androgynous and still am, but just seeing my chest swelling because of my uterus bullshit makes me very uncomfortable :<
Yes every time i have my cycle and sometimes when im just feeling dysphoric in general. I really want to ripe it out but ik i cant do that lol.
As an asexual and a nonbinary person, absofuckinglutlely. It’s a little better now that I’m on birth control, and don’t suffer from extreme cramps as much anymore, but I still hate the fact that it’s there. I made a joke once about how I’d like it gone all together to my doctor, and the reply was “I’m too young, I might change my mind. It’ll cause more problems to remove it.” I get that I’ve only realized I’m nonbinary for less than a year, but I’ve never wanted sex or to be pregnant. But she won’t even consider my request for getting my tubes tied. It’s so frustrating.

Edit to add: I’m 24 so I’ve legally been an adult for 6 years, but I’m still “too young”
I have the opposite, but yes.   
AMAB, yet I feel like I'd be better off without it and be more euphoric or happier without it. I occasionally get that brainwave of dysphoria, also because I wear femme underwear and it sticks out frequently. Yet to know any way how to stop that from occurring. 

But yes. TLDR, I too have the same feeling to remove the dysphoria, but (at least for me) insurance wouldn't support it and there's half a dozen different infections and other high risks associated with it. It is very upsetting to have it and feel like less of myself, but yet, I'll keep goin. Shit sucks, to be honest. I wish you luck, dear reader, though. <3
Dear **GOD** yes, I fucking hate it. It's the source of pretty much all of my dysphoria.
i would do anything to have my boobs and uterus removed. i wouldn’t even mind having a Ken-doll crotch. i don’t want to have any gendered body parts at all
Yup. Can’t deal with the fact I have one and that it makes it’s presence known so damn often
more so my ability to have children and that i get my period. im planning a tube removal in 2 years when my IUD is toast. my OBGYN was very affirming of that decision and will put in a new IUD so i continue to barely get my period if at all. but i get what you mean!
I struggle to define how and if dysphoria affects me. Looking of the definition sounds like depression and my general state of being 24/7. I've never liked who I was or what I've looked like in any context. My period is something I've ignored my whole life except when absolutely necessary. I have this strange repulsion to taking birth control but I need to because my uterus is broken.
Yes! Since I was like 22-23 I thought about getting a hysterectomy.
Honestly, no. Its just more annoying than anything, but I would like to have children one day. Actually being pregnant scares me, and I hate the way society treats pregnancy and pregnant people. Despite that I do think I would like to get pregnant one day. Adopting is also something I would strongly consider.
I get dysphoria whenever I have my period or with childbirth or getting pregnant and having kids of my own. Also I still have my brests and really wanna either remove them or get them smaller and wear binders more easily
Bleeding every month made me absolutely miserable. I'm just shy of six months post-hysterectomy and it was the BEST decision I've ever made for myself, I have significantly less dysphoria not having to deal with periods.
No longer have one: yup it caused major dysphoria. (Mine was defective, bled more than not and hurt. Removed via other medical track not gender affirming track that just ended up as a nice bonus)
Absolutely I will have the surgery as soon as I can
Not dysphoria necessarily but discomfort. I’m nonbinary & a s//x repulsed ace who doesn’t want children. I.. don’t really have a use for it 😅
Yeah, I opted to just get sterilized. Hoped I could just get rid of general issues if I didn't have fallopian tubes and got my uterus cauterized then maybe dysphoria would go away. Which has caused an issue due to the surgeon. I may just have to get my uterus removed if I cannot get it fixed. I don't want to. I don't want to have to be forced to rely on pelvic floor therapy to not have prolapse. 

There's an option where they keep the cervix intact which I believe helps with this? But I don't want to have to deal with it. I haven't decided anything, but my periods, though I don't really bleed anymore, are excruciating. I read about the issue I'm having and know why it's a problem, but I won't bore anyone with details. Apparently I have really bad labor pains every month now and not just normal cramping.

Anyway, if you're thinking about any of this make sure you do research. Know what can become a problem. I can find what my current issue is called if anyone wants to read about it.
i wouldn’t get dysphoric about it if i didn’t bleed for actual months at a time. i bleed for about two weeks on average every month (tho it varies a LOT) but for the entire 2022 summer (june-september) i bled heavily. my doctor says my period hasn’t regulated itself yet. i say it’s been five years HOW has it not regulated itself yet. i’ve tried lots of birth control. pills gave me debilitating cramps (i was immobile before the pills so imagine how much worse those got), patches amped up my depression, etc. im banking on finding a doctor who will actually listen to me and allow me to get it out
All the time. I don’t get much dysphoria about my body besides it but I absolutely hate having one. It’s the only surgery I’m certain I want at this point, but I don’t know what my odds are of getting it
YES OMG I want to get a hysterectomy so bad but I know they’ll try to get me to do some form of birth control first even though I have bad experiences with them in the past plus it’s incredibly dysphoric for me
I have an appointment with a surgeon at the end of this month!! So excited. Already have 1 letter of recommendation. Still waiting on my second! Birth control absolutely destroyed my mental health.
Yes! I have been trying to get a hysterectomy for 15 years and doctors keep denying it for various reasons. I had hoped that being over 40 they would respect that I know what I want, but they don't. I was hoping that since I have medical issues that would be resolved with the surgery they would understand, they don't.
I just hate having a period and plan to see what I can do to make that stop happening whether that’s low-dose t or a surgery of some kind
Ever since the overturning of Roe V Wade I WANT that fucker out of me. Also periods seem pointless because I'm childfree.
For anyone looking for resources or who has gotten a hysto with a trans and/or non-binary friendly doctor, r/ftmhysto is working on a doctor's list. It's for ftx as well
I hate my uterus and my ability to get pregnant. Getting my tubes tied for birth control as well as gender affirmation.
Yes! I’ve never wanted children. I’ve always resented my periods and I fantasize about getting a hysterectomy but I feel like I’m being selfish? Well not selfish but I don’t have painful periods or any chronic diseases and I feel like I’ll be turned away because my reasons are frivolous. 
I really want to donate my uterus to someone who actually wants one though. Not sure if that’s even possible.
Yes, I'm going to remove the entire thing
yes bc i am deathly afraid of getting pregnant
I do, it is one of my biggest dysphorias. I hate my uterus. Not like I necessarily want a penis, I just don't want a uterus. I don't want period cramps, and i don't want bleeding for a full week, but I also don't want those freaking hormones as an alternative....
I want to get a full hysterectomy, but I'm so young I don't think anyone would do it :(
I do not because I just imagine an empty cavern in my guts. My periods don’t cause me dysphoria but suck butt. I’m considering an endometrial ablation to stop them. For me a hysto is too intense for me right now. Six months out from top surgery and still healing up!
Having my uterus, cervix, and tubes removed was a huge relief from dysphoria for me
I get pretty bad dysphoria from having periods not just pms but during the period. I also think I have pmdd - last time I was in the er (alcohol related) guess what started that VERY day? Yup. I've tried birth control and it doesn't stop my periods even though I specifically got the kind without a placebo pill every week. Sucks.
Yup, it's my primary cause of dysphoria I think
I’ve hated my uterus since the first time it betrayed me with blood. I have wished for it to magically vanish every day since then and that was like 20 years ago. 

Then last year I realized why - I’m actually trans.

I’ll definitely be getting top surgery & a hysto as soon as I can manage it.
It was never mine and it has been removed yes. Tumor that could get parasite inside. Bleeding without wound. Hysterectomy was the most important part of my transitioning.
I think I’m fine with the organ itself and all of my other female organs (im usually okay with my boobs but sometimes I want to yeet them) but like periods and stuff make me really dysphoric
Yes. No bottom dysphoria but plenty for the internal reproductive system. Trying to get my tubes removed at the very least.
Yesss! Idk if i identify as NB, however i have so so so much reproductive dysphoria! The fact i could potentially become pregnant and have my body invaded by a fetus if the worst thing that i could possibly think to happen to me. I wanna keep the vag and the ovaries though, and i havent pursued a partial hysto yet bc 
1) i feel like bc I’m fairly sex-conforming/ i dont necessarily id as NB/ I’m a woman all the drs will just push me off/not listen/ try and put me on bc or
2) my ovaries will fail after hysto and i will be thrown into menopause violently and wayy too early
Pregnancy scare gave me such bad dysphoria I gave up PnV until I could get permanent birth control.
I’ve often wondered if my feelings on this are due to tokophobia or some kind of dysphoria. I mostly only have “social dysphoria”. I’m okay with most of my body. But uterus? NO THANKS.
Yes I do. I actually unfortunately somehow managed to get pregnant while on birth control and its one of the worst things to ever happen to me. I enjoy having a vagina but I dont like that my body can make a child its creepy I dont like it I want my tubes tied. ;-;
Yes, but it’s usually out of sight; out of mind for me so it’s mostly only on my period, which is when my dysphoria is usually at its worst, like, I want to rip all my skin off and cry all the time type of worst, so that could be part of it too.            
                 
I just started birth control (the cervix ring one), for other medical reasons, so I’m hoping that helps since I can choose to just not get mine now. It really sucks that one can’t just go and get it taken out on “no reason” 🙄
I am in recovery from my emergency hysterectomy as we speak. I actually became awash with wild gender euphoria when I came out of surgery that was totally unexpected. But I’ve always had dysphoria over it in general so I shouldn’t be quite so shocked, lol. 

Every period (so impossibly fuckin painful) would spiral me out. Between the pain and the yick from my own body that for years I never had a word for… yeah. So when I was in the ER a week ago and they were like “so this ovarian cyst takes up your whole abdominal cavity and your gallbladder no longer works and we need to take it out first…” I was like. Listen. Take the whole thing. I am never going to use it. I am almost 35. I am disabled. I am never having kids. My periods are so so painful that my PCP suspects endo. I have extreme trauma from rape and do not have sex, and I’m asexual. I do not need these parts please take them all I can’t take it anymore.” And the oncologic obgyn was like. “Yeah, you don’t need those but let’s keep the other ovary if it’s clean so you don’t need HRT” and I about died of shock and she changed my surgery to full hyst from oover-something-tomy. 

Because it was emergency surgery (I was in really bad shape and had some vomiting issues), my recovery is going to be longer than usual. So far it’s been a week and I’m only just going home in the morning. I’ll have PT for a long while. But man, it’s worth it. 

It’s so worth it. At least on my end. No more periods. No more period products. No more not being able to afford products. No more feeling tied to a gender that I’m not. 

Additionally, the whole thing had done a lot of damage to my insides, that bad ovary. Over 22cm long and over 10lbs in weight … not including the weight of the liquid… it was one of the largest ovaries the general surgeon (who assisted and took my gallbladder in the same go) had ever seen. And she frequently works as a team with the onc obgyn that was lead on my surgery. 

I lost several inches in my stomach even with the post surgical swelly-belly. My muscles have no idea what to do about it. So my recovery will be longer than most people. It can be a same-day send home if it’s not complicated like mine.
Yes. Just yes.
I did and I got it out!!! 6.5 months ago and never felt better. I also had endo and adenomyosis so win/win:)
I get more dysphoria from “all that” than my chest
I wouldn't say I get dysphoria over it, but defiantly will consider removing it one day.  I do not want kids ever having or any other means.  The mer thought of me being pregnant make me ill (now me being pregnant would definitely make me dysphoric as fuck).  My uterus to me is useless I do not need it, and may definitely get rid of it one day.
My uterus is the only thing I truly hate in my body, I don't even mind periods or my weirdly shaped boobs that might be tubular, but the baggage that comes with a uterus is what destroys my mind every once in a while, why does a thing I'll never use have so much say in what I am? What I could be? I've never, never related to motherhood, or anything even close to it, yet I'm reduced to that for my whole life, I say I don't want kids, people say I'll change my mind, I worry that soon people will start to ask me and my (amab) partner if we're having kids and I'm NOT ready for that. Anytime femininity is mentioned, pregnancy and motherhood are mentioned with it as if they were synonymous, as if it were the most pivotal part of being a woman? 
This is maybe the reason I could never call myself a woman or wife (for some reason wife makes me feel really dysphoric but not girlfriend?), I don't want to imagine being any of that.
Maybe it's because I have such a visceral reaction to even being close to the concept of mother, that I could never be myself if I were to get pregnant, that no matter what I'd be ID'd as ""woman"" for the rest of my life, that I'd be expected to be a certain way, act, dress, have no interests, be stuck in my terrible hometown, seeing my grandmother's example also doesn't help, so no, I don't like to think about my uterus, or I start to spiral.
I've been seeing more nonbinary parents out there being proudly out with their kids and I love to see that, but by god any parenthood just isn't for me, besides have you seen that girl with the list of reasons not to get pregnant? it's huge!!
I wouldn't exactly call it dysphoria most of the time. I mostly am just really scared about getting pregnant and don't believe the risk of childbirth is actually worth it just to get a kid, especially since I could just ask my future girlfriend to do it (if she wants), however, when I am on my period I get an overwhelming feeling, similar to the dysphoria I get around my breasts, so I might get dysphoria around my period but I don't think I experience any level of dysphoria around my uterus itself.
Idk, I don’t really think about it. Like I don’t actively want to have one but I also don’t want more (expensive) surgeries than I have to have. Helps that I can’t see it!
🙋‍♂️
I did and I did. I had medical reasons that made it an option, but I realized in retrospect that it was also gender affirming for me.
As a witch. Earth worker. Living by my cycle. 
No. 
I understand that. But it is a vital organ for our health. I have one too and I embrace it and thank it for keeping me vital and healthy everyday. I hope you will find the peace to do so too. 
I know many will prob hate my comment. 
But I just want you to know that uterus or male organs, non binary people are still non binary. 
I really hope that you will be able to accept and love your reproductive organs just as any other part of you. Gender confirmation surgery all aside, can be maybe a good thing for a persons peace. But in the end it will be harder to feel pleasure and to feel healthy. I would highly re-consider doing a surgery to remove it completely. 

I hope that I have not offended too many but I understand if I have. Please answer with some form of calm and understanding if you feel like I am being disrespectful.
Yes and yes
Constantly. It's why I've stopped taking the placebo pills. Having a period reminds me I have this gross organ...
It’s important to distinguish between hating it because periods and childbirth objectively suck and feeling dysphoria because it doesn’t align with how you see yourself. A lot of people here seem confused
Had mine 6 weeks ago.  The first two weeks suck but 6 weeks out I'm pretty much back to normal.
Same, depending on insurance.
Unsolicited advice warning. Feel free to ignore. This 100% sounds like endo as someone who’s had it since I was a teen. Technically endo cannot be diagnosed without surgery which is why a lot of doctors will not investigate it. A hysterectomy will not cure endo, but if you want it out anyway, it’s a great time to check for endo. Sounds like you need another GYN who’s willing to actually respect their patients’ autonomy. If you want to chat about endo feel free to dm me.
Need to go to an endo specialist. They are more equip to do surgeries (correctly) and you can talk to the about hysterectomy.
Similar situation here, I got an IUD which helps a bit (hell at first) but also most likely endo and they don't wanna check for it. So frustrating
I don't really have bottom dysphoria either, at least not for the parts on the outside of my body, only for my uterus.
I also have no bottom dysphoria
Same! I actually love having a vagina but hate the uterus
Fun fact if you keep your ovaries (where the hormones are made) you will not go into menopause!!
Surprisingly my chronic and debilitating disabilities were less important of a point than my debilitatingly painful periods, so this is going to vary by obgyn. I think the experience I had is the one EVERYONE should have.
Hacing exactly the same thoughts about it
Me too, I get it. My insurance doesn't cover gender-affirming healthcare on ""religious grounds."" The dysphoria I have from not being able to get the healthcare I need to be my happiest self is hard to bear. I think we live in similar necks of the woods unfortunately, everything is falling apart around here. Everyone's rights are getting taken away, except for the people's who want to harm others. We are going backwards progress wise and I don't know whether to maintain hope that it will get better eventually or give up and move somewhere else.
Ugh that does sound frustrating. Your doctor should listen to you about what would be best for your happiness. The whole ""you'll change your mind"" thing is super annoying! And btw I'm asexual too, and aro. These organs are useless to me and just a huge pain besides my ovaries to make hormones.
Hey same here, except for I do have dysphoria and I'm aro as well as ace.  :)
I've actually been doing a lot of research the last few months on hysterectomies! If you are curious check out r/hysterectomy, it is so informative and supportive! From what I heard about pelvic floor therapy it is a temporary thing, not a life long thing. If I were you I'd definitely want a hysterectomy, but you do what's best for you. 🤗 🧡 Good luck!
I'm so happy for you! My insurance doesn't cover gender-affirming surgeries so I have to convince them it's medically necessary. 🤷
I'm childfree too!
I'm not sure if it's possible to donate your uterus either, but it is definitely NOT selfish to want that thing out of you! Even if you don't have really bad cramps or excessive bleeding or anything like that, having dysphoria over it or just not liking it or needing it in general are perfectly valid reasons! It is possible you'll be turned away, many people are because doctors don't always take those afab seriously. But keep going, keep trying, until you find one that will take you seriously. If you know this is really what you want and you know the risks, never give up! Someone will listen to you eventually. I recommend the doctors list on r/childfree as a starting place for more open minded doctors. Good luck!
Aww, I'm sorry. I'm young too so it will be hard to find a doctor who will take me seriously. But if you do it for dysphoria or a medical reason that increases your chances. I've been looking at the doctors list on r/childfree lately and that has been very helpful. It is a list of doctors who are more open minded about this kind of stuff all over the US. I suggest you take a look at it (if you live in the US, I'm not sure if they have a list for other places or not)!
I see! I have a question, how do you know your ovaries will fail? It is possible for it to happen after a hysterectomy but not guaranteed. If they did fail you could take hrt, unless you have cancer I think.
I appreciate you looking out for others well being, and I am happy for you that you have found peace with your body. I know that I am still nonbinary with these organs, thanks for the reminder. I would keep my ovaries to continue producing hormones so I would be as healthy as possible. For some of us our uterus makes us less healthy and less happy, and impacts our lives negatively. It can be because of a medical condition or dysphoria. Some people only feel like their bodies match how they feel inside after a gender affirming surgery like this. It is a major surgery, and it is definitely a good idea to research it before making up your mind. I have done this and have been thinking about it for years. It is a personal choice, for some people it would be worth it and for others not. For me though and many people who have commented on this post, it would be worth it.
I love hearing positive stories! I have endo and OCD so I’m hoping to end my hormones’ reign of terror as well.
I wish you the best of luck. Mine is dependent on NHS waiting times. Great for the wallet, not so great for literally anything else.
At this point I'm just waiting for 5 more years and then I'm going to demand these organs get removed, I turn 30 in 2 months, at 35 is when they consider taking out the organs since its ""no longer needed for your health"" or so I've been told

I guess these stupid organs causing my dysphoria make my brain and bones healthy? In which case their still doing a crap job cuz I have arthritis that gets worse as the years pass and super bad depression and anxiety, which is also caused by my dysphoria, so its like a full circle of FU you know?

The OB's all belong to the same company here in my state, or all the ones I can find near me. So their all going to have the same opinion since they work off that same company. ""Womans"" health is just a joke tbh

But thank you, I'm hoping we can eventually get this sorted out but if I can wait 5 years maybe I can just get the hysto and be done.
Not to bash on your country too much, but god, I’m so so sorry for you to have to have surgery to get endo diagnosis 💔 I had it diagnosed end of last year at basic gyno exam (because well my uterus muscle have holes in it so like hard to miss it xD ). But this is such a bullshit, and with the whole yOu mAy NeEd It it’s even more infuriating 🫠.
I had one, it made the pain less not gone, and then I was on the pill and IUD, so we decided to remove the IUD when the pill worked. The pill does take away the pain, until I'm bleeding nonstop and have to ""force a reset"" forcing myself to be dysphoric for another week with pain so I'm not in pain... Its so stupid.. I'm just so done
Yes that is another note, I asked them to take my ovaries at least and was told no because of that. 😓
I live in the UK. Breeding is more important than pain, trans people are the enemy to distract from the fact that Tories are the cause of the country's problems, and all people born female will ""change their minds and want children so just wait""
It’s so wonderful to meet another nonbinary ace! And it is very frustrating, and I don’t know how much is US law/regulations and how much is “maybe I should get a new doctor”.
I’m also aro!! Greetings fellow aroace 😌
Wow, I'm so glad it's only temporary lol. I never actually looked too much into it cause I've been so busy but I had thought it was forever and I was dreading making a decision. Thank you! I'll definitely have to check out that subreddit and do my own research once my class is over
Thank you so much for your thoughtful comment! I've never looked at it that way!
I've definitely kept an eye on the list! But I also don't have a place to heal after the procedure. My parents don't want me to get it and I still live with them
I don’t know that they would fail. It’s just something that doctors have brought up and it’s something that I’m extremely afraid of because I very much don’t want to be on HRT before I have to be (I probably will be after I hit menopause) I don’t want to have to deal with more medication stuff that I’m already taking for my brain to work properly
I totally respect your decision. I am also glad that you have looked up the pros and cons for it. I also hope you are making a decision that will make you happy in the long run!

My sister sent me this post surgery and I nearly popped and stitch I laughed so hard
I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. It truly sucks. I know this isn’t the solution for everyone, but I was finally able to get my ovaries out 2 years after my hysto, just about a month ago, because I’m on low dose testosterone. My GYN was fine with taking out the uterus because I didn’t need it because I knew I wasn’t getting pregnant again. But she made me keep the ovaries because it isn’t great for your bone health to do menopause too soon. But once I started T, she said it was fine to have them out. And I needed to anyway because they were covered in endo. 

It sucks so much that doctors put reproductive function over everything else. Like you’re not gonna use any of these organs and there are treatments that can keep you healthy without them (estrogen and progestin work too if T isn’t your thing), but they’d rather have you keep diseased organs that ruin your mental health than remove them. It’s the fucking worst.
I'm pretty up to date on the research on endo (I'm a health writer and I read medical journals pretty often) and laparoscopic surgery is still the gold standard for diagnosis. Obviously, some people have disease that can be detected with imaging or on a pelvic exam, but for the vast majority of people, endo will not show up definitively on imaging or be noticed during a pelvic exam even by an expert. This has nothing to do with being in the US. Though, our healthcare system does absolutely suck and it's bullshit. But worldwide, surgery is still the diagnostic gold standard for endo.
After reading all of your comments about your OB, please, my love, find someone new. Check over at r/childfree — they have a constantly-updated wiki of doctors that *will* sterilize you if that's what you want. And even if that isn't the route you go, you'll at least know you have a good doctor on your side from now on.

As someone who had their hysterectomy back in November thanks to that wiki, I highly recommend it.
You could ask them to take 1, which I know a lot of trans people do in case they lose access to T
Y’all are roughly around the same bs as the US with it being harder to change your doctors and I’m maybe super mad about it for you.
It is very nice to meet you too! I'm not aware of any laws or regulations that would prevent you from being allowed to do this, but I'm no lawyer. I would probably get a new doctor.
Greetings! 🤗💚💜
So glad I could help! Also I plan on having my uterus, tubes, and cervix removed. I want my cervix removed to eliminate the risk of cancer, avoid mini periods, and not have to have any pap smears! Some people keep theirs though, it is a personal choice.
No problem! I want us all to get what we need to be our happiest selves. 💗
I still live with my parents too. I don't have enough money to afford my own place yet. I've talked to my dad about it and he is nervous but supportive. I haven't talked to my mom about it yet but plan to in the next few days. She will be tougher to convince. I am still on their insurance plan which unfortunately has ""religious exemptions"" for gender affirming surgeries, so I have to convince the insurance company it is medically necessary. 

I'm sorry your parents aren't being as supportive of you as they should be, that really sucks. I wish I could talk some sense into them for you!
👍
I am so, so grateful that this isn't really something I encounter any more because this video had me alternating between cackling and just... blind horror.
Omg that was actually hilarious lmaooooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
My state is a red state and has been one of the top states to push the anti-affirming trans care crap recently. Without saying which one since theres plenty now to choose from sadly.... So getting on T just to have my uterus removed is still not going to happen most likely

Theres also the whole ""excuse"" my OB gave which was primarily that I didnt have a support system for the ENTIRE 6 weeks of recovery. WELL THEN GIVE MY HUSBAND MORE THAN TWO WEEKS A YEAR OF VACATION.... Like my husband was more than willing to give up his entire vacation if it meant I would no longer be in 24/7 pain. But cuz I dont have anyone for the rest of the 4 weeks apparently thats one of the reasons I cant have the surgery, again aside from the ""removing ""healthy"" organs. THEY ARENT HEALTHY IF THEY CAUSE ME PAIN BRENDA....

Oh and the best thing! I was told by my OB, oh you probably dont have endo cuz we only really see it in teenagers, almost never in adults. Meanwhile I researched the absolute crap out of it, cross-checking symptoms, and about 80% of the articles said its found in adults around my age. So she basically flat out lied to me or was too lazy or was not up to date on new info or something

Oh and the ovarian excuse I was given, which I still dont know if its real or not. Apparently when the egg is released its in a cyst that explodes and that pressure pushes the egg to the fallopian tube, and so everytime ""a cyst explodes"" I'm in extreme agony that in some cases is debilitating. So ""healthy"" my ass.
That’s fascinating, and probably also logical, when I think how underdiagnosed it is everywhere :( It’s heartbreaking that getting diagnosis is so hard, there should be some way to rapid test it, we are not talking about a rare disease, there’s so many people suffering :<
My emergency obgyn insisted I keep one if it was healthy in my hyst. Which it was so we did. But there was no reason to keep the rest, healthy or not, if I wasn’t going to reproduce. I would try another obgyn.
I'm literally waiting for the Tory voters to die out
Fair
I haven't really looked into all the reasons to keep your cervix. I thought it always had to be removed. When I was looking into the condition I was thrust into, it said usually they keep the cervix intact when they take out the uterus in this case. I had assumed it was to lessen the chances of having prolapse. Though, like I said, I didn't research that part lol. 

Thank you for the insight! Since you've done a lot of research I just have one question lol, did you see any other types of complications that can occur from getting a hysterectomy? I wanna know what I should research more in depth
This is all such BS. I'm so sorry you're dealing with all this. They're not at all healthy if they're cystic and causing you pain!! Ughhhh. And ""not found in adults."" Ummmm WHAT?!? Most people aren't diagnosed until their late 20s because doctors dismiss their symptoms when they're younger. Basically, your OB is an idiot. 

Also, I've had four abdominal surgeries (three endo-related and a C-section) and I was fine within 2-3 weeks after each surgery. Insisting you need help for the entire six-week suggested recovery period is complete nonsense.
Its been a long 2-3 years...
Re the ovary thing— I think it’s time for a new doctor who knows wtf bc this one does not know real life 😬”a cyst explodes” if you have so many cysts that they constantly explode you’re in serious danger so that’s not how that works at all. That would create an open internal wound. Every time. Like. No. No no. That’s not how that works. Wtaf.
Absolutely heartbreaking! I had symptoms for, no lie, \*13 years\* before I was informally diagnosed based on my symptoms. That doctor told me I wouldn't need surgery until I wanted to have kids (even though my quality of life was shit because of my symptoms), and I didn't have surgery until three years later when I was completely disabled by my symptoms. Endo is a nightmare and we need much better solutions for diagnosing and treating it for sure.
Mmmm. 20-30 more years and they’re out, more or less? Maybe 15 til they stop voting? 💀
Yes there are a number of possible complications, the good news is though that since hysterectomies are the second most commonly performed surgery on those afab in the US, the doctors know how to fix all of them. I am not a doctor, these are just the ones I know of, and many of these have a very low chance of happening. Try not to be too freaked out by the list, this is just me trying to be thorough. Good luck! 💗 I hope you feel better very soon. 

Infection

Cuff tear

Ovarian failure

Granulation of your scar tissue

Pelvic floor prolapse

Snapping your stitches on accident 

Accidental burning of your bladder tubes

UTI

Hematoma (a big bruise caused by a broken blood vessel) 

Ovarian torsion
I’m so sorry to hear that :( I on the other hand had my share of *it will get better after kids* doctors in my life 🤡. Like even if I wanted kids, I’m not gonna just make one because it may help with my pain, that’s ridiculous. I strongly believe that I got diagnosis because I had my sterilisation surgery few months before, so the doctor knew that he can’t just suggest getting pregnant xD He said that some people take homeopathic stuff and i can try that, so not that much better 🫠
Labour voters are increasing as the kids turn 18, whereas Tory voters are aging and dying. It hopefully won't be long until there's more Labour voters than Tory voters. After that we can vote in someone more left than centrist
Thank you for the list!! I'm confused by a couple of these but this definitely will help when I research so I can make sure I cover all the bases.
AND THE ""PREGNANCY SOLUTION"" IS A LIE ANYWAY! Not yelling at you obviously. I just cannot with the fact that doctors still tell people this. Pregnancy does not treat or cure endo! For some people, it makes endo worse! And spot on with the ""I'm not gonna have a kid just to treat my medical issue."" Like, how does anyone think that's okay?!?
Crossing my appendages for you to get there as soon as possible 💙 

I hope the U.S. shifts as well, but the GOP does a good job of fucking their kids to where they believe the same backwards ass beliefs, so it may be a struggle. I’m just going to do my part to keep my state as blue as possible, meanwhile.
👍
I’ve heard so many horror stories of people who had babies and it got worse that I can’t even. And I don’t want to have kids, but I love and respect them, and just thinking about having one just to what, maybe get my endo better just seem cruel and sad :<. Not even going in the whole bruh that is literally my body and pregnancy is traumatic experience, how dare you suggest that, because I’m from a country that doesn’t even have legal abortion xD
That's all we can do. And try to educate those around us. It annoys me most when working class people vote right despite them being entirely against ""the Poor's""
HARD same. In the US there’s a great deal of propaganda that is fed into the right, though; getting people to vote against their better interests can be easy if you make it out like you’re out to “stop the bad guys” instead of the reality of gutting human rights."	11g0e58	NonBinary	200	1.0	2023-03-02 11:24:25

can i be nonbinary transmasc without taking surgery or hormones?	"over the last year after a lot of questioning, i've come to the conclusion that i'm nonbinary transmasc (AFAB). i actually questioned if I was FTM as a teenager for 6 months  (down to cutting my hair and dressing like a boy and watching trans youtubers) but ultimately decided that being a binary trans guy wasn't for me. i spent most of the next ten years (from 14 to 24) bouncing back to the other binary and trying to be a cis woman but ultimately not being able to do so. two years ago i started to acknowledge my queer identity and explored my gender identity. about a year ago I realized that i'm definitely nonbinary transmasc. i'd say i'm more a boy than a girl but not completely a boy.

i don't think i want to take testosterone at least not now because i'm not sure i want all the effects. and while i definitely have significant chest dysphoria (my ideal body would have a flat/flat-ish chest) for now i don't want top surgery, because i'm able to lessen my dysphoria enough through clothing. am i still valid in considering myself nonbinary transmasc without taking any medical interventions? i've started to transition in other ways (ie. wear masculine clothing, stopped shaving my legs, prefer they/them pronouns although i'm not insisting on it)."	"[removed]
You can be whoever you want to be* and you don't need others' permission 😊

_*And that might change over time_
You can absolutely be so without HRT or surgery!
 I (AMAB) have been questioning quite a bit and for awhile thought I was transfem, but ultimately landed on just enby. 

I don't think I want to start HRT and I am currently not interested in surgery, but I absolutely consider myself trans non-binary.

I think about it like this non binary isn't just option 3 (after male/female) it is options 3 to infinity. It is everything that _isn't_ male or female. So if non-binary transmasc feels right and like it describes you, then it's 100% valid and awesome!
Hormones and surgery can help you feel more comfortable in your body, if that helps you feel more comfortable in your body. But they are nit required to be Trans of any flavor.
You could always start on a low low dose of testosterone and then go from there. I have a friend who is transmasc but had to go the slow route and they’re still getting a little of a beard and whatnot just slower. If you start taking it and it feels good and natural, then ask to go up.
Thanks, everyone for these comments. I'm not OP, but am going through similar struggles (never-ending wait times for HRT, it's been 2 years now), and I felt like I wasn't valid as a transmasc person, especially after seeing so many posts about people on hormones.

It was really affirming reading all this.
I am so damn glad the answers have been overwhelmingly positive. See, I think of myself as femme-leaning trans-nonbinary lesbian, but amab and not on medication/surgery. It's just the way I feel.
Yes. You don't have to transition in any way you don't want to
Yeah. Being transgender does not require any particular type of transition if that is not something you want.
yeah, I'm transmasc/nonbinary and in the same boat. Have questioned if I'm FTM, but don't fully feel that way and am not sure any kind of medical transition is for me. Sometimes get upset that being nonbinary is really not taken seriously by many people, but I know it's real for me. Even if some people see me as just a masc cis girl - the truth is my experience of gender is outside the norm regardless of what you wanna call it and IDing as nonbinary/transmasc feels most true to me. 

Gender is self-expression and self-exploration, and everyone should be able to determine what gendered things (clothes, pronouns, identities) they align with without having to prove themselves as valid. Gender norms & standards have always been something that is enforced, and gatekeeping trans-ness is an extension of that system. Being nonbinary is, for me, about rejecting that system completely.
You don’t need permission to be who you are
You should look up Ryan Cassata, he’s trans and has had top surgery but does not take T. Good role model :)
I think it's better than taking hormones or getting any other medical interventions done at all. I know that some people feel a lot better with affirming treatments, but gender is a social construct, right?

Just be a dude with a vagina. You're still a guy.

Sometimes I'm a woman with a penis. That's not invalid. Modifying my body is something I don't feel is necessary at all. This one works pretty damn well.
Aside from taking a couple of decades longer to come to the conclusion, I'm in the same place as you but opposite - AMAB, not wanting surgery or hormones, but asserting my gender choice in feminine clothing, starting to shave legs and preferring they/them over he/him but not really caring.

I'll never be, or look, binary feminine, and I chose not to be, or look most of the time, binary masculine, so I think that's a valid definition of being between the two, siding towards female gender, so non-binary transfemme would, I guess, describe me quite well (although just ""non-binary"" is probably sufficient) - and similarly non-binary transmasc sounds a perfectly acceptable box for you to sit in if you desire for a named box :-)
Yes. Ignore people who say you need to medically transition to be trans.
You are valid regardless of where you are in your transition or if you choose not to transition at all. 

You are valid regardless of how you dress, act, or talk.

 you are valid in the closet, you're valid if you're out. 

There is no requirement, you're trans if you feel trans.
You are in charge of how you identify/express your self! Read it again!!! 🫶
Yes! For me being nonbinary is a social thing. I don't want any surgeries or hormone therapy.
Yes
You don’t need to transition to be trans. You are 100% valid, if you feel like you’re trans, you’re trans.
Yes. Do your own thing. You define your own gender! Labels aren't made to be something restrictive that you need to conform yourself to.
You are valid as you are. I’m trans masc nonbinary. No hormones, sometimes I like my chest, sometimes it’s in the way and sometimes I’m indifferent. We’re both valid trans people
You can be anything you want to be, except for a rude person lol you owe no one anything, as long as you're happy, you win
Yes. You are who you are. Gender identity has one definition, how you perceive yourself, and ONLY how you see yourself. No one else can tell you who you are or make that decision for you and there are no requirements. I know it’s messy and anxiety riddled at times but don’t over think it. Just be your favorite you 🤷🏻
Yes!
yes you can <3
Simply, yes
Yup!
Whatever you feel and whatever you present yourself as, you are valid! Even if it doesn't fit into any boxes like we're used to. You are what you call yourself and nobody can change that.
Of course you can. I am
YES. BYE.
yep
you are just as trans as someone who does medically transition. i'm nonbinary transmasc and i'm on a SUUUPER low dose of T because i'm terrified of growing a beard. i'm still trans, and so are you :)
Trans and nonbinary are umbrella terms! You can use as you wish, as long as you identify different than your assigned gender at birth and don't fall within the ""binary"" of male vs female! Technically all nonbinary people are trans(I think / afaik) and you can identify however vague or precise as you like!
explaining isn't needed. it's always going to be yes
Yes.
What way you express yourself or identify yourself is yours. But if you feel unconfident about it I know this other non-binary whom is transfem.... They are more girly than the girls we all know. And as it stands they don't take any meds and just do that with clothes.
We need a bot that just responds to every post beginning with ""can i be non-binary if..."" with ""yes""
you can be whatever you want to be there are no rules except the ones you make for yourself
you are valid, you are you and only you can say who you are <3
is it okay to call myself trans? i definitely don't feel cis.
I reallyyyyyy vibe with your avatar and username lol
If it’s social what is the difference between non-binary and gnc?
are you going to take T for a predetermined time and then stop or cycle on/off? or just feel it out and see how it goes?
[removed]
Trans doesn't mean ""transitioned"". It means across, different from.

Most trans people transition either socially or medically in some way. But even if you don't transition at all, being nonbinary means you're ""across"" from the gender you were assigned at birth — you weren't assigned to be nonbinary at birth after all!
Definitely, yes!
Absolutely you can.
Trans included everyone who does not identify with their gender assigned at birth, so obviously including nonbinary people.

But I do get the feeling, cuz when cis people say trans they usually mean binary trans people (usually only those who fully transition sadly), so oftentimes I also feel like I don't fit into that description of trans, that cis ppl have started to understand and use.
I don't get complements all too often. And I've had this one pop into my head randomly at least once a day all week.

So, thank you.

ଘ(੭ºัᴗºั)━☆ﾟ*:.
Idk for me at least, I definitely have gender dysphoria even though I don't want (right now) hormones and surgery. Also, I feel nonbinary even if I'm wearing a dress or naked lol. I've never felt like a woman regardless of what I'm wearing or how I'm presenting. And I don't quite feel like a man either (though I think that feels more aligned than being a woman).

So socially transitioning (ie. clothing, pronouns, not shaving etc) helps lessen dysphoria and makes my gender presentation more aligned with my gender identity.  Hormones and surgery can also do that, but for now I don't know if it's necessary for me. Maybe down the road that'll change.
I don't know, I'm still discovering my identity and some of those terms are pretty new to me. For the most of my life I lived as gay intersex male, being nonbinary is recent and I'm sorry if I say something wrong or confusing about it.
my plan rn is to feel it out. since i’m on such a low dose changes will come slowly so ill have time to adjust to whatever does happen
thank you guys, this thread was extremely affirming!
Ah, so the way you've decided to transition is what's social then, not your identity. That makes sense.
That's ok. I just think it's really important (for everyone) to know that social roles and presentation are a very different thing from gender itself. Trans people can be GNC too, but it wouldn't make them cis, you know? They're completely separate, like orientation.
I know. I can speak just from my point of view, I'm not trying to make an assumption about the whole community. I have that problem that I'm not trans and cis either so it's hard for me to fit in some spaces.
Yeah, I get that"	10jeq7l	NonBinary	199	0.97	2023-01-23 15:12:09
Dysphoria has been gross, so I decided a new shirt was in order		"Hey I’m kinda high but you look kind of like a lion .. in a good way 😂✌️
Aaaaaaah, I love both the shirt and necklace.
Cute!!! Your eyebrows are legitimately my goal, they look so good. 
You look so good!! The shirt is badass 
This is so gooooodd holy shit i wish i could look more like you!!!! ❤❤❤
Holy fuck you look good keep it up!
Digging the necklace
Awesome shirt!  Did it help with the dysphoria?  If so, where can others obtain these magical, gender affirming garments?
I feel you on a deep level. Just found a sweater that makes me look like... Myself. I never wanna take it off. You look fantastic <3

What’s your dysphoria proof outfit? Mines overalls! :)		"Hoodie, long pants. (oh wait, that's what I always wear)
Black shirt, grey jeans and a checkered black and white bowtie
Mine's a tuxedo or blue jeans+shirt+button up+belt (also, you look amaaazing! I love overalls :) )
I love overalls but my boobs are too big lol

Mines black jeans and black band hoodies that are slightly oversized
Or anything overknee socks.

Luckily don't have dysphoria but I'm just feeling like myself in these clothes (hoodie and overknees are the best)
I seriously need a pair like these! Where did you find them?
Large large sweaters and leggings. You look amazing btw :))
Anything that's black and makes me look more metal (I have long hair and this way I feel comfy AND don't get misgendered🤘)
I have three different pairs of overalls (casual, everyday, and smart) for this very reason.
Tight pants and a wide necked shirt :)
Boiler suit, so pretty much the same thing!
Tapered blue jeans with rolled up an inch at the bottom and a bluey black men's button up shirt with black long sleeves underneath. Makes me feel frickin invincible when I wear it. I feel like myself and no pressure to look a certain way 😌👌

Your overalls are really cute btw where'd you get them?
Oh no they're hotttt!! I wish I looked good in overalls but I look like every farmer you've ever seen in an ad!
My one tank top and my blue sweatpants.
Those are some heckin' stylin' overalls!

My outfit is black high-waisted pants and a white button-down.
Button up, black jeans and suspenders 😊
Hoodie is also very yes
Heck yeah
A tux is a power move I love it
Hoodie and over knee socks is a vibe I may need to try myself :D
Thrift store, so sadly I cannot help ya out D: it always takes so much searching to find a good pair of overalls!
That’s another solid go to for me too :D and thank you!
That’s awesome :D
This is goals
Wide necked shirts make me feel great as well!!
I gotta get me one of those
Love that :D I got them at a thrift store so unfortunately I’m not sure where they came from!
Truthfully these are my “feeling confident” overalls. I have a usual everyday pair that’s like baggy and blue and def gives off farmer vibes but I lean into it
Great find!!
Thanks :D thrift stores are the best
Where did you get that pair? They look bespoke haha. I want something that form fits my body like that!
Thrift shop D: so sadly they’re a mystery!

Would you rather be completely flat chested with the option to swap out breasts? or have breasts and have to bind to be flat?	"This is a question I've been thinking a lot as someone who's agender and biologically female. I would 100% be happier with no breasts at all, but a small part of me kinda thinks having them wouldn't be so bad if they were easily removable rather than permantly attached to me and the only other way to look like I have a flat chest is through chest binding. It does feel euphoric to not see breast bumps but other times brings more dysphoria because it makes me more aware of their presence since I can feel it being squished against me and it never feels flat enough like a cis guy to be convincing. 

it would be similar to those breast forms you see crossdressers or drag queens wear, except they look realistic and you could actually feel it on your body as if they were on you to begin with plus get to choose the sizing as well. I was wondering if anyone else felt the same way regardless of asab"	"If breasts were *completely* removable and replaceable, like an easy application, fuck yeah I'd be in on that. I have so much chest dysphoria but think that being able to remove them easily and put them back on for dressing femme would be fun
I have often thought that I would love my breasts if they were accessories I could choose to wear only when I want them
I got a compression injury last year and couldn't bind for over a month; due to chest acne, tape was out of the picture too. I don't choose to bind all the time, but it was awful when I had no ability to bind when I wanted to. It made me realize that I would rather have the flat chest with breast forms when I want them. Compression injuries are no joke.
flat chested even if I'm feeling femenine
My nipples are extremely sensitive and are my main source of pleasure in sex, much more than down area therefore even though id prefer to be flat, i cant do anything about them. Itd extremely frustrsting. Wish i could just switch them off in daily life and then hsve them reappear when im eith my partner.
In an ideal world, I’d rather be flat chested with detachable breasts. It would be fun to wear them occasionally when I feel like presenting more fem (and my gender is a bit fluid anyways.) but a lot of the time I wish I did not have a visible chest. Maybe I’ll end up getting top surgery and just wear padded bras on certain days if I feel like it or something.
flat with the option, definitely have always liked the idea of being able to choose when to wear them like accessories. like packing kinda
As someone who didn't have natural breasts and used to use forms, and now on HRT has natural breasts and binds sometimes, I prefer the latter situation personally.
Would absolutely love removable tits.

I have very similar feelings as you towards my breasts. 

I plan to see how small they'll become as I lose weight and gain muscle, and may supplement that with breast reduction - I've always been cursed with huge tits. 

I feel like because I'm used to how binding feels with big tits, maybe it'll be less noticeable or uncomfortable with smaller ones.

Fortunately I don't often experience dysphoria and binding provided enough relief that it doesn't affect me much. So I figure it's ok for me to take time to explore.

I also haven't tried T-tape so I want to give that a go.

If I still feel dysphoric, I may consider top surgery. But I'll cross that bridge if/when I come to it. Same with HRT. 

I'm a late bloomer who grew up Catholic, and a visible minority in a white community in the 90s. I didn't realize I was bi until I was 26, I healed/learned enough to realize I was NB at 31 (still figuring out what that means to me, exactly).

I figure if it's taken me this long just to realize *ya no doy, you like girls!*, I might as well take my time adapting my body to who I am as I kinda figure that out.
I’m a bio female with a fairly small chest region. For me a right sports bra and a baggy shirt will help get a more androgynous look, but for when I want to look more feminine, or even just include them in my appearance for the day ( I like to dress super masculine while still having them present just because some days that feels more like the gender I’m expressing). I’ve often wished I could I remove them completely in certain times in my life. But after experimenting with my style and what works for me. I wouldn’t get rid of them at al. But I’d cry my eyes out if they grew any bigger lol
 I could never get surgery bc I would feel dysphoric without them but I would love if they were retractable like you press a button or smth & they pop in
I'd much prefer flat with breast I could pop on and off whenever.
I hate having tits. I never saw why all the girls I knew were so proud or disappointed with the boobs puberty gave them. I remember my then-13/14 best friend telling me, triumphantly, that she had graduated from an A-cup to a B-cup and I had to try to be like “oh, cool!” while internally being like “the last time I was an A-cup, I was probably about 7 years old”. I’m starting to think that my vehement dislike of my boobs means I’m probably not as agender/nonbinary as I thought. I can’t fathom would ever want boobs, ever, even if they were removable.
I'd rather have breasts and bind.
I'd rather bind tbh sometimes I love my boobs other times I'm like why do i have to live with you right now.
FLAT
I wish I could just swap stuff out whenever I want like a Potato Head
I don't have breasts, but do desire to have them eventually. I think I would still absolutely love the ability to swap them out, even if just for the convenience of having nothing there.
The only thing I have against my own chest is that I can't go to beaches or do yard work without a top on, and it be socially acceptable and not sexual in the slightest. I have cried thinking about how I might never feel wind on my bare chest. Its an experience I long to have so deeply, it looks like it would be just the most freeing experience.

people born without breasts don't even realize how lucky they are for just this. I've talked to cis men and they just don't get it, they just tell me to wear a bikini or find a nude beach.
I am also agender and I plan on having a reduction. I don’t know if I would bind after wards, it would already be such a drastic difference just going down to a b/c for me. I don’t think I want a flat chest, but both of us are 1000% valid
As someone who is AFAB and identifies as nonbinary/transmasc, while I technically don’t have a ‘small’ chest (think I’m like a C or D but I also have broad shoulders), the shape of my body works very well for looking flat chested when I go without a bra, and when I feel like looking more feminine and filling something out, I wear a pushup bra (which is my favorite bra but that’s more because of the shape of my chest and the support and comfort it gives me). So like I really lucked out and don’t have to bind so I personally fall in the middle of that lol
Also agender, also AFAB. I am two months post op and so glad I went for a completely flat chest. Even if I had the option to swap out, I wouldn't do it.
100% would choose no chest. Dysphoria + how uncomfortable it is just to lie on my stomach lol. I want the freedom to lay how I please god damnit!
The only time I like having breasts is in bed. I would love to be able to take them off and keep them next to the other toys....
flat chest!!!! a hundred times, boobs are over rated
See I knew I wasn't cis when I was telling myself ""I wish parts could just come on and off like if I could swap out bottom parts or just take off my boobs at night"" I was thinking more like being able to just screw in a penis attachment and set my boobs aside like you mentioned! I've tenetivly been saying I'm gender queer but ive only come out to a few friends and my husband. My pronouns are publicly she/they on social media including in my fb bio no one checks. No one uses anything but she though 🤷🏼‍♀️. I'm currently pregnant (it causes some dysphoria but I've always wanted to carry my own child. I would love me some man-ternity outfits tho.) So swollen boobs are def a nuisance. I keep wishing I could just put my boobs and uterus on a shelf so I can have a little break. I love being pregnant and growing a human but this shit is tough!
If someone is giving permanent breasts away, I’ll take them!
Oh yeah yup I'm kinda feeling that....

At least in some situations?? 

I'm very indecisive: Once my online avatars in various different games don't have breasts, I'm usually never putting them back on, I don't like the look, it's just not how I want to present myself at all... However, I'm not sure if the same would apply in real life?? Sensory-wise, I like touching them, they're nice and soft and warm, but I also still hate how they look on me and literally exclusively wear baggy tops and slouch to appear as flat as possible.

It's a complicated situation. 

On one hand I kinda want top surgery and I envy people who get it, but on the other hand the permanence kinda scares me???
Detachables
Click on, click off, please.
I mean, if it's truly optional, I wouldn't hate the existence of such things, and might occasionally pick very small ones versus *nothing*. But it'd be a stylistic choice, not because I have gender dysphoria from having a flat chest.
completely flat, for me
I'd rather be completely flat chested.
nah, i don't want boobs ever
I love my chest when I’m naked, hate them when I’m wearing t shirts. Enjoy them when I’m wearing a very loose shirt as they sit quite low on my chest so if the first top buttons are undone it looks like I have quite a flat chest and and my chest feels free and comfortable at the same time below it. I have double Ds for context but a broad back. A lot of the dysphoria/ euphoria for me depends on clothing. I stopped binding after two years of it about 6 months ago as like you it made me more aware of them and more dysphoric. Often I think about having mosquito bites or completely flat so I can wear t shirts with nothing underneath. But I would miss them being bigger when naked. I don’t feel gendery at all when I’m naked! Just feel like I’m
In original human mode.
Flat, 100%. Even if switching it around wasn’t an option tbh, although that would be a cool perk.
I mean having removable and customozable breast sounds optimal lol. For me my boobs are naturally small if i put on a sport bra and hoodie i pretty much look flat and if i want to show off what I have I can so im okay with where im at
My ideal would be some kind of dimmer switch, lol.
if the equippable ones looked exactly like real ones, definitely the first option. I'm almost flat, mine don't even show through my clothes when I wanna look femenine, yet they still feel like they have the right to HURT and show just enough to bother me when I wanna look masculine. Fuck I hate them so much
I want them gone and staying gone.
i would rather be flat
I don't want them. I want to be flat.
Flat chested 100%. I can't bind or yeet them because of other significant health issues, and it sucks. I would still like to be able to have a feminine sillouette available to me, but frankly I wouldn't use it much.
I’d just choose being flat chested all the time if they could magically disappear without surgery or risk of losing nipple sensation.
See, I would rather bind because the feeling of forms just isn’t a good one, they look nice but feel horrendous after a while, and seeing as how I would prefer to have boobs binding would only happen like once a month instead of breast forms which I would have to do daily
If I could pop em off I wouldn't need top surgery, so I'd say only if they come off completely. I already bind daily and it's not doing enough for me.
If I could occasionally velcro some on for the rare occasions when I want to wear a femme top, I'd chop my naturals immediately. 

As is, I'm still deciding.
I would soooo go #1, there are days where I love them, but 99% of the time I HATE them.
I just want my man boobs gone ;-;
I always say I wish I had mr potato head parts. Sometimes I want my boobs but also a duck. Sometimes I want no boobs and a vag. Or any combination of those. I also have boobs that are too big to bind, especially because I’m chronically Ill so I wish I could just detach and attach as I please.
I’d love, like, A cups or small B cups. Just enough for a bit of a swell in a dress but also pretty easy to bind. I have 32Es and it’s basically not possible to bring them down so they look like realistic pecs against my waistline. Even with transtape (best results I’ve had so far) I MAYBE look like a C cup in a bra. I feel like small B cups would be a nice happy medium between no tits and tits.
I got top surgery and if I ever want boobs for a minute I can get breast forms to fake it
I would love to have breasts but with the option to bind.
I'm currently chestfeeding, so I wouldn't want anything to affect milk production, but it'd be neat if I could make them appear theren't while having them still be there.
The moment the technology is invented for this, I'm on it. I've always wished I could swap out my chest when I felt like it!
I’d rather be able to bind. I wouldn’t enjoy being flat chested permanently, but there are some button up shirts that blow up if I don’t use trans tape. I like touching my boobies sometimes and I’d be really lost without them.
As someone who's AFAB I am very grateful to be basically flat chested. I can just wear a relatively form fitting sports bra and don't need a binder.
Having huge tits and a huge dick at the same time wouldn't bother me.

Especially if the parts were modular and you could mix and match.
I want to get top surgery and then a chest plate so I can have tiddies when I feel like it lmao
I don't care for the sensation of having them attached but the aesthetic can be nice once in a while.
The first one, because I don't like the idea of having breasts at all. So I'd just keep them removed all the time
Anytime flat but to be fair, I’m AFAB and haven’t had top surgery so I’m currently binding and not all that flat when I do.
I'm happy with my tiny titties actually. It's my really feminine/curvy stomach and hips I could do with less of. They're such a give away that there's little point to binding. I'd love if I could change my hip size based on how femme/masc I'm feeling.
Completely flat, I personally have no desire to have boobs regardless of what my agab is, and binding is always such a hassle in hot weather :(
Not having boobs caused me so much dysphoria that now they finally grew the idea of losing them is horrifying. I'd take the binding option, especially if it was comfortable and had no risk of causing damage.
I generally like my chest as it is, but occasionally, I would like to have a flat chest without binding - I'd love to wear a suit over a flat chest, for example. 

I think what frustrates me most about my body is that it is impossible for it to be everything I want it to be, even if I had easy access to hormones/surgery etc. I'm clearly not alone in feeling that way!
Completely flat chest
No chest just nipples!
I personally don’t mind binding. I know lots of people find it incredibly uncomfortable, but I’ve personally gotten very used to the compression. Honestly, even if I did get top surgery, I think I would still wear compression tops.
I don't understand the whole obsession with breasts that the majority of humanity has. They use it to tell us that we are female despite anyone can have breasts because it is literally fat wrapped in skin on the chest.

I know why we are, and I would totes want them to come like purses. so you can say ""today I want to wear them"" or ""today I am going flat.""
I want mine to have two lil magnets so I can attach them when I want them
i mean, i got top surgery and then bought breast forms after for exactly this reason lollll
This so much. I think someone else in this sub said something about a Mr.Potatohead body being the dream and that stuck with me. Let us mix and match all the parts
Yes
100% this
Yea i getcha. Kinda in the same vein, i wish a properly fitted binder were as easy to get as a tshirt and just as unremarkable
I would add on if I got to pick their size too.  Sometimes an outfit calls for an A cup or maybe a small B others you need a solid D for.  If I have removable breasts I want them in different sizes and with accessories.
I'm there with ya. I prefer to be flat most of the time, but to me any chance of losing/reducing nipple sensation is an unacceptable risk. I have referred to my breasts as ""no longer for public consumption"" lol, but I like them when alone/with a partner.
genuinely curious why the latter. you don't find binding to be hassle I'm assuming?
I feel like for many cis women, having boobs is one of the earliest signs of womanhood and becoming an adult so that's why they get excited over their chest growing during puberty and some even get boob envy from other girls if theirs aren't big enough. if a girl either doesn't care or has no chest yet, they're deemed a late bloomer or immature stupidly enough.
I developed early and remember being so embarrassed when my 4th grade teacher told me I had to start wearing a bra. I remember feeling gross and alien. As I got older I appreciated that they’re ‘aesthetically pleasing’; but literally they’re just in my way unless I’m having sex and they’re getting attention 🙄 I’m going to talk to my doctor about top surgery soon; if the options include the surgeries that aren’t as likely to damage the nerves there I’m going for it
I can dress femme and be flat, i cant dress mask bc even with the biggest shirt my boobs are there
if we were in a cyberpunk future where switching body parts was as easy as Mr. Potato Head, that would be the idea lol. I unfortunately have a large chest, somewhere around DDs and while a medium chest binder can reduce it down a size + help with oversized shirts, it just doesn't feel the same since it's not completely flat. I actually did debate with myself if a breast reduction down to AAs would be a better compromise since I'm not doing a binary ftm transition anyways and I still want some physical femininity on my body. But I've thought it through and would rather permant flatness. I'd worry about my chest growing back in size if I did get a reduction, not to mention never having to wear undergarments on my chest ever again feels like the dream
I suppose I might if they were bigger. As it stands binding is convenient and comfortable. I definitely enjoy having them have sensation, which you obviously don't get with prosthetics. And I tend to prefer them most days, so having them be there by default is nice.
One huge issue with forms is the lack of surface sensation, it can really throw the brain off.
THIS
Honestly I didn't have good awareness of surface sensation with homegrown breasts. It was one of the more distressing things about them to me, that they were *there* but physically seemed separate from my body. Even when they were first growing, I remember finding that weird."	11eezai	NonBinary	194	1.0	2023-02-28 17:49:59

My most hated misconception of non-binary people	"That we're non-binary simply because we 'don't fit into our gender roles.' Who told them this?! It would mean that feminine or masculine non-binary people are just women and men, no one thinks like this!

You can be a masculine woman, man, or non-binary person, your presentation doesn't matter. You can be a woman who doesn't match any stereotype or gender role and still be a woman. What matters is how you feel internally, if you view yourself as a woman or not, if you feel more comfortable saying you're non-binary, a woman, or a man, that's all.

Gender roles and whether you suit them does not matter. Even for trans people, I've noticed them saying that they feel more comfortable experimenting with things that match their AGAB's stereotypes after transitioning/coming to terms with their gender. Why? Because it wasn't the action itself that they hated, it was how doing the action made people see them!

They didn't play with dolls because they felt uncomfortable with being seen as a girl for playing with them! If dolls weren't associated with girls, they probably would've tried them and guess what, in either reality, they'd still be trans.

If there was a reality where boys went through a coming-of-age ceremony where they eat cake and girls went through the same ceremony, but they eat pie, then the trans boys in that world would want to eat cake and the trans girls would want to eat pie. Does that mean cake is inherently masculine and pie is inherently feminine? No, it just means that trans kids like being affirmed in their gender, even if the source is a ridiculous social rule.

Trans people are not saying that associating with the other gender's stereotypes makes you trans. ""Then why do they point out all the ways they avoided stereotypes of their AGAB as proof of dysphoria?"" Because what made them dysphoric wasn't the action itself (playing with dolls or playing sports, for example), it was the associated stereotype that came with it, it was the fact adults and other kids saw them as more feminine/masculine depending on what they did. Obviously, it varies with culture."	"You actually helped me in something that is on my mind a lot lately (I guess because I'm kind of questioning if I'm really as cis as I thought), but didn't fit with every gender identity. I've asked myself the question that if gender and their general associated looks, behaviours, roles etc. wouldn't have been so rigid historically and partially still are nowadays, would still everyone who identifies as another gender now identify as that same gender in that hypothetical less rigid society? Would there be more different genders or less?  

In my first language we don't have different words for sex and gender so the latter is basically called ""social gender"" (or, if you take biological sex as the base word, it would be ""social sex"" but that just sounds really weird) which kind of implies that gender is a social construct and would work differently if that construct was different than it is now.  

I hope this doesn't come across offensive, it's really just thoughts about hypothetical scenarios that I think about while I try to find out if I don't 100% feel like I'm cis or if I just don't feel comfortable in that gender role (and I already got angry at society for being at least partly responsible that this is so hard for me right now, but I got some nice tips for the way I can handle that)
I was just thinking about how much I hate gender stereotypes, especially when it comes to personality traits and behaviour.

Like as an agender person I don't get how any of that shit can be gendered in the first place. I am not saying that gender is fake, I just don't see what your personality traits, mannerism and childhood toys has to do with it.
I feel that. Even cis binary people don't fit into gender roles. Don't mean that they're trans or enby. I feel like misconceptions like this come from the idea that if one doesn't conform to stereotypical gender roles at all, then they have to trans/non binary, which is not only close mind in terms of the variations of gender, but also in terms of the variations of culture as well. Not every culture has the same gender roles, so even if someone follows the gender roles of, like Western Europeon gender stereotypes/roles for example, then they're considered non binary because they may not conform to Western gender roles. It's just dumb and close minded.
Wow, I agree, your text really hit me while I truly felt concerned by this. And I understand fully what you mean. Maybe not all trans person or non-binary person are like this, but I'm think a good part of them are
I've found that even the concept of non-binary is hard for a lot of people to grasp, even beyond gender. I suspect it's rooted in some primitive survival instinct to ascribe everything a label of ""if not this, then that"". At best, some see it as this confusing, third gender because they don't want the simplicity of a binary system challenged.

This isn't a defense, or a justification. Honestly, it's not a tough concept to grasp, I just think most people don't want to do the mental work to logically conclude that gender, and all that defines it, is an arbitrary construct. Valuable in some ways, sure, but ultimately made up, and therefore, flexible.

But as a non-binary person, I find it helps me better explain myself to those who don't understand me if I can understand where they're coming from. Which sucks, and I wish I didn't feel the need to explain myself as much as I do, but it is what it is.
Heck yeah to this. Tired of people missing the whole point -- non BINARY cuz we don't subscribe to the BINARY. We don't think there's two genders. It's not 1's and 0's for us. It's A-Z. It's whatever one wants.
I think I understand.  I'm AFAB ENBY and I thought I needed to reject anything remotely ""feminine"" to make it work.  

What I learned is I cannot control how people perceive me.  Now IDGAF if I feel like being more masc leaning I am, if I want to partner that with some eye makeup that's ok too.
Don't you just love how some languages gender inanimate objects then get all demanding about the gender we prefer to be called and how that compares to how we act. A table doesn't act feminine, why do I have to if I wanted to be a girl.
Don't fit into my gender roles? I don't \*have\* gender roles. 

It's actually nice though. I feel a lot more free to enjoy clothes, activities, etc that are often gendered. I can do what I want, what makes me happy. Obviously so can everyone else, binary gender or not - but I don't have those expectations hanging over me and making me second guess what I do.
I use mostly he him but also they and it pronouns, i have a common guy name ,and wanting to pass as a cis man, still nonbinary . Admittedly I'm kinda femme and flamboyant but more in a gay way than a way tied to my gender.
That we have to actively strike a balance between male and female in presentation.
Yes!! This is such a good post, thank you!!
""okay but are you theymab or theyfab"" .... arrrrgh
Super agree. I’m AMAB and I’ve known I’m enby (they/them) for almost 11 years now (since middle school). But I’ve always kept presenting in mostly masculine ways. Partially that’s because I’ve never come out to my parents or sibling, but it’s also because… well, feminine stuff is just a lot of work! Sure, I like makeup and feminine clothing and such, but I don’t like it enough to go through the work of all that when I can just wear a sweater and jeans instead. (The fact that masculine clothing is also the “default” is a whole other issue…)
That is so well put, thank you OP! Especially the part with cake/pie really brings across the point. I think it is good to be aware of those dynamics and to have an analytic view, like you do!
Not offensive at all. In fact, I've thought about it myself sometimes too. I believe that even if gender stereotypes or roles didn't exist, there would still be people who want to change their sex characteristics to match the other sex. There would also be people who want to be called or seen as a different gender, even if nothing changes.

If gender stereotypes didn't exist, I think most people would be much more androgynous in general and there'd also be less push back on gender affirming care. Hormone replacement therapy or top and bottom surgery may just be seen as normal, necessary health care for the mental health of trans people.

I think in that hypothetical place, I would still want to be called by male or neutral terms and not female ones, even if the association is less. While thought experiments are helpful, I would avoid getting too caught up in them, it's impossible to know for sure what you'd want. For example, everyone says they'd pull the lever in the trolley problem, but the reality may be much different.

One question is just to ask yourself if you'd rather be seen as a man, a woman, or something else entirely. Another question is, say for example, you like being feminine, would you rather be a feminine woman, a feminine man, or a feminine neither? Feel free to switch it out for androgynous or masculine. Another good one is, when you're old, do you see yourself as an old woman, an old man, or an old non-binary senior?

If you didn't have any social expectations to fulfill, would you be happy or comfortable with your gender?

You can look at GNC people and see if you identify more with them than non-binary people. I wish you the best of luck.
I think about this a lot. To a large extent, my queerness, neurodivergence, and transness are all defined by what I am not. I'm queer because Im *not* straight. I'm *non*binary. I'm *dis*abled.

They are the terms by which I am carved away from mainstream society and marginalized. I would love to live in a world where my gender, sexual orientation, and brain chemistry werent something that I had to consciously live my life around and find ways to adapt to a world that is unaccepting of me.
Yeah, I agree. It is pretty illogical and largely arbitrary, if people notice that something is liked by mostly women, then that thing is deemed feminine and vice versa. Gender roles tend to come from things society thinks women should be doing or men should be doing. Stereotypes come from things associated with a certain gender.

I'm saying this as someone who does get euphoria from 'masculine things' like wearing clothes associated with men or feels dysphoric from illogical things like the way I speak or word things. I am definitely not immune to societal influences, haha.

However, it's like the chicken and the egg, I feel dysphoric because I'm non-binary and don't like being seen as a woman. It's not like I inherently dislike feminine things and think that makes me non-binary. I would have no issue with them if they didn't cause people to read me as a woman, that's what I wish people would understand.
Agreed, and an interesting point raised about different cultures too. As a non-binary person, I will always be supportive of GNC people. Our experiences are similar, but absolutely not the same. GNC people are comfortable with their AGAB, we're not, that's it. Gender presentation doesn't matter or even come into the equation, in my opinion.

It honestly feels like transphobes trying to stir up trouble between us and cis GNC people. Ignoring the fact GNC trans people exist? Besides that, I always hear narratives like we're trying to 'take away all the cute tomboys' by convincing them they must be trans/non-binary, for some reason. First of all, what a weird narrative, acting like people exist for your desires. Second of all, no, we're not, tomboys will always exist like they always have. Stop making the existence of trans people out like a doomsday apocalypse of feminine men and masculine women.
Thank you, kind one, I'm glad to hear that. I honestly believe that the trans or non-binary people who think that not conforming to gender roles means you're trans are misinformed, no offense to them. I imagine in most cases, you can ask them what they think of butch/tomboy trans women or feminine non-binary people and hopefully they'll understand.

I really dislike when people think we're trying to change gender non-conforming people or force them into being non-binary. I really look up to GNC people and respect them a lot, I would never want to make them change.

What separates me is that they can say ""I'm a masculine woman"" and be okay with, even proud of that, and I can't, despite trying my hardest to. To me, it invokes a feeling of dread and I can feel a sinking pit in my stomach, same with being called 'she' or 'Miss.' Meanwhile, women wouldn't mind being called those things or calling themselves these things.
Don't worry, it doesn't come off as a justification at all, that's an interesting insight and I'm happy you shared it with me.

Sometimes I even think they try to think about it too hard. Non-binary means someone doesn't identify wholly as a man or a wholly as a woman, if at all. It doesn't need to be any deeper than that. Of course, you can explore it deeper, but most of the time, these people complain that it's too confusing. Anything is confusing when you scrutinize it so much, and if you don't want to take the time to understand it, you don't have to. Just be respectful and that's all we really want.

I absolutely agree on your view of gender as a social construct. To some people, gender is such a innate thing, like a rule of the universe, rather than a social construct. I don't know why, but it's probably how they were raised. On that note, saying gender is a social construct doesn't even mean we want to get rid of it. What we mean is, since it is one, why would it be impossible to have something other than man and woman? Besides, not even biological sex is so rigid. I think you said much better than me though. ""Valuable in some ways, sure, but ultimately made up, and therefore, flexible."" Succinct and precise.

Don't worry, I get that too, I prefer to be understanding to everyone as long as they're not resorting to personal attacks. Especially since I remember times where I've been ignorant in the past too; I'm not perfect, no one is. I also feel glad when I'm able to explain myself to people, but of course, no person should feel obligated to do so.
That's understandable. I know so many non-binary people who felt like they had to present the opposite of their AGAB to be taken seriously. I've also known non-binary people who present feminine if AFAB or masculine if AMAB and they tended to get dismissed as people just looking to be 'special.' But then if you present the opposite way, people say you're just GNC or gay and confused. It's damned if you do, damned if you don't.

Your current attitude is much healthier and something I always need to remind myself. Rock on!
That too. It's also very annoying when people assume man = masculine, woman = feminine, non-binary = androgynous, or assume *we* think that way.

Never in a million years! I will always support GNC cis and trans people.
I'm glad to hear it! I've been seeing a lot of misinformation lately about what non-binary people are/what non-binary means and it's really irritating.
I just physically recoiled, ha!
That's completely fair, my friend. I have the same issue of not being able to come out. You're just as non-binary as everyone else, even if you never change your clothing style. Our identities are much more than just wardrobe changes after all!
Thank you, that's very kind of you! I'm glad to hear it, I hope one day that everyone will realize what non-binary, and being trans in general, actually means.
I find myself wearing things one might consider associated with one gender or the next and  I wear things that I consider neutral. Most days I wear a mix.

Some days I feel more masculine, some days more feminine, some days a bit of both and my choices reflect that. 

To quote Prince: ""I'm not a woman. I'm not a man. I am something that you'll never understand""
Thank you for this answer!  
I think I excluded body dysphoria in my ""what if"", because I think that's another topic and one not always linked to identifying with another gender than your agab.  
And the main reason for thinking about the hypothetical society is probably that I can't really tell if I just change in how I present myself (as in, I don't like to be seen as feminine some days and other days I want to be more feminine) or if the reason I present myself differently on those days is rather a reaction to a changing connection to my cisgender.  
I know that I definitely feel like a woman on some days, but I'm not sure if that's the case on days I want to be more androgynous. Sometimes I just want to be.  

It's kind of hard because I've lived all my life with ""not fitting the mold"" but still being a girl/woman, even if I've been criticized and made fun of for being ""too boyish"" and not looking enough like a girl and other stupid things like that. So sorting this out while learning about gender and that I don't have to be a woman, but that I *can* feel like a woman and *not* at the same time and figuring out if that is the case for me is kind of complicated.
I hate being perceived as my AGAB... honestly I think it is rude when people make assumptions. Like to me it is a social faux pas.

My dysphoria I think is mostly about what I feel comfortable with. I forget that other people experience gender and will assume I do too. Ideally others would be unable to perceive me, or it would hurt to look at me like some eldritch creature. It can be very jarring to get gendered when you were just vibing.

I don't think I've ever thought of anything I do as feminine? Like I do what I want and other ppl can keep their weird gender stereotypes to themselves.

Edit : I feel better about getting misgendered in a masculine direction. Like it is still wrong, but at least they weren't able to guess my AGAB.
Its interesting because my enby sibling hates the term ""tomboy"" because it supposedly ignores the fact that trans afab kids exist. We both were called tomboy as kids and it turns out we were trans all along lol.
Yeah, for me, my stomach kind of contract when I'm calling by those words, and I tried my best for a really really long time to get used to it. But it's just sounds wrong, like it's clearly off track. I would have preferred, it would have be easier, but I can't neither. You're not alone, we're not alone
Exactly! Well put!
This works great as an explanation of gender too and not just being non binary though!! Labels and gender expectations are making people feel less comfortable to be their authentic selves & I feel like a lot of people are getting pigeonholed into thinking they’re one gender because they act a certain way when there’s just so much more to it than that.
That's fair, I hear you with that. I'm sorry to hear you've been criticized for that, people can suck.

Imagining gender as a spectrum, with man on one end, woman on the other, and neutral in the middle. Would it be fair to say you're somewhere in-between woman and neutral? Maybe with a few oscillations here and there, certain days leaning more towards woman or neutral?

At the end of the day, it's really up to you what label you feel a connection to. I've known some people who don't care about their identity, and it depends on the person if they identify as agender or stick with cis. Remember that you don't owe anyone anything and if you really feel happier identifying as one thing, you should! Labels exist to help us understand ourselves. Humans are weird and vary a lot. Two people can have similar experiences, but choose to identify in different ways.

It does sound like it bring you some discomfort being wholly a woman though. Do you feel any connection to terms like non-binary, feminine non-binary, demiwoman, or genderfluid? You could try comparing how you feel referring to yourself as those things vs how you feel referring to yourself as a woman.
That's fair, it makes sense that your sibling hates it since it's definitely misgendering when applied to you both. I've also seen people use it to dismiss trans people, stuff like ""you're just a confused tomboy!"" Ugh. However, I do think the term is still useful when applied to actual women! I've seen cis and trans women self-identify with the term for example.
Haha, are you me? For a long time, I tried my hardest to just be a gender non-conforming cis person too. I wanted to be cis for a long, long time. Still do sometimes, it would be easier, but the thought of it also fills me with unease; not because I don't want to be cis, just because if I were cis, it'd mean I'd have to be a woman.

Thank you, I'm glad to hear that. It feels better not being alone.
>Would it be fair to say you're somewhere in-between woman and neutral? Maybe with a few oscillations here and there, certain days leaning more towards woman or neutral?

Yeah that sounds kind of accurate. A bit like I am a woman but I'm also not, sometimes more and sometimes less but most days somewhere in the middle. But I think I do care about my identity, for example how I don't ever want to be seen as a man.

>Do you feel any connection to terms like non-binary, feminine non-binary, demiwoman, or genderfluid?

I've looked some labels up and while I'm a little bit confused about demi and paragender, I felt like how I understood paragender it felt the most comfortable besides simply saying I'm a woman. It feels a bit like wearing two different socks but both warm my feet and are completely fine to exist by each others side. I looked it up just today, so that impression is still really fresh and I don't know if it will stay that way
Hehe, no problem, but sounds like we went through similar things 🤝

Somedays my breast give me insane dysphoria. But other days I love them and love to draw attention to them.		"Man I feel that! Boobs and long hair both give me great euphoria some days, and dysphoria others. Would much rather just have it be one way!

same. sometimes i'm like why do i hate these things so much they're cool. but most of the time i want to rip them off and run around topless
Mood but the other way around (wishing I had real breasts vs wanting to look masculine and not have that extra weight)

I might be Enby?	"I don't feel dysphoria about my body, but I get the chills if someone calls me a ""man"" or ""sir"". ""Boy"" and ""brother"" also hurt me.

Am I valid? :)"	"Of course you're valid love! Have fun on your journey
Those were indicators for me.  And I have no problem with my AFAB body.  But to me, sex and gender are separate.  I accept my body but also accept my body and mind do not align 100%.  Therefore, my gender is nonbinary.  But I don't align myself with Trans identity as my physical state doest cause dysphoria.
That was kinda one of the first indicators for me too!  I didn’t have obvious dysphoria but I’d get a little thrill when someone would call me “they/them” or slip up and accidentally call me sir.  With journaling and self reflection on my past I eventually found more evidence!  You’re totally valid!
Soooo valid - welcome, make yourself at home, would you like a hot beverage? 🥰
It's way worse in my native language, German. 🤢
euphoria is a completely valid indicator. you don’t have to feel dysphoria to be enby!
You don't have to have gender dysphoria to be anything! Always keep that in mind. You're perfectly valid :3
You are entirely valid, despite their not being a non-binary form of Freund. You are valid, welcome, and encouraged to be your authentic self.
It's good that you're not dysphoric, not every trans person goes through that! Thankfully. You are valid no matter if you are far or quite close to gender assigned at birth. Moreover it's ok to take things slow and figure it out as you go. You are valid no matter what. Wish you all the support in the world!!


Also welcome to the family, our enby baby!! 🥳❤️
Honestly I didn’t even know I had dysphoria until I changed my name and pronouns. It can manifest as anxiety and depression. If you have ADHD it might be a gender dysphoria misdiagnosis. That “chill” you feel could be a type of gender dysphoria.
100%

also same, hi
You will always be valid. Enbys have to stick together.
Hi! first of all, same. stuff like ""be a man"" cuts like a knife in the gut    
  
I used to struggle with calling myself an enby because I only focused on what gave me dysphoria, but once I started emphasizing what gives me euphoria (in my case: long hair, looking androgynous in general) it all got clearer and I'm now proud to call myself non-binary ^ ^ hope the anecdote helps you in figuring your identity out, best of wishes and remember that whatever you find out you are, you're valid :3
[deleted]
I feel ya. Don't often have dysmorphia, but I am sick to death of being lumped in with the ""men"".
Here to agree with all of the ""dysphoria is not a prerequisite"" votes.
Some people have dysphoria and don't realize it because it doesn't look like the stereotype. There's been a lot of times where I've been like ""oh, wait, that's dysphoria"" looking back at my life.

&#x200B;

For example ""well, I don't HATE my x, but I'd really prefer if it were y"" is still dysphoria.
Yes. And those definitely don’t sound like feelings a cis person would have.
So valid my dude!
Sounds like social dysphoria to me. Welcome! ❤️
Yeah I feel the same about female ones.
Yes.  Welcome to our weird, dysfunctional family ❤️
I always got this about she and her. It made me feel super uncomfortable as I am not a girl! But I also got called a man sometimes when afab and presenting fully feminine and I also wasnt keen on that. Better but still not it.

So have a think on it :)
Yup, I don't have body dysphoria, and I'm even ok with he/him pronouns, but it doesn't change the fact that I don't feel like a man. Because at the end of the day, the only person who can define your gender identity is.
You don’t need body dysphoria to be nonbinary. Sometimes it’s as simple as somebody gendering you and you going “…..nah.” You are valid!
Thank you so much ^^
100% with you here. I really love my body. I LOVE my vagina. And looking like, talking like, or letting people assume I’m a woman—will still never make me one.
I feel exactly like this! Even to the point where I had to have a mastectomy but opted for reconstruction because I feel my breasts _are_ part of my identity, but they don't necessarily mean I'm a woman.
You don't have to have dysphoria in order to be trans, nor is being trans a prerequisite for dysphoria.
Yes, sex and gender are separate, well said :)
I feel exactly like this, though I’m transfem (that is, I was born on the intersex spectrum, and was AMAB, but am transitioning to an AFAB-like body). Having a male body gave me strong dysphoria, but having one closer to female now doesn’t bother me one bit. I like the way it looks, and plan to have GCS as well ASAP. 

Still, I don’t see what it has to do with my *gender*.  

Having a “trans woman’s body” and being read as female doesn’t make me a woman. I still have zero connection to womanhood or manhood, but am neutral inside—always was, always will be.
Hehe. I love being called a woman too 😛. Though I don't have the guts to accept it publically. Only in safe spaces I wish to be a woman. Like I don't mind being publically as a full woman but it's a bit uncomfortable when people can realise it's a guy dressing up as a woman.
For me, getting super uncomfortable when people called me a woman that was a definite hint that started me on my transition.
Yes, German is tough that way.
Deutsch ist schrecklich für Gender. Alles ist männlich oder weiblich :(. 

(Everything is gendered in German, and it’s awful).
So sweet, thank you 🥺
Hi :)
Thank youuu
Ehm probably 1,80m or 1,85m. Also same, I have a very sensitive and feminine side, but I'm fine with my body, so to say.
Thank u very much ^^
You're welcome! 😊
OMG it makes me so happy to read someone else saying this. I'm afab and I recently realized that being nonbinary actually helps me feel more comfortable with my female body! It has lots of uses for me, it makes me feel good when I use it for sex, it's just not relevant to my gender!!
The opposite for me, but for the rest same
I did not mean to imply dysphoria exists to be Trans, I just know I don't experience my body the same as my Trans friends.

Genderqueer doesn’t always mean dysphoria. I love that my body has created and sustained another human life. I love the curves and lines—no dysphoria here. But I still hate gender roles. I hate the idea of gender. I queer the concept of gender, and that makes me genderqueer.		"> **Genderqueer doesn’t always mean dysphoria.** 

I love that you started with it . Bringing awareness that some doesn't face dysphoria and it's not something unique from our community and shouldn't always be associated with us <3

>  **But I still hate gender roles. I hate the idea of gender. I queer the concept of gender, and that makes me genderqueer.** 

You've voiced me here!
I’m so sorry to hijack your post (you look so happy and I love your hair btw) but I don’t understand the difference between genderqueer and gender nonconforming and you seem like you have a very solid definition; can you explain it to me please?
big same yo
love your hair!!
Same! Except I also have no interest in cutting my hair short or shaving it
well said!

&#x200B;

gender euphoria is a better building block for many trans identities!
I'm AMAB and I can hugely relate. I don't mind most of my male traits and in a lot of ways I do identify with life as a queer/bisexual male. But psychologically and aesthetically I feel like I have an androgynous nature and I don't connect with traditional notions of manliness/masculinity at all. For a long time I felt like I ""wasn't trans enough"" to have an NB identity (maybe can be blamed on baggage from a trans medicalist ex), but after talking to a lot more trans and NB people I've realized that there's no restrictions on how I define myself if it feels authentic.
I’m the opposite. I deal with dysphoria and it’s not fun. But I totally support you and your gender queerness!
Nice haircut. Shaved heads are the best.
Love it! Beautiful!
This right here has been the biggest hurdle in finding a label. When is something just not conforming to gender roles and when is it actually a difference in identity? Especially for those of us with no/low physical disphoria.
I don’t think I have a solid definition lol. I’ve struggled and thought about it for a while. As a teacher, the issue seems forced on me—I have to be called a title, and I hated hearing “Mrs” (gah, I don’t belong to a man!) and Ms. didn’t feel right, but Mx. clicked. So I researched and tried out different labels for what that makes me, and overall just identify with the term “genderqueer” more so than “gender non conforming” because the second one seems too generic. 

 For me, it’s that not only do I do nonconforming things, but I do it out of a belief that gender should have nothing to do with your choices and maybe shouldn’t even exist. I’m human. I want that to be the first thing people notice. Not my gender.

You are absolutely very too kind. I will always be Samara from the ring chic
Hmm sorry you feel that way :(
I used the tape trick, then put back on the foundation that the tape ripped off, and then dragged the wings down a little to make up for the powder that got messed up with the foundation
I never heard of the tape trick
You basically get a piece of masking tape, line it up with your bottom eyeline and it creates kinda a template to do wings, and it makes it come out vry sharp

How to treat crippling dysphoria 101: Buy more flannel, eat lots of cookies, take daily naps, and schedule an appointment to banish your Adam's apple from existence		"Dang, that's an impressive mane you have there! 😍
Sometimes I use turtlenecks and scarves to hide my lack thereof. Side note, you have hair worthy of the shampoo commercials! You must take excellent care of it.

Does cookie dough work in place of cookies if I'm too lazy to bake said dough? Haha. For real though, you look stellar. Your hair is <3

You can...just...send it away?
Super cute!!

Your hair is amazing and also solidarity on the dysphoria <3
Wow!
Can confirm this is an effective strategy for non Adam’s apple-having people too, just substitute  the Adam’s apple banishing for (in my case) contemplating low-dose T and/or a total wardrobe overhaul and/or an undercut. My hair is my darling too so the undercut idea is both appealing and terrifying.
Thank you 💕 My hair really is my darling, and I cherish it a lot!
I tend to wear chokers very often, which can also do the trick. I don't actually take that much care of it. Mild shampoo and conditioner, wash three times a week, rinse with cold water, let air dry, brush daily. That's about the extent of it.
You do you, my friend. I just get mine from the store.

Non-binary tween wants surgery	"Our 12 year old child came out as non-binary 18 months ago, and we fully support them in their journey. I’m struggling with how to help them with their body dysphoria. They want to remove their breasts and not have their period. They don’t feel comfortable masturbating, because it reminds them how much they don’t feel like they were in the right body. 

They are seeing a therapist, but we don’t feel there’s a lot of progress being made, since surgery would be years down the road, and even if we got puberty blockers, that wouldn’t change how they feel being in their own skin. 

It pains us to see our child so conflicted, and we wanted to reach out to the community here for advice. Thanks."	"surgery is unfortunately something they're going to have to wait for, but 12 is still quite early in puberty and puberty blockers might help prevent further changes 

if they don't want a period, certain kinds of hormonal birth control will prevent them (I take the progesterone-only pill) - they can discuss that with a GP and if they have parental consent most doctors will prescribe even to young teenagers

 there are safe, non-surgical cosmetic interventions that a lot of trans masculine (I'm assuming a bit here) people use - a chest binder is a good option if they feel uncomfortable with their chest, for example. feel free to DM me for more specific advice about those, because I've tried most of the options out there :) 

I hope this helps!
Its a little weird to be discussing your pre-teen's masturbation habits with the whole internet but like. Moving on. It would be really hard to get them surgery right now at that age. But talk to their doctor (or find a trans friendly one) about steps you can take, specialists you can see. An endocrinologist would be helpful for figuring out if they'd be a good candidate for puberty blockers, or if you can do something about the periods. Binders are pretty safe these days, specially if you get a good one (I get my son GC2B binders: [https://www.gc2b.co/](https://www.gc2b.co/) ) while they're waiting to be old enough for top surgery.
First of all let me say I'm very, very glad to see parents fully supporting their child. It feels too often like many of us non binary people have been denied this important support in our lives, at least I've seen a lot of people here having unsupportive family.

I'm amazed by the fact there are good people like you still, who want only what is best for their child.

I am not sure however what to suggest, because I found out much later in life that I was non binary. I assume their therapist did some questioning like, are there clothes they feel more comfortable in, are there gender affirming things they feel good doing? A bit of self-care doesn't hurt anyone, either.

As a blind non binary person I struggle a LOT with gender affirming things to do, I mainly try to get gender neutral clothes because maybe it will finally make people pause and not misgender me right out of the blue, but... Yeah. It's a pain to find things that make me feel good and helps with dysphoria. I wish dysphoria could be entirely gone, but I know that will never be possible. Crippling body dysphoria is horrible to go through, and there isn't much to do in my case but to power through it, ride it out until it finally becomes background noise again.

Masturbating, frankly that would have been rather surprising if it helped them, to be honest. It would only make it worse, as it increases the feelings of dysphoria they are experiencing.
start with a good binder (gc2b or spectrum are my favs!) and maybe get them on a birth control to help with periods. also puberty blockers, if possible!!
Can only say that sometimes it takes the right therapist for therapy to help. I went through 14 before I found one that helped. For the rest of it I wish you the best
Gender is one of so many reasons we can be unhappy with our bodies. Gender dysphoria, obesity, disability, alopecia, etc. I’d tell anyone suffering from any of these things this same thing: you’re gonna have the body you want someday, but you don’t have to wait until then to love yourself and BE yourself. And the thing is, it’s kind of a lie. Some people will never lose or gain enough weight, never be able to walk, never grow their hair back, never pass as their true gender. And that’s exactly why you can’t wait to love and be yourself. It takes work but hopefully your child will have a good head start with your help 💙 

I didn’t masturbate until I was 18. It’s okay not to be comfortable exploring that right now. 

Does your child have a group of queer friends? If not, help them find some! It’s SO cathartic to be with people who are not only able to accept you, but also teach you more about who you are. 

I’m so excited for how happy your child will be once they’re able to start this process!!!
I think investigating therapy, puberty blockers, and birth control are all good suggestions. I would also suggest that if, as therapy progresses, your child continues to want surgery, it would be a good idea to make sure they know what the process and healing is like. Not to scare them out of it, but just so they go in with open eyes. Make sure they have all the information so they know what to expect. Until I watched some of my friends experience top surgery, i had no idea about dog ears, or what nipple grafting entails, or what the healing process was like. If you can arrange a conversation between your child and some folks who've had top surgery, they might be able to answer some questions your kiddo might have. Doing this well in advance of when surfery would even become an option could give them a chance to get used to the idea, if it's still something they want or need when the time comes.
Your child does not have body dysmorphia they have gender dysphoria which is a completely different thing. 

When a person has body dysmorphia no matter how thin they get they will see themselves as larger than they really are, or if they are a body builder they will see themselves as being smaller/weaker than they actually are, granted it is very common for trans people to ALSO have eating disorders and a degree of body dysmorphia... however gender dysphoria is different. Just speaking for myself, the shift in hormones prior to my period can cause suicidal inclinations because not only is it a reminder of my birth gender but those changes don't feel like ""me"". Having chest dysphoria means that I don't see myself when I look in the mirror and I feel disconnected from my own body. Over the years this has caused me not to take care of myself the way I should. 

I do (and I think most psychiatrist would probably agree) think puberty blockers may be hugely beneficial for your child. They could reduce the hormonal shifts prior to/during your child's periods and prevent any further breast growth. They won't be able to get cross gender hormones or surgery for a while yet, but that could still help a lot.
Puberty blockers are a good idea, as well as therapy. They probably need a gender counselor.
It can help to know that your body doesn't have to stop you from being yourself, even if you don't like it. That gave me a lot of peace. Also when you're being yourself (in my experience), you see your body in a different light. In the light of who you are. Your body becomes you. You just gotta be completely vulnerable with it. This is just my opinion and I know that many disagree, but looking for yourself primarily in your pshysical body is a fools errand. You wont find yourself. You're looking in the wrong place. Which is obvious to me when I think about it, because who we are, is something that exists in our souls, not our bodies. But again. Once you see yourself, your body will become yours again. There are so many beautiful, passing trans women out there that are completely out of touch with themselves and hate what they see in the mirror.

That however doesn't mean that appearance doesn't matter at all, or that certain parts of your body can't still make you uncomfortable sometimes. But it doesn't have to stop you from being connected to yourself!

I don't really have enough information to know exactly what your child's problem is, so I don't know if I have the solution. I thought I'd just give my own perspective and experience. And I'm not sure that I have all the answers, but the commmon saying around here is that you don't have to have a certain body to be nonbinary. Which I think makes sense with my own experiences.

On the appearance front... I don't know if it seems scary to you, but why not try binders?
Puberty blockers are still a good idea because it will prevent further growth, for now getting a binder and well fitting clothes will help them feel comfortable socially.
Would recommend seeking care with a gender affirming provider with experience treating adolescents.  Blockers would not reverse any body changes that have already happened, but can stop additional pubertal development, and generally stop periods.  Starting cross hormones can be delayed to give time for them to work on therapeutic goals, or can be started in low doses.    


There are multiple options for controlling periods  including options normally used for contraception and raloxifene, which turns off estrogen receptors at the breast and uterus.
It could also be helpful for you both to go to therapy together specifically to help with this conversation (Note: a very Trans *positive* therapist).

Navigating this conversation can be so hard because it can often end up down conversational pathways where your child feels like you're not validating their identity, when from your perspective all you might be trying to say is, ""we should go slow before doing anything drastic.""

A therapist can help your child understand that just because you might say something like, ""I think it's too soon for puberty blockers"" doesn't mean you aren't wanting to be supportive and validating of who they are. And they can help *you* get a better sense of both how to phrase language like that, and how to know what concerns you might have are fair or unfair -- which are okay to raise and which you have to trust your child's own sense of self more in
I think it's great that you're being supportive and trying to get advice from others! I'm 17 and I have been looking into top surgery for the past couple of years. Most top surgeons prefer not to operate on anyone until they complete puberty (about 17/18) because there is a risk of the remaining tissue continuing to grow. Furthermore, most insurance won't cover top surgery until 18, 17 if you sign a bunch of forms. I understand dysphoria (btw not dysmorphia, two very different things) but your better options at the moment are going to be hormone blockers, packing and chest binding, all of which you can do more research on with your kid. I would also recommend speaking with a therapist, not only because it is incredibly beneficial, but also because many surgeons and insurance companies require a letter from a therapist in order to receive any kind of gender affirming surgery. Down the line, having that relationship with a therapist could be super beneficial. (Also please keep in mind all of this information is based of the laws in the state of Colorado, but should mostly apply to America in general)
Please check out [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/xue7es/how_to_bind_a_large_chest_effectively_with/) post, it has info about safe binding that i rarely see anywhere else.
there's plenty of good advice in this thread already, but I just want to say you are clearly doing a *stellar* job as parents if your 12 year old is able to talk to you about not just gender, but masturbation! clearly there's a culture of respect and no judgment there, and if you keep that up, you can't go wrong.
If it's comforting, I used to feel the same way. Over time, with support, it got a little better. I survived waiting, waited a little more, and made a well educated decision as an adult. 

Happy and free now <3
as a healthcare worker i must strongly finding a supportive doctor. From the studies iv read puberty blockers are a great noninvasive option. especially at that age its kind of just holding back puberty till 18 and they can make a surgical decision. its great you are being supportive and thats already the best step.
Idk how BC works for kids but I’m on the pill and haven’t had a period for 3 years and it has been life changing for my dysphoria.
I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for being such a wonderful community. This was my very first post here and my first question on Reddit. I was a bit nervous about the responses I might get, but you are all overwhelmingly supportive, and I feel very grateful for the advice, which I shared with our child. I have contacted their doctor, and he agrees we can explore options to stop their period. I would love to hear more about how puberty blockers have worked for anyone who has experienced them. Also, our kiddo is completely psyched about coming home from school today, because we’re going to measure them and order their first binder. We don’t know any one else going through this process, so it really means a lot to have your gentle encouragement and advice as a community. I feel really grateful. I’m going to try to respond to everyone, and thank you!! You made our day.
Trans tape is a good and safe binding option that is especially good for small chests. You may find interest in the peecock products.
Kids don't really have the ability to internalize that the future can be significantly different from the present. Your kid may have such strong dysmorphia with a kids brain that they simply can't imagine feeling anything else.

Get them a binder, and get them on puberty blockers and then revaluate after everything starts kicking in. When they are 13 (reddit TOS) I'd recommend encouraging them to post here asking about other peoples experiences.

As an ace person I find it a bit weird you know your kid's masturbatory preferences, nevertheless please make sure they know that some people are never comfortable with it and that is okay. Asexuality is normal and everyone can have different reasons for the identity, and all of them are valid. Again when they are 13 r/asexuality would welcome them with open arms.

Edit: some folks are upset I invited someone who is uncomfortable with sexual activity to a sub for people who are uncomfortable with sexual activity. I don't think I will ever understand Reddit.
I would insist using hormone blockers to stop them from going through puberty (if they have not already finished it) as that would be hell for them. It might not help them feel more comfortable in their body but it will stop them feeling more uncomfortable in it. I would also suggest a binder for them. I would  suggest you research binding and find the best binder for your kid. If they are not already seeing a therapist that specializes in trans or LGBTQ+ kids you should look into that. good luck to you and the kid, your gonna need it. <3
Depending on where you live, surgery might require a waiting period.

If they can settle for a binder for until they can get surgery, then the best bet for a binder is to look into gc2b, a trans owned and operated transitional apparel company.

There are also a great many of us who don't trust therapy. If you feel like there's not much progress being made, maybe look into what that therapist might be doing.

Also, you are saying you fully support your kid, but you called their gender dysphoria a kind of body dysmorphia?? The fact that you described it as a dysmorphia is suspicious.
as someone who went through the exact same thing, thank you so, so, so much for supporting them. it means more to them than you'll ever know to have parents that support you for who you are. have they considered getting a chest binder? GC2B is a great place to get safe, comfortable binders in quite a few varieties for about $40 USD each. if they do, binding safely is extremely important but can do a lot to help with chest dysphoria. don't exercise (ESPECIALLY swim) in a binder, don't wear it for any longer than 8-12 hours, and make sure to get one in your size and wash it regularly so it doesn't irritate the skin. ones that zip up or clip are more dangerous because of the way it confines the chest compares to ones you put up over your head. i wish your child luck on their journey, and knowing that they have people so close to them that support them makes me think that they're going to have a much better time with it than i and many others ever did. don't get discouraged if they get depressed from gender dysphoria, it's extremely common and almost inevitable, and as long as you listen to and validate their needs, you're helping them. 💜
Surgery isn’t recommended to kids that young unless it’s very dire but you can talk to an obgyn about birth control options to stop their periods as safely as possible make your you know the side effects though, I was on BC since I was 12 for a different condition and there’s a lot of benefits to be had but many side effects as well including certain food and medication that can effect it. Also dysmorphia and dysphoria are different things so make sure to look those up and ask the therapist about the differences. Then you can also learn about breast binding options and learn how to safely do so if you want to help with no surgical options for the time being, one option is careful use of a tight sports bra but definitely research how to safely do it and not wear it too long. Also there are several groups online for both support for parents of trans and nonbinary kids as well as for non-binary people and youth if you look for ones you’re comfortable with the both of you joining you might be able to make some friends that can give you moral support and point you toward good resources for navigating this stuff. 

The gender dysphoria Bible is one I always suggest [here’s the link to it](https://medium.com/gender-from-the-trenches/gender-dysphoria-isnt-what-you-think-6fdc7ae3ac85)
Puberty typically starts between 11-14 and changes continue to happen until 16-19. If they aren't comfortable with themself right now, puberty blockers are a good option. 

It sounds like they are pretty acutely upset about this, and they can't imagine a future where they are happy without major surgery. 

They will. And you know how important this is to them and you are going to help them. There are so many options available to them in the world, honestly there is no if about it, even if you didn't support them, they are going to get the surgery they want if they put in the work to make it happen. They can do anything they are determined to. But that doesn't mean it's going to be easy and it's not going to happen right at this moment in their life. Getting surgery is worthwhile and the right thing to do even if it is hard and they are going to have to stand up for themself to get what they want. It's important that they can do that.

If they want the help of a surgeon they have to convince a surgeon to trust that they have put in the work before surgery to recover better after surgery than they were before surgery. If they go into surgery to affirm their gender identity while they are an emotional mess about their identity, then they aren't making choices that will lead to a good recovery and a surgeon will wait until they do that work before they intervene.

Surgery is always meant to heal but it is a process that is hard on the body and mind. It's going to involve a lot of suffering. The funny thing is joy is persistent, and if you have emotional resilience, it will exist right along side suffering, especially when you know what you are doing is right.

They are going to need that to get through surgery. They are going to need that to get a surgeon to help them in the first place. Surgery will change their body, but it won't surgically remove their feelings about their body or their memories. How they feel right now in this moment is important. The choices they make right now are going to determine the kind of person they become when they come out of surgery.
yes! I have an the merina iud and I get like a tiny bit of spotting like once or twice a year I love it sooooo much. Periods were always very dysphoric times for me and it didn't help that it was a week of pms + 8-9 days of heavy bleeding, I always needed a tampon and a pad at the same time or else it would bleed through :/ birth control pills made a lot of things worse for me, but the iud lasts 7 years and it just such a godsend!!! Highly recommend!
You made some great suggestions that we are absolutely taking you up on. I appreciate how carefully you worded your assumption about our child being possibly trans masculine. It seems like they are following a spectrum of clothing options, sometimes wearing super masc clothing (button-downs, cargo pants, suit jackets, ties), and other times it’s femme kawaii dresses that they pair with a masc item. They love anime, so that is sometimes the inspiration. Even in a dress, however, they would prefer to be flat on top, so I think you’re right: the chest binder is probably a good place to start. I’m wondering if that would be something they could wear to school, since there is a daily PE class and nobody changes clothes before/after. It’s my understanding just from the limited bit that I read that you wouldn’t really want to exercise with it on. Is that your experience, too? Thank you so much for also inviting me to DM you. I will drop you a line soon!
this!!! i started the pill when i was 15 because my cycle was horrid (7+ days and debilitating cramps) and it made things a lot better, but as an adult i asked my gyno if i could just skip my placebo pills. they said yes since its pretty safe, and to just let them know if i had problems. i haven’t had a real period in almost a year, only some spotting here and there.
Thanks for the link! GC2B looks like an awesome site. We will definitely order one from there. And I think you’re right, the doctor would be able to tell if they are a good candidate for puberty blockers. 

I do have to apologize to everyone for tossing out the masturbation comment without prefacing that we, as a family, talk to our kids about their bodies in a sex-positive way. We discuss consent from a very early age, in terms of what you are OK with – you might not want a hug from grandma, for instance – and that builds to a deeper understanding of consent when they are tweens and teens. We bought them books on sex that were age-appropriate, talking about the differences in bodies, etc. There are so many awesome inclusive resources now for kids that talk openly about sex and gender identity. And yes, the books and our talks, sometimes do include masturbation. We see that as a healthy and normal exploration of their bodies in private. Sometimes they have questions, and we want to encourage them to talk with us rather than asking a friend at school who may not know and give them the wrong advice. I hope that makes sense to you, and I’m really sorry that I didn’t give that more context in my question. In my defense, this was my first time ever writing a question on Reddit, and I will do better next time! Thanks for clueing me in. I’m still laughing at your “…but like. Moving on.” I can see how you might think it sounded perverted, but I assure you, it’s not.
Here’s a link to one of my favorite authors and his new book, which we, of course, have: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1644210800/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?ie=UTF8&qid=&sr=
I'm not even sure if they should be talking with their pre-teen about masturbation at all.
okay as a blind person, I feel like you can imagine the horribly awkward time I had with my (blind, trans) son, trying to teach him how to use trans/KT tape. No one makes audio described ""how to bind safely with tape"" videos lol.
Thank you so much for the names of your favorite binders! Last night I was using your advice and looking at those two websites. They both look great! Do you tend to prefer the full length binders or the half binder? We are definitely going to talk to the doctor about birth control and puberty blockers. I just scheduled an appointment for after New Year’s for them. Thank you for the suggestions!!
Aren’t binders bad for kids? Their bones are still growing.
That has been our experience as well. What was your approach in finding a therapist that specializes in gender identity? We’ve found the pool of therapists really limited, because we’re also looking for pediatric gender identity. Sadly, yesterday, when our child had their weekly talk with their therapist, she had no clue what a binder was and had to ask our child to explain. In her defense, she is a new graduate and still learning the ropes and probably does not have a lot of connection to the LGBTQ+ community. This is our third therapist. When I told our kid that you had 14 therapists before you found a good fit, they made this face 😳 and then threw up their hands in exasperation.
Your response really touched my heart. It was really wise, because most of us struggle with not loving our bodies at some point, or we are always thinking things will be better if I just lose 5 pounds/grow my hair/have some medical procedure. We try to teach our kids about loving their bodies just as they are. One of our relatives is especially triggering, since they comment on other peoples bodies frequently in negative ways, and we are teaching our kids to say, it’s not OK to talk about other people’s bodies that way. Like all of us, some days are better than others with our child accepting their body. I am a curvy goddess, so I try to model for our kids that I love my body and I exercise to make my body feel good inside, etc. Hopefully they will love themselves with time.

Can I also say thank you for being so vulnerable and saying that you didn’t masturbate until you were 18? I showed your post to our kiddo, and they had a little sigh of relief, saying I’ve got time to figure this out. As a parent, I can say things, and they hear me, but sometimes having an outside perspective of someone who’s been there can really help them. So thank you for that.

Now the next part: no, our child doesn’t have a group of queer friends, and they desperately want some. There is one lesbian kid they hang out with at school, but that’s it. We had joined a group called Gender Spectrum that does weekly meetings for non-binary tweens, which sounds perfect, except for the fact that they’re not allowed to exchange contact information, and they’re encouraged to talk about typical kid interests outside of gender identity. We’re not sure how to meet other queer friends for them. We live in SoCal, so there are lots of queer resources in the city…I just don’t know how to find in-person social stuff for them.
This is fantastic advice. Surgery is going to depend heavily on what their body is like as an adult, so obviously not on the table for several years at least. But it’s a big deal and worth knowing details about early enough to get comfortable with the realities. Also might be relevant to if/how/how often to bind, etc, since that can have an effect on surgery later. 

As to the rest of it, well. Here’s the thing. Dysphoria isn’t going to just go away. Not anytime soon and maybe not ever, not all the way. There are things you can do to make it better—birth control, wearing clothes you feel real in, having people around who see you for your real self instead of whatever awful fuckery your body is doing. But sometimes the best thing a loved one can do is sit with you and pat your back and remind you “I know it sucks. It sucks a lot. But you’re a tough, strong little dude and you can carry it. And you don’t gotta carry it alone, cause Im with you and I love you, no matter what.”
That is such a wise and forward-thinking comment! Yes, they definitely don’t know all that surgery entails for sure. What are dog ears? Now you’ve got me wondering! I love the idea of having our child talk to other people who have had top surgery, because that could help them understand and make their decision as they get older.
Thank you so much for correcting me. I didn’t get it right the first time. I don’t know if I wrote it wrong or it auto corrected, but you were absolutely right: I meant to say gender dysphoria, not body dysmorphia. They are two totally different things. I will make sure to be more careful with my words next time.

That must feel so heavy when you have that shift in hormones prior to your period. Have you talked to a doctor about it? Especially if you have suicidal feelings, you should ask for their advice. What you said about looking in the mirror and feeling disconnected from your own body is :exactly: what our child expresses all the time. They say it’s like looking at someone else. Last week, they described it to me as imagine I know that I am a woman, but I walk to the bathroom in the morning and see a man looking back in the mirror. It’s that jarring. Is it helpful for people with body dysphoria to cover up mirrors? I’m not sure how I could help with this.
Yes, on both counts! What’s tricky is that there aren’t as many gender counselors available as I had hoped. Finding an appropriate counselor who takes our insurance is a challenge! One gender counselor we had could only see us once every 6 to 8 weeks, and that wasn’t working at all. We have a new therapist now, but she doesn’t seem well-versed on what it means to be non-binary. In fact, our child and I were joking last night in a joking/not joking way that you all on this thread provided better support and advice than the actual therapist they are seeing. Time to get another new one!
You would make a great philosopher! I see what you mean. I think it will probably take years for our child to get to that point, where they are able to disassociate their feelings about their body from their sense of self. As one of our younger kids would say, that’s the boss level. What’s actually helping them enjoy their body these past few months is taking a dance class five days a week. They were never a dancer before this, and it was something they wanted to try, and it gives them a lot of confidence in seeing what their body can do. Beyond the physical, I try to encourage them in their creative pursuits because they are incredibly, outstandingly creative. And may be from that creativity, they can grow a deeper understanding and acceptance of who they are. That’s just gonna come with time.
That’s a good point. I really wasn’t considering puberty blockers before this post, but now I’m thinking it’s going to be essential so that they don’t grow larger breasts which will exacerbate their gender dysphoria. Smart thinking! Thank you.
Thank you for explaining the medical side in detail so we understand what we’re asking for and thanks supporting us. It’s been a real challenge to find a gender affirming provider with experience treating adolescents who is also available weekly and takes Kaiser insurance. We are looking for a unicorn!
We have so many wise people on this thread! This is my new favorite sub Reddit! 😁 You would make a good therapist yourself, because that is exactly what our child’s first therapist told our child and me. One year ago we were navigating a really dark time when our child had come out as nonbinary at school, and five different male classmates on a weekly basis were physically violent. One week, one would smack our child across the face hard enough to leave a hand prints or another one would punch them in the stomach in the lunch line. And the frustrating thing was that no real punishments happened as a consequence. We tried again and again to work with the school administration which ultimately let us down and we chose a new school for our child, which was another microtrauma leaving friends behind and being a new kid midway through the school year. Our child still has panic attacks from time to time as a result of that abuse. It’s some thing we’re working on with two separate therapists, theirs and mine. And that’s an addition to the gender dysphoria stuff we are working on as well. You’re absolutely right in saying that as a parents I have to be really mindful of my language going forward with our child as they navigate these changes. It’s a huge lot of information to learn and take in, and I so appreciate your help and everyone’s help on this thread. It means a lot to me.
I can’t thank you enough for sharing your perspective, especially as someone who is 17 and a few years down the road from us in the process. You are very consistently researching and planning for your top surgery, and I’m really proud of you. That takes a lot of dedication and bravery to do something new. I thank you also for the advice - hormone blockers, chest binding, and letter from a therapist. What is packing? I haven’t heard that term before.
Thank you so much for including this link! That was really helpful.
You! That was very sweet. I am very humbled by your comment. We have a very open household where we talk about everything, much to the consternation of some of our classmates’ parents! 😆 in first grade, our non-binary child was asked to write on a topic they were an expert on. The first step was to do bubble cluster prewriting. Every kid was asked to say aloud what they were an expert in and what their cluster words/phrases were. I got a call from the angry teacher who said our kiddo said they were an expert in sex (I only barely managed to stifle a laugh), and their cluster words were consent, love, adult, men, women (they didn’t know about gender identities then), and babies. I was just so proud their first cluster word was consent! 

You are right in saying that we try to cultivate a culture of respect and no judgment. Thanks for noticing. ☺️ No one ever talked to me about masturbation growing up, but that’s not how we roll. It’s not something we discuss :all: the time, ha! But I’ll check in with our kids to see if they have any questions. Our oldest is midway through high school, and he knows exactly where we have condoms in case he or his friends ever need them. We try to view sex as a natural part of life, and while we prefer they wait until after graduating high school, that’s not always within our control, so we give them information and smart options.
You sound like you are in a contented emotional space now. I’m so happy you could patiently wait and make a decision that reflected who you are.
Thank you for providing a medical perspective! We have a wonderfully supportive pediatrician, so we are in good hands there. We will see him in a few weeks and discuss some non-surgical options. Like you said, the first and best thing is just being supportive of our child. Thanks for chiming in!
Oh, that’s wonderful! I am so happy for you! Our child would be over the moon if we can get to that point. Crossing fingers!
""because it reminds them how much they don’t feel like they were in the right body"" ...I dont think there is anything in this post that specifically points to them being asexual.
Thank you for writing from an ace perspective! You’re right that the future can be significantly different from the present. It’s a journey we just have to be patient with. Thanks for the reminder. 

You know, we’ve talked about the possibility that they might be asexual. They are still quite young, so it’s hard to say for certain. Only time will tell! But they know that it’s totally fine to be ace, that we love and accept them no matter what.

I can understand, especially from an asexual perspective, how it might be perceived as disturbing that we talk with our child about masturbation. I tried to address that in an earlier reply in this chain. Our perspective is that we talk about everything related to their body, head to toe, and we try to give them information by, for example, calling body parts by their real names. My grandmother who raised me hilariously used to tell me during bathtime as a small child to “wash my whose-it and my what’s-it.” Good grief! In checking in with our children, I don’t mean I’m asking about their sexual fantasies - I am asking on a practical level, hey, do you have any questions about your body? Do you need me to get you birth control? Can we talk about STIs? The more knowledge we give them about their bodies, the more they can feel in control of them. Hopefully that makes a little more sense – I know I didn’t really preface my masturbation remark, which was my error! I will know better next time. And thanks for the link - If our child ends up being ace, when they are 13+, I am totally sending them your way on the ace subreddit!

I also want to say, it sounds like they think who they are is ultimately determined by their body, but that's not true, if it was they wouldn't be able to feel this way in the first place. It sucks and their suffering is real but they /are/ trans and nonbinary in the body they are in right now, and they can't do much about their body at the moment, and right now is when they exist, not some future date when they've had surgery, so they can't waste this moment. That's part of what I mean about joy and suffering happening at the same time, they don't need to disregard the bad right now to choose to also spend time sometimes turning towards what makes life worthwhile. They can absolutely take charge of who they are by not settling for less than being spoken to respectfully, dressing how they want, and doing what they want regardless of gendered expectations (within reason) and that is going to attract the people who can recognize them for who they are, body and all.
Mirena is a lifesaver for me.

Germany only allows it for 6 years of use though. Wonder why there's a difference, it's the same IUD. And it only got upped to six in 2021, before that it was five years only!

Anyway, not having your period is the freaking best and even though I had an awful time with insertion, I wish I'd gotten it sooner and spared myself hospitalisation, pain and dysphoria.
Agree with the merina. I have had it for close to 5 years, and I haven’t had a period yet (except for the bit of spotting in the first month) makes me feel just that little bit more valid
After my first kid was born I didn’t get my period for two years. Fan freaking tastic. My second is 14 months and it’s still holding out. Unexpected perk but 10/10 would recommend. (The not having a period I mean)
That’s really helpful to know about the merina IUD. I have only ever used birth control pills, so I didn’t have any experience with that. It would be wonderful for our child to only have spotting once or twice a year. When I read to them your comments, they were hugely excited: you mean I could only have it once or twice a year?!? Yazzzz!!
That is so rad that your kid is exploring a wide range of clothing options. Sounds like they have cool style!

Speaking purely from my own experience of wearing gc2b binders, it would be very uncomfortable (and potentially dangerous) to exercise with one on. For me, wearing a binder (even one that fit well) restricted my ability to inhale deeply and also restricted my upper body movement.

When I was younger and didn't have access to binder options, I would bind using sports bras and felt really comfortable and safe like that. I also called them ""binders"" and the people in my life did too and that felt really affirming. That could be a viable option for PE days, especially under exercise clothes your kid feels good in.
no no no not perverted at all! my household is the same way, it just threw me off to see it, because if my parent posted about my happy fun alone time or lack thereof, I'd probably curl up and die lol.
Not perverted at all. 

I totally took your post as reaching out for help from an INFORMED and supportive way. 

Folks that feel otherwise are having their own stuff triggered.

I wish my parents would have been more open and we had different language when I was a child.

You are on track. 💓
Kids actually are self exploring at a very young age. Totally normal and healthy to explore their body.
Why not? It’s a perfectly normal and natural thing that most kids need information about. Like with any sex talk it should be included.
If you don't prepare them for growing into a sexual being, you shouldn't be surprised when they make a mess of clothes and hide things...
It’s definitely normal to privately discuss it with them to prepare them for anything they may do/feel. It definitely would’ve helped me had my mother talked about it, even just saying it exists, but instead I had to learn from the internet which is not a good place tbh.
Sounds like a gap you and your son might be able to help fill if you feel comfortable doing that at some point! What a great resource it would be!
Damn yes. I still don't know how to bind :(
wow, thanks for the reply! i think it's great that you guys have already scheduled something for birth control/puberty blockers.
Concerning to binders, i enjoy the half binder size, but i know the racer back type is definitely better if you want to exercise (very lightly), and lets you have very good arm movement. 

i really just choose the half because it has a bit better compression than the racerback (from my experience), and the full length just is harder to put on and more noticeable. 
Hope this helps!!
Nope  as long as they measure up every now and then to make sure they are still in the right size.
My approach actually was just to keep changing therapist till I found one I liked. It's not as much about what they're pros in more than it's about the patients connection with the therapist. It literally just trying new places and people until you feel comfortable
That is not optimal, and in the absence of a better option I would ask that therapist to do some required research. But I would also say that the therapist doesn't necessarily do more than she's capable of, there are mentored youth groups for trans kids, in person and online to help.
Until i had a friend who opted to go for it, I had no idea that sometimes nipple grafting just straight up Does Not Work! Like, they'll do the graft, and sometimes it just falls off!
You have such a good heart. That’s really good advice, just realizing that the dysphoria isn’t going to magically disappear overnight. From such an early age, our child expressed their gender dysphoria. Being raised as a then-girl, they said, “Mama, I am a boy-girl! I’m not a girl!” And, silly me, I thought they were saying they were a tomboy, which I definitely was growing up. And looking back, I can see how they were so consistently telling me who they were and that they didn’t entirely feel comfortable in their body. And I wish as a parent that I could take that feeling away, but I can’t, and they will be who they are. And it totally does suck sometimes, and other times, like the school dance, they can throw on a dress and combat boots and a bad ass leather vest and feel on top of the world. Like you said, all you have to say is, we are there, and we love you for who you are, however you decide to present yourself to the world.
Ok so dog ears are extra skin flaps that happen when the flesh doesn't line up exactly after the breast tissue has been removed. It can happen with any plastic surgery, but I hear about it most from top surgery and mastectomies (probably due to my social circle, to be fair). They can be unsightly, they can trigger dysphoria, and they can even be itchy or painful- or they can be just fine. Every person is unique, as is their surgical outcome. You can usually have a revision done to fix the dog ear if it's too bothersome, but that's another surgery, and another recovery period, and it may or may not be covered by insurance, so it might be another bill. So lots of people have revisions, but also lots of people don't bother. It can be a long processntongrt to where you want to be, but I definitely think having knowledge about the road ahead and their options and possibilities will give your child a sense of control. 

I don't know what resources you have available to you locally, but if a schol or library near you has any sort of GSA or LGBT group, they might be able to help you figure out where to get started with research. and they might be able to help connect you with people willing to talk about their experiences with surgery. Librarians in genedal are awesome at connecting people with information and other people, so even if there's no LGBT-specific programming there, it's probably still worth asking at your local library.
I have found having less mirrors in the house is absolutely helpful, although wearing gender reaffirming clothing like binders, button downs, etc is also very very helpful. 

Unfortunately as a single parent I don't have the money to access the healthcare I need right now, so my own needs have had to be put on the back burner just so we can survive financially.  I also can't take hormonal bc because that actually makes things worse, so T would be the best option for me but isn't easily accessible for me at this time. It's been a real struggle, but I've also learned how to deal with a lot of this stuff with mindful meditation and other coping mechanisms.
Thinking about your body in terms of what it can do, instead of what it is metaphysically has also helped me a ton. There's a lot of natural compassion that comes when you let go of the idea that your body has to be this or that or anything entirely. You're able to connect with a sense of wholeness and vulnerability! I use my body to walk, climb, pee, cum (yes), cuddle etc., and we don't have to force any labels on it which is just liberating. So dancing sounds great! 

I wanna also say, that while understanding how this process of your body becoming your own exactly works is difficult, you can still experience being vulnerable in front of the mirror, and thus seeing yourself. It's not something you have to understand to experience. So while I don't know where exactly your childs issue lies, you might consider whether they struggle with the same thing I struggled with, namely being vulnerable – letting everything that goes on on the inside be on the outside as well. That's what healed me.  


>they don’t feel like they were in the right body.

This, to me, does potentially signal some sort of disconnect, that could be healed emotionally, and then if they continue wanting surgery, by all means do it:) It's my experience that the sense of your body being wrong comes from feeling out of touch with yourself and not that your body is in any way innately wrong (although you can still dislike certain aspects of it).

Again. I don't know your child. Maybe they don't have that problem at all, and the solution lies elsewhere.. I'm just sharing what I learned from my experiences:))
Glad we could help!  Feel free to message us - we may know of someone in your area or can point you to some resources.  Thanks for being supportive!  It really does make a huge difference.
this is so good <3 I wish my parents had done this!
>They don’t feel comfortable masturbating

I think we read a different post.
That was the most wholesome thing I have ever read thank you for sharing! I grew up in a very cold abusive household so I know I have biases and I'm always learning what real healthy families look like. Oh also I think disturbing is too strong a word, I just felt a little weird. Though do keep in mind that this sub is public and anyone on the internet can see this post, sometimes reddit starts feeling too safe to me and I have to remind myself.

It is definitely way to early to call your kids sexuality, but there are lots of folks on the ace subs in the same situation as your kid. I've read posts from all kinds of people experiencing dysmorphia that affects their relationship with sex, esspecially folks who haven't been able to have surgery yet. The ace subs I'm on have been some of the most accepting subs I've ever been on, and they are extremely inclusive. I'm having trouble explaining it, but what most people think of as ""asexuality"" isn't the majority on these subs.
God, my heart goes out to you, it is so hard growing up trans and it is so hard raising a trans child to believe in themself and love themself and stand up for themself when that's not what they're hearing from other people in their life. They are worth it though, and I appreciate what it is your doing with them.
huh weird! I got mine in late 2018 I believe, and they told me it was recently found out they're good for 6 years. Had my pap a couple months ago and my doctor said they're saying they're actually good for 7 now so it might be pretty recent that that's what they're going with! Yeah the insertion wasn't great but was basically like a gnarly period cramp for me, so having that for a couple minutes is definitely a good trade off for years of period cramps imo! :)

I'm in the US btw

edit just looked online and one site said it's good for up to 8 years :o but FDA says 7
I was also worried about how much discomfort it would be to insert the IUD. is there anything we can do to minimize that? I wonder if there is some kind of anti-anxiety medicine you can take prior to the insertion. Our child uses period panties because tampons were uncomfortable and  increased their feeling of dysphoria. It’s fantastic that you can have an IUD for so long. I did not know any of that, so thank you for sharing!
this is likely due to the belief that long term use of hormonal birth control increases your risk of certain cancers, however different studies say different things, and the general consensus is that birth control can increase the risk of breast and cervical cancers, but may actually *decrease* your risk of ovarian and uterine cancers.
I think I read that only 10-20% of people don't bleed anymore with hormonal IUDs? Or am I wrong about that? Would love to yeet my period, but I have a copper IUD that I'm truly happy about and it's the first birth control that I don't get any side effects from, so I'm not sure if I should try the hormonal one just for *maybe* not bleeding anymore
awesome that makes me happy :)
Where did I say a 12 year old masturbating is wrong? That literally is not what I said.
It IS a perfectly normal and natural thing for kids to need information about or be curious about.

It IS NOT perfectly natural thing for a child to discuss with their PARENTS. 

Parents and children need to have boundaries especially when it comes to discussing things like masturbation and sexual activity. At this age, most children have already started asking for privacy around their bodies and engaging in these activities without telling their parents or having any kind of outside influence is the beginning of establishing bodily autonomy. When parents pry into their children's masturbation activities and early sexual experiences with their peers, they're not only denying them the privacy that they really need at this age, they are also engaging in activity that sets that child up to be groomed by another adult. 

There are books and other things out there specifically designed for pre-teens and teens to make sure they engage in these activities safely and tell an adult when they experience inappropriate behavior from their peers or other adults.
Starting at the age of around 8, which coincides with the first signs of puberty most children actually WANT privacy around their bodies. This is the beginning of a child becoming an adult, experiencing things on their own without their parents influence or permission. This is very important for normal development. There is nothing wrong with a child making a ""mess"" in their clothes or hiding things they don't want their parents to see because they desire privacy at this age. BTW, most 12 years olds can use a washing machine.
There are age appropriate books that have been written about this for children. 

A parent and a child shouldn't be discussing this in any great detail it is violating their privacy and could even be considered a form of emotional incest, as usually most people only talk about these things with their spouse or partner and sometimes not even then.
That is super helpful! Thank you for explaining how you chose your binder. I was thinking of a half binder because our child sometimes gets stomach upsets from too much acid, and I wondered if a full length finder might put more pressure on their stomach and increase that feeling. I really appreciate you explaining how movement works with a regular binder versus a racer back, because that was a consideration I wasn’t even aware of. See, there’s always a learning curve whenever you’re taking in something new, so I can’t tell you all how much I appreciate this advice. We have seriously the best subreddit!
thanks for saying something helpful. I don’t know why I’m getting downvoted for asking a question.
OK, now you’ve just given me nightmares!! 😂
I get it. My kiddo is also nb, and its hard to watch them go into situations that you know are gonna hurt, or to have to teach them how to navigate situations that might be difficult or dangerous. It’s scary and awful to watch your kid go through scary awful things, and its really hard to know what’s right for them. But like. That’s the job, isn’t it? The parents of straight/cis/neurotypical/whatever kids don’t worry less about those kids, not if they love them. You just gotta do your best for the kid you’ve got and try to love and support them wherever they are, right?
I love the thoughtfulness that you put into this response. Yes, that kind of grounding technique, where you think about all of the functions your body performs for you admirably well, can be helpful as a pathway to accepting the body. And I think that kind of thought process is really helpful to people even beyond the nonbinary realm. So many people have body acceptance issues. I know I certainly did growing up! My grown-ups were incredibly weight conscious, and they even offered me diuretics and Metamucil as a quick way to lose weight as a teen, which I had declined. I have tried to remind our child that they love the dance class they’re taking this year, and their body performs so well during these really complicated moves, and that is giving them a lot of confidence. I’m hopeful that as they get older, they will start to have some of the same thought processes as you had expressed here: Having natural compassion for your body, embracing your vulnerability, not forcing labels on it. As you say, only time will tell whether or not the dysphoria changes, and they have about six years before they could potentially get surgery at the earliest. I really appreciate you writing and offering your perspective. It’s been very reassuring in hearing from everyone here - I’m hopeful for the first time in a while that we might have our child in a more relaxed mindset from all these great suggestions.
Well, same! I didn’t grow up with this, either. But the great thing is that if you end up being a parent or a mentor someday, you can be the kind of parent you wish you had. You already seem like an open and abundantly kind person who is emotionally intelligent. So somehow you ended up great!
asexual = not experiencing sexual attraction 
desire doesn't have to play a role it's person based :)
No, you just stopped before the end of the sentence and missed out on pertinent information.
Not feeling comfortable masterbating in this context is clearly relating to dysphoria. I was unable to until I had lower surgery this year - I’m definitely not asexual. However, did mistakenly think I was as a teen due to misunderstandings around asexuality and dysphoria
Well fuck now I'm sad I don't work at the gyn ward anymore, I could've asked all the doctors and heard probably 10 different answers. 😂 

My uterus is a hostile creature that decided to wage war on the intruder, so the whole day of insertion was BAD. Fainting, shaking in pain, throwing up and sleeping in my clothes bc I couldn't change out of them bad. Still worth it though, because my uterus was also hostile during normal times and really needed to stfu.
>Turbulent

(Not medical advice, speaking from personal experience, etc. etc.)

Yes, oftentimes folks are prescribed a one-time dose of a benzodiazepine shortly before IUD insertion. There is also a ton of anecdotal evidence online that people will take an NSAID (ibuprofen, diclofenac) or acetaminophen beforehand to help with post-insertion cramping. However, I honestly don't know what the pediatric recommendations are, so this would be something to talk to the GP about.

Period panties are a GREAT option, e.g. stores like TomboyX, [period.co](https://period.co), etc.

You seem like a really thoughtful parent and your kid is lucky to have you!!
Another option is also the depo Provera shot
You could always try going on the progesterone only pill alongside the copper coil. I was on the pair for about a year. My doc said that if the progesterone pill stops you bleeding then the merina coil will too because they work in a similar way.
From a quick google that sounds about right I think? I must just be incredibly lucky. It’s use is meant to decrease it significantly making periods much lighter and less painful. Everything is worth a shot! You may try it and it doesn’t work out, like everything, it’s trial and error :)
I still bleed with a Mirena. It’s my second one (first time was Mirena + visanne so no periods at all). 
We are only ‘allowed’ them for 5 years (like, what will the docs do, arrive at my house and force it out? Idk) but I had my first one removed after 4 years. Then reinserted less than a year later. It was done in hospital because I had 3 failed insertions in Drs room (you’ll climb through the wall it hurts so bad). This time, I definitely have more breast pain. I’ve never dealt with breast pain and I started my period at 10. I’ve gained weight and have been told I now have a ‘woman’s figure’. So in terms of dysphoria, a hormonal IUD could make it worse. 

My mum had a hormonal IUD (not Mirena, idk what it was) but she bled so much and so heavily for about 3 months, so they took it out.  It very much depends on the individual.
What was your point then?

I understand your comment to say: OP shouldn’t be talking about masterbation with their preteen.

If that’s not what you meant, can you clarify?

Self touch and exploration is normal, so i don’t understand why it’s inappropriate to talk about.
Privacy: yes

Leaving them entirely to their own devices during a tumultuous formative period of their life: the fuck?
Yeah, no problem!! It really inspires me seeing such an accepting and determined parental figure out here :) i wish you and your kid the best!! :)
Folks are easily triggered. Don’t take it personally.
thank you! sadly, I will never have children. I settle for imparting little nuggets of wisdom and acceptance to the children I meet.
The sub is for more than just the dictionary definition of ace. Lots of folks are on that sub are actually there just to receive support for being low/no sex individuals in a hyper sexual society.

There are many posts from eggs who leave the sub when they crack, because they realized they felt asexual while they had the wrong gender identity.

I don't have any interest in policing why a person can join a sub. If OPs 12 year old child is experiencing low to no interest in masturbation then they are welcome there.
Considering how many eggs are on the ace subs, who leave when they crack. No, I don't think I missed any information.
I've read posts from lots of people who are just like you as a teen on the ace subs. I think a safe place to explore your identity without judgement is important. The sub I linked has been that safe place for me.
yikes that's rough! Glad you're through it hopefully it doesn't happen again with the next one 🤞
Medical advice (real one!): Benzodiazepine can cause a very paradox reaction, making a person extremely agitated and even aggressive. That is more common than most people outside of hospital healthcare would think, but it can be *bad*.

That one I know from experience, because I used to be claustrophobic and they gave me one before an MRI. I have never in my life been that angry and awake, and I can get angry on my own just fine.

So if you ever get one before a procedure that you're awake for, wait until it kicked in and made you tired, because mine hit right when I was in the MRI and it was awful, because I had full awareness, even more than usual, and had to suffer through it.
Oh, thanks for the info! That way I could try the effects first, that sounds great! I'll definitely bring it up with my gyn
Yeah, not so easy for me, because due to some anatomical stuff I have to get IUDs under general anesthetics, so that would mean two unnecessary anesthetics if it does not work for me. But I'll try testing the progesterone pill first as someone else suggested :)
I am also unfortunately one of those people who bleeds on everything, and every birth control I've taken has made me super emotional. I'm glad it works for some folks but birth control was an absolute nightmare for me. Haven't tried an iud but after the depo shot, I don't want anything I can't immediately stop taking. I was told the depo shot had like an 80% chance of stopping my period entirely, so I was like ""awesome that's exactly what I want"", and then I bled for 3 months straight and was depressed and crying all the time .-. So now it's been years since I've taken any birth control, and even the hormones my body just has make me feel like a crazy person when I'm pmsing. I actually have an appointment today with a specialist and I hope that they can refer me to a surgeon for a hysterectomy. I never wanted to have a period and I hope some day soon I can see that arsehole of an organ in a biowaste bag
>‘woman’s figure’

Ugh, no thanks. 

I can also only get them under general anesthetics in the hospital. Still worth it imo. 

I have a lot of breast pain even without taking hormones for 1-2 weeks per month, I feel you, it sucks.
Um just because something is normal, doesn't mean it is normal to talk about WITH YOUR PARENTS.

Setting boundaries between yourself and your child when it comes to talking about sex is healthy and important. Especially if you're the one asking as a parent questions about your teens masturbation or sexual habits. Due to the power imbalance they might not feel completely comfortable talking about this stuff with you but feel like they have to because you're in a position of authority over them. That isn't okay.
People should be left to their own devices when it comes to masturbation. 

It is not something they need to be discussing with their parents or any other adult as a 12 year old child, other than maybe a therapist as this relates to gender dysphoria. There are many age appropriate books that discuss this topic. Any adult who is talking to a child about their masturbation habits, sexual attraction, sexual fantasies, is crossing a very serious boundary. It is okay to have privacy and keep somethings to yourself/for them to be personal and private. Normalizing a child discussing these things with an adult, even a parent, is opening them up to be groomed by other adults. 

Again, this is something many people only discuss with their sexual partners and sometimes not even then. Which is okay. It is okay to keep an aspect of your sexuality just to yourself and for yourself, to not share that with other people.
my bad, some of the ace subs are kinda weird. wasn't trying to gatekeep or police anything, when they're of age ofcs they're welcome wherever !!
Oh, it will. Still worth it though 😂

Being hospitalised in your own hospital, in a room with your own breast cancer patients, for *having your period too hard*, is not my cup of tea and avoiding that shit is worth a LOT of pain to me. Especially since it's only around 2 days at most that suck.
Gosh that sounds rough. I hope you find something that works for you!
I also got a lot of psychological side effects with hormonal birth control. I have troubles controlling my emotions even in my ""natural"" state but on the pill I went from being depressed to crying to being angry and agressive and so on... 

Copper IUD is the first birth control I'm happy with, maybe it would be worth a shot for you?

Only downside, I still get periods.
Yeah….. that’s not how parenting works. 

If you can’t talk openly about sexual health from a young age, you’re doing it wrong. Finding ways to support your child’s health and education starts very young. Hiding and avoiding it causes gaps in information, understanding, and only compounds as they get older.
And this is exactly what OP is doing. Supporting their child. 

So good in them. Im glad that kid has a parent that is willing and open to having this conversation.
> opening them up to be groomed

I can't tell if you're ignorantly falling for this narrative or if you're secretly a chud, but this line is how I know you aren't to be taken seriously.

Talking with your children about these things, before someone else does, is how you *protect* them from strangers.
wow yeah that's gnarly! glad you don't have to deal with it anymore!
Thanks! :)
The tries without GA were definitely rough, maybe even traumatic... But with it it's totally fine, get sleepy, wake up fine, no worries about unwanted pregnancy for the next 5 years, worth it! :)
I've been parenting for 16 years I think I know how it works thank you. 

There is a difference between talking openly with your child about sexual health from a young age and not respecting their bodily autonomy/right to privacy when it comes to these issues, which, this parent is clearly violating as they are talking about their 12 year old child's issues with masturbation online.
It is not supportive of their child to talk about their issues with masturbation online. 

This is a 12 year old CHILD. It is okay and even necessary to have boundaries with your children when it comes to them talking about sexual activity they are engaging in.
I'm a survivor of grooming and CSA. 

CSA most commonly occurs with a trust adult. When a parent starts asking their child for detailed information about the masturbation or sexual habits that makes the child think, oh, it is okay for me to talk about these things with other trusted adults. It normalizes that behavior, which opens the child up to be groomed. 

Parents should be talking to their child about consent, appropriate and inappropriate behavior, as well as setting boundaries between themselves and their children when it comes to sexually inappropriate conversations. These boundaries are normal, appropriate and protective.
I felt so freaking silly being there. 😅 I didn't even want to go.

Also thanks, and glad to hear that it's working well for you, too. It's quite nice to talk about this side of healthcare with other nonbinary people. I usually only get to do that with my cis friends, and I feel like they only see the physical side of how awesome it is to not bleed out every month. But the psychological benefits are so much better.

I feel like my body is finally more mine. Like it's not acting against my will anymore. I feel better about every aspect of myself, just because of a tiny piece of medicated plastic. And that's amazing, but they don't really get how amazing it is.
It’s not a violation of anyone’s privacy. No one knows who this is.

No one is going into graphic details, OP was expressing how their kid has a hard time connecting with their own body.

This parent is communicating. Setting boundaries for topics means there’s walls up, i dunno how a child is suppose to know how to navigate that.

It’s my impression you don’t understand and there’s no getting thru.

Way to go OP. EDUCATE EDUCATE EDUCATE. 

I hope you and your family can find their way thru this difficult time.
right yeah periods would just increase all of my other dysphoria in addition to being a whole other source of it. I definitely feel so much more me without it :)
It is absolutely a violation of someone else's privacy to talk about their experience online even if no one know who they are or if you're talking about them.

Not to mention their child is a MINOR. Let's not talk about CHILDREN'S masturbation habits online, yeah? 

Setting boundaries is very important for any healthy relationship. 

""I don't know how a child is supposed to navigate that"", um most kids do not want to talk about how often they masturbate or that they are having problems masturbating or anything in regards to sexual activity with their parents. There is an issue here with the coercive nature of asking a child questions about these things and the child possibly feeling pressured to respond due to the power imbalance/seeing the parent as an authority figure. 

You can educate your child about sex and masturbation without knowing the specific details about how often, where or when they do it.
Yeah, you’ve totally missed the mark. 

OP’s whole point is education and looking for support.

You’re blowing this way out of proportion.
I did provide them support in my other comment I just don't think talking about a 12 year olds masturbation habits online is appropriate and may not be an appropriate conversation to have with them as a parent."	zk92ai	NonBinary	174	0.96	2022-12-12 19:39:30
Gender Expression Vs Gender Identity: my gender expression is fluid and it leans feminine a lot of the time. It's hard to hear things like I look better when I 'make an effort' (present feminine), and I worry people will think I'm just a cis girl wanting to be special when I have genuine dysphoria		"I'd love to have a flat chest and be read as non binary, I feel more like myself when I present less femininely. But I know no one will ever look at me and use they/them pronouns no matter now short my hair is or how masculine I present, so I still like to wear feminine things and do my makeup more femininely because I love fashion. I wish people would take non binary people more seriously no matter how they present.
All of your looks are fantastic, and you are always YOU regardless of what arbitrarily gendered fabric you decide to put on your body. 

In the words of Eddie Izzard (stand up comedian who last I checked uses he/him pronouns and is well known for wearing dresses and makeup and other feminine coded things), ""They're not women's dresses. They're MY dresses. I bought them.""
Your andro looks are dope!! Love the top left one especially.
Im in the same boat. Plus I love makeup and skirts. I am more often than not a man, and I have a male name. People don't care shit for your pronouns or identity though, even when I ""try to pass as male"" I don't and people bend over backwards to use as many girly words to describe me as possible. I hate people.
Hey, you're cute as fuck. Present how you want. You don't owe androgyny to anyone
I feel you on this one!
This can be so frustrating. At the end of the day though we know who we are.
Don't let assholes get you down. You are putting in effort towards your true self. People who mind don't matter, and people who matter don't mind.
I'm in a similar place. By all appearances I'm very masculine and I worry people won't take me seriously when I tell them I don't identify with a binary.
Literally same
[removed]
true words. I also love your looks and wanted to tell you that you're valid, no matter what people tell you otherwise.
Thank you so much :)) that was nice to hear. I've been avoiding looking feminine lately. I think I'd feel a lot better wearing my more feminine clothes if I had a flat chest, it's such a pain when I have nice tops but if I wear them it's like b00bs eW
Tysm! I'm glad you can tell the difference actually. That's me in my 'natural form' as to speak haha
I feel you 😩 'yes GiRL'. Even when you try to explain it's useless a lot of the time. When I told my friends the name I'm going by now one of them asked could they keep my name saved as my old one until they got used to it, she was trying but I hate the thought of people having me in their contacts as my birth name. Eugh.
Aw thank you :') and you're right!
Lol what. If you mean my facial expression I just don't smile in pictures ma dude
Hope you can find people that vibe with your true self. I’m going through an incredibly similar process and if you can find other nb or nb leaning people, you’ll likely find yourself to be much more accepted and appreciated. Cuz authentic you, whatever that is, is WAY more interesting than following whatever template society’s set up.
I was literally referred to as Little Miss Konrad by a well meaning idiot not too long ago.
I'm 30.
Eugh. I feel bad for you. I think some people just need educating about it but it sucks for us. Before I started questioning my gender, in my friendship group we had a trans guy and I regret I wasn't more vocal when it came to my other friends misgendering him, they added him into the 'girls' group chat and stuff. I knew it wasn't the right thing but I was just too shy back then to stand up for him, thankfully I'm not so shy anymore and I will say something now, especially as I know how it feels."	fdxwv1	NonBinary	172	1.0	2020-03-05 16:39:05
Called a Detransitioner	"Time for a long rant!

I started identifying as a nonbinary lesbian when I was 11 years old. I hadn’t ever heard of a nonbinary lesbian before but I figured that nonbinary literally means not-part-of-the-binary so why can’t a nonbinary person be a lesbian? Anyway, went through some shit, decided I was a trans man, only last year at the age of 16 realized I was right the first time, I really am just a nonbinary lesbian. Been a wild fucking ride.

The thing is…everyone says I detransitioned. I had gone full on masc because of how horrible my dysphoria was, binding every day despite my health issues and wearing only masculine clothing and keeping my hair cut super close, and now…now I decided that life is too fucking short to wear itchy fucking cargo pants in 90 degree weather. Now I’ve started wearing what I WANT TO WEAR. Not what I’m “supposed” to wear to be a “real” nonbinary person. Unfortunately what I want to wear is almost exclusively pink dresses. I’ve also decided boobies are hot and I don’t mind having them sometimes. I grew my hair out and dyed it bright pink. Basically I’m all around a lot happier being more feminine. But now everyone is saying I’m detrans. My family got super excited that I’m “going back to being a girl” and my friends completely abandoned any pronouns other than she/her for me. No one ever acknowledges me as anything other than a girl. And if I ever bring it up all I ever get is “come on, are YOU, of all people, REALLY nonbinary?” “You don’t even TRY to be androgynous“ “you’re just a fake nonbinary person” “it’s okay to detransition” even from other trans people. Even from other NONBINARY people.

It‘s like I have to choose between dressing how I like and being…who I am. The worst part is…I prefer he/him pronouns. I use all pronouns but he/him is my favorite. And *no one* calls me those. Not that they called me he/him when I identified as a trans man just…they even more don’t do that now. It feels horrible. My mom has even gotten so used to me being feminine that she’s upset I want to cut my hair. I’M 17 FUCKING YEARS OLD.

My therapist got pissed at me every time I referred to myself with he/him. I didn’t even ask her to, I just referred to myself that way but apparently I’m horrible for that. Perish. Wasn’t why I stopped going to sessions, but it definitely didn’t help.

Leave me alone. Let me be who I am, it’s literally not hurting you. I’m not even asking people to not call me she/her, I’m just asking people to STOP CALLING ME DETRANS. Is that so fucking hard?"	"at least for the trans/nonbinary people in your life it might be good to remind them that presentation does not equal gender
I wouldn't call you a detransitioner at all, and I think it's gross that other people are. You did some ""transition"" type stuff, but none of it was specifically and exclusively tied to transmen. Haircuts aren't genders, binders aren't just for transmen...or oven just for transpeople. Would it suddenly make me a detransitioner if I buzzed my hair and took off the jewelry and makeup. Hell no it wouldn't, because gender isn't just about playing Mr./Ms./Mx. Potato Head and LARPing as a different character than the one you were given at birth. You transitioned, thought you were going to transition further, and then realized you'd gone far enough. There's nothing ""detransition"" about that.
I present extremely feminine, but presentation isn't my whole story either. Thought I was trans for a couple decades, only learned about Nonbinary people last year. And I'm around 40. Sorry you're going through it, man.
“I accept you as a human and respect your right to fully inhabit your body according to the gender you feel and the way you choose to express it.”

I would like to print that out and give it to people and tell them that’s the price of admission to a relationship with me, be it friendship, family, or more.

NessiefromtheLake is perfect as he is!
Keep being you!
You're seventeen. You're still in highschool. You're still discovering yourself. Sounds like you have a picture though. That's great.

When I was in highschool I thought I was just a really fem gay guy. Turns out I'm also an enby lebzo instead. Fuck a guy or two but I mostly just wanna date women. But what do I look like? I got facial hair. I got long hair with a side cut. I wear as much goth/edgy clothes as possible. Pants and long sleeves in 80 degree weather. Would anybody expect me to be enby? Definitely not by looking at me. Theyre gonna see some random mid twenties white dude.

Family is... An issue that will be very difficult, if impossible, to tackle. I gave up, truthfully. I mostly just try to get them to say the right name.
Bruh get a new therapist wtf (if possible, I definitely would !)
The trans community is so toxic sometimes when it comes to sexuality. You can be gay and nonbinary you can be a lesbian and non binary. You can be whatever the fuck you feel you are and non binary.
You need to find a new therapist.
Im so sorry you’re dealing with this.

Transition isn’t a one way binary thing. Especially when you’re… non-binary. It sounds more like you’re continuing in your transition and figuring out what feels good and right for you.

Gender presentation and gender identity are separate things. The same way butch women are still women and femmey men are still men. Non-binary people are non-binary no matter how they choose to dress.

You deserve people in your life who see you for you and listen when you share with them about your own experience of yourself. I hope your friends and family continue to learn and get there soon. And if they don’t, then I hope you find some more respectful and affirming people to connect with 💕
gosh it’s awful people can’t recognize someone being comfortable in both their presentation and their identity. unfortunately i don’t have much advice for you, but you might find some support on r/FTMFemininity (welcome to all trans masc people, including nb people). i’m sorry you’re going through this <3
I’m sorry you’re going through that :/ I hope you don’t let them crush you and continue to be you
Hey, you are valid just as you are! YOU are the only person who has the right to declare your identity. And your identity and presentation are not at all the same. You can be a transmasc or transfem NB, and you can also be a fem presenting FTM. That is up to you and nobody else—not your therapist, or your parents, and not your friends, and of course not strangers. Honestly your therapist should know better. But they sound a bit uneducated in the area of identity. 

Just know you are valid. You are on a journey that may end up being lifelong. Where you are going doesn’t even matter. It may change over time. What matters is that you are at peace with yourself now. So enjoy where you are today. Anyway, you are leaps ahead of most people who never get that far in questioning or exploring who they really are, including those who are invalidating you. Sending good vibes and support.
Jesus, imagine thinking that a 17 year old needs to have everything in order all of the time. 

You're not detrans, you're just figuring shit out. 

I'm 34, I finally starting using the WORD nonbinary a few years ago, but until then, I didn't really know what it meant. But I've always been nonbinary. Even when I put pretty dresses on my AFAB body. Even when I wear make up. Even when people at work call me she/her. Still me, still nonbinary, even if I dont ""even try to be androgynous"" 

God, people need to chill. 

Also, OP is great and people should call him the right pronouns.
I have kinda the same thing, where I thought I was non-binary (at \~14) then came out to a few friends as a (non-binary) trans man and only wearing masculine clothes/haircut (at \~16) and now I'm 20 and much more confortable with the way I dress (I essentially dress androgynous / a little feminine) and I can totally understand your struggles.

Though my friends don't really mind I'm not always masculine (I even sometimes wear dresses and make-up) and I think they respect my name/pronouns  so yeah your friends kinda sucks I think ? I guess it's normal since you're all pretty young but still you can try to send them informative ressources on how gender expression can differ from gender identity ? Also if you move out to go to college or stuff like that you'll be able to meet more open people who'll understand better this kind of stuff :) (my queer uni group is very nice and respect my name/pronouns so there's that)
Even if you were a detransitioner I think its extremely rude for them to call that out when the person in question is not comfortable being called that. There are many people who use transition labels because they don't feel comfortable using the label they identify as or because they still have an internal struggle going on and people trying to call that out is so endlessly rude. Just generally, whether detrans, or not its noone else's business to decide on what you call yourself. If you use a label then people should respect that. People are so entitled and think they know everything better it really pisses me off sometimes. Sorry you have to struggle with that. I hope you get through to them somehow....
So you transitioned ONLY HARDER!!! 

Sorry people are being assholes, clothes don’t have gender wear whatever the heck you want to. The only person you have to live with for the rest of your life is yourself so do what makes you happy the rest of them be damned.
Just wanted to say, thank you to everyone who commented with their support! You’ve all made me feel so happy to call myself nonbinary! I made this post in the middle of the night after realizing that my parents had told my brother I detransitioned while he was at college (incorrect, I just grew my hair out lol). I was really frustrated. But if there’s one thing I realized it’s that the nonbinary community is always here for me! I don’t know that many nonbinary (or LGBTQ at all) people irl so this online community means so much to me. Thank you all!
That sucks so much, I’m so sorry. People can be super intolerant. Being nonbinary is still a type of trans!! And presentation does not equal gender.
Yo ima come over there and fight some of these people fam they are rude as hell, and don't know shit. Of course you can wear girly shit and be non binary you are valid af. You're still Trans just a different flavor of Trans. I'm sorry those people are being shitty.
Those people need to take a step back and chill.  


Who are they to judge you? They have no idea of the countless decisions and experiences that brought you to this point. Nobody's journey is the same.
Oh I'm so sorry that's happening. I'm younger than you, but I also had/have tons of trouble figuring out my gender and how I want to dress and present myself and what not. Nobody has the right to tell you who your are. Only you can really know. And if you change your label 100 times a day, just because it seems to fit better than the one you had before, or if you go back to one you had before, that's fine. It's complicated. 
Your family and the other people you mentioned are assholes. I know it's hard, but don't listen to them, don't make their words the only ones that matter.
I sometimes think of my 20’s & early 30’s as my detrans period. I’d only partly socially transitioned and hadn’t fully understood what I was doing was a social transition, but through mental health issues dove into the closet for a very long time. 

I’ve since spent the last couple of years rediscovering/finally discovering my gender and have gone from nonbinary to binary trans woman to nonbinary trans woman where I now sit. Not at all sure where I’ll end up outside of the confidence that I am medically transitioning to be able to move through the world largely as a woman. That does not and will never erase the nonbinary part of my identity and neither should it for you no matter how masc you present or what steps you take in your transition!

Edit to add: transitioning is not a straight line, though most binary people seem to think it is. I think this is why a lot of folk would think you’re detrans though nonbinary folk should know better than anyone how nonlinear our transitions can be. You are you, and it sounds like you’re evolving greater understanding of your gender and evolving new transition goals which is different than deteansitioning.
I'm in the same boat. When you're older you'll be more able to choose better friends, rather than just people at your school
This brings up an important point about presentation vs gender identity, and if I were you, I'd try to reiterate that. Anyone, regardless of gender identity can present however they want. Transmascs can wear dresses, *cismen* can wear dresses, transfems can wear suits. It all is just how you want to dress, but doesn't invalidate your experience just because of your expression.  


Btw, are you autistic too? I ask because you mention the ""itchiness"", and I know I have a similar problem. In my case, I'm transfem and I find sometimes I get really tired of skinny jeans irritating my shaved legs or even just the ""feeling"" of certain clothes. This is truly valid reason to change your wardrobe.

Also, the thing about being nonbinary is, that you can be anywhere on that spectrum of gender. If 100% fem is a ""1"" and 100% masc is a ""10"", maybe you're just a 4 or something too? I mean, being less male doesn't make you any less transmasc, but it's a journey and you need to find your place on it. Also, sometimes it takes time to find that slot. It may be a slightly different story but I went through something similar. For me I wasn't sure what I was, and ended up transitioning ""full fem"", but that wasn't right. I missed the more gender neutral things I had, and some perceived that as a de-transition too. It wasn't, I was just finding myself. I went ""too far"" and it turned out that's not where I want to be. Maybe you're evolving. But again, that never invalidates your enby gender identity. Every enby is different and has different goals and feelings. You are not ""obligated"" to look agender. In fact that's a stereotype and I'd be sure to point that out, because there's an infinite possibility of gender identities and gender expressions from the enby community.  


I also feel like this is an example of transmascs being treated as ""less than"" too. When a transfem bigender person switches between clothing, people usually question it less - but maybe you're inherently targeted because doing the same for a transmasc is treated differently.  


**You are valid just as you are, whereever your gender journey takes you**. Don't let anyone stop you from living your fullest life, and if the toxic non-accepting people don't smarten up by the time you're an adult, consider cutting them from your life. You have the right to be treated with dignity and respect.
Fuco them all honestly. No matter how many “feminine” things your gender is not determined by that. People love thinking of gender in terms of genitals and presentation because they were traumatized into thinking that that’s all they can be. Honestly, they are bigots for gaslighting you. I say you misgender all of these people and tell them that they are too stupid to really know their gender. I hope soon you can get away from all these horrible experiences.
Don’t let anyone label you shit! Let their labels just fall right off you baby. You’re going such a good job letting yourself explore and not limiting yourself to your own beliefs. If I were you, I’d go to the lgbt center and join a support group online or irl. I have been doing that myself recently and it helps!! Im 28 and im STILL figuring things out and likely will be for a long time. What you wear doesn’t change the journey you’re going on internally. It doesn’t mean anything!!! Men can be fully identified with being masculine and still choose to challenge what is considered masculine by wearing short shorts etc. there’s so many ways to be masc, femme, but it’s really all about having fun, and being open to seeing yourself for who you are with no holds barred.
Y'know I feel like I know the answer they'd give, but do they think genderfluid people are just fully invalid then? Femboys too? How about demiboys? Or hell- cis men who wear dresses. Total hypocracy.

That's what I'd call out the 'allies' on at least.
I would say the fact that all these people hardly used he/him for you even when you identified as a man and presented very masc proves that it isnt you being nonbinary ""wrong"", its that they wouldnt be supportive of you no matter what. Youre not the problem, their bigotry is. I wish i had some advice that would help other than to try and include these people in your life as little as is viable (obviously you cant cut your parents off until your independent if you even want to), but they arent willing to accept what makes you happy, theyd rather keep themselves comfortable. If you cant make them understand, take what happiness you get from being yourself and move on from the people who dont care when you can. There will be people who do and you can hopefully surround yourself with them in the near future. ""Im not detrans because im still not a girl"" should be enough for those who care about you for who you really are, and are willing to learn.
i’m sorry you have to go trough that, it sucks.

The problem here is clearly the other people in your life. It’s very much transphobic to say those kinds of things you mentioned. Bonding with people who understand you online is something i’d recommend if you want to do that. Just overall focus on being yourself and making YOU happy. Not anyone else. I know it’s hard and it sucks but that’s really important. Don’t let them bring you down. You can be proud that you have found out who you are and what makes you feel like yourself! Take care
I’m really sorry that you are going through this.  You might like the subreddit ftmfemininity.  It is enbie inclusive, and it has a lot of transmasculine people who have feminine gender expressions.  I am non-binary transmasculine, and I love purple and pink and some girly things, and I always have to weigh my fear of being misgendered with my desire to express myself.  You have the right to express yourself however you want to.  Your expression is not the same as your gender identity, and these people are straight up misgendering you by saying this.  I’m really sorry.  

Also definitely second people who said you need a new therapist.  Someone with that much power over your mental health who doesn’t support your transition is causing you trauma.  You also don’t need to validate friendships who don’t validate you.

Good luck, beautiful enbie 💛🤍💜🖤.
In a similar boat, non binary and for a while I was thinking about hrt and feminization.  Now I'm a lot more comfy with my masculinity and like to ride the line a lot more or just outright switch aesthetics now and again.  Kind of afraid to say something to my friends because Im afraid I'll get ""oh well how do you know? You said you wanted hrt before, now you don't? are you even sure you're nb?""
I'm so sorry to hear all that. You are who you say you are, and your friends, family, other trans/nonbinary folk and of ALL people your therapist should respect that! 

I'm AFAB nonbinary and present masc quite often but really enjoy wearing dresses and skirts a lot too. It's my first summer being out to people in my life and I'm so scared of being thought of as ""fake nonbinary""...when just as you say, nonbinary means not-part-of-the-binary and doesn't have to bear any relation on your presentation! 

Anyway, it looks like you're getting a lot of good advice from other folk, but I hope you can get more understanding and empathy from those around you.
im an afab lesbian enby and i feel you, im super feminite, im okay with my tiddies, i really wanna wear big frilly dresses and have super cutesy hair, but im just not okay with she/her pronouns, in terms of gender and how i feel its not too feminine but the way i express it says differently. i dont even aim yo be androdgynous or medically transition, i just want people to stop giving a shit about my existance
OP, I suggest following @ glitterandyelling on IG. He helped me a lot in coming to terms with who I am. Hope they do the same for you... & it goes without saying, but **you are nonbinary.** I see you, we see you, and you're not alone.
Honestly what bothers me most about the whole detransition conversation is that I feel like most detransitioners are actually non-binary. Transition doesn't have to correlate to gender reaffirming hormones or surgery, it never has. Of course some trans people are not going to feel comfortable with themselves by being forced to fit into a gender/sex binary. Your identity is valid!
I’m sorry you feel that way. You seem a bit confused since people are trying to force you to “pick” a gender. To me, it seems you’re genderfluid in the non-binary umbrella. But you should just do whatever you feel like. They shouldn’t try to force you something you don’t want
So many people think being nonbinary a fashion statement and it weirds me out.
If you ever make this a shirt on Tee public or something let me know, I will definitely buy one!
Yes. You are SEVENTEEN.  Adolescence is a time of trying things out to see what fits…and it’s going to change and keep changing because it’s supposed to be a delightfully experimental time. Try on different styles, different perceptions of yourself, different ideas…that’s what you’re supposed to be doing!  Folks saying this to you are pretending that who people are at 12, at 15, at 17, hell, at 22, are forever fixed at that spot in their personality…and that’s BS.  Ask some folks in their thirties or forties or sixties if they’re the same person and look at the world the same way as they did at 17 years old.  The answers are probably going to be, No Way! Because that’s such a tumultuous time of change and growth.  Not to mention that we continue to change and grow throughout our lifetimes, if we’re mentally and emotionally healthy.  Some things will sustain when you’re older, but many things about you will grow and change. And that’s wonderful.  I perceive myself and my gender differently than I did 10-20 years ago…at least in part because the ways of viewing gender that are available now didn’t exist in any context I had access to when I was younger.  And cultural conceptualizations about gender are really in flux right now…so the ways of viewing gender are going to continue to grow and change…and people are going to grow and change with that. And that’s lovely and to be celebrated. 

 TLDR: you’re perfect as you are, you’re perfect as you will be, take as much time to explore and grow in your self-perceptions as you need to without shaming yourself due to other’s judgements.
I'm going to elaborate. See, I'm AFAB nonbinary and I go through phases, sometimes a bit lengthy, where I want to express feminine or masculine or androgynous. My therapist, luckily, is also nonbinary. I mean, I own a few dresses and some mens clothes and wear what I want. I can relate. I'm actually going to be legally changing name to something androgynous and am anxious about backlash like this. I've actually avoided coming out so as not have to deal with this from people who don't understand. We don't owe the world androgyny and it sucks your environment seems to think that.
YES to all of this! but especially I want to hype up this bit: **Transition isn't a one-way binary thing.** Transition is not a linear process, especially in many non-binary cases. You were moving forward in your transition when you moved toward a masculine presentation, and you were moving forward in your transition when you moved toward more feminine presentation. Transition is about chasing what feels right; certainly for myself there has never been quite a specific end-goal as much as an absolute certainty that I need to shift in some direction from where I'm at.

Ugh, anyway, I too am so sorry you have to deal with this. I would try, if you have the energy and patience, to explain that concept to your friends/family. Transition is not a direct, linear path to a predetermined destination, and while it is okay to notice and ask about whether you feel like you are returning in any sense to identifying as a gender you did before, it is never okay to assume that shifting back in that direction implies that you are undoing any of your transition. It's all a forward-directional a path that has led you here, not to mention that gender presentation =/= gender. 😒 Basically, I think your humans need to be explicitly told that it is always okay to ask, but really isn't okay to use words for you that you don't use for yourself, and you very strongly do not consider yourself 'detransitioned'.
Yeah-- please know that the environment in uni is so much more supportive. You'll meet people who understand your transition because they've been there, or know someone who has been there. Nonbinary awareness is such a work in progress, but university is the place to be for peak acceptance and community!
Also, as a non binary boy who dresses very feminine at times just because he likes it: if you like it, go for it. It's you who has to run around like that all day, so your comfort should really be above others opinions.
You’re right, I am autistic and I have severe sensory issues with my legs, which is one of the reasons why I gave up pants. Love to see fellow autistics in the wild \^\^
See, totally relatable! So I called it right, lol. I know *exactly* what you are going through with the clothes, and I find the same issues with many kinds of pants/jeans/leggings, but with a dress or skirt, it's just freedom from that awful feeling! I think my sensory issues played a large role in why before transition I always wore severely bagging pants, because I couldn't find anything that felt okay to me, and it was the least itchy and sensory triggering.

As for autistics, you'd be surprised how many of us there are on here. I wouldn't call this ""the wild"" lol, because studies have shown 30% of autistics are trans of some kind, and there's some speculative evidence that autistics also tend to have a larger online presence than NTs.... So it's extremely likely a *huge swath* of this sub is autistic too! We are many here! 😊 ❤️

PS: So ultimately, having sensory issues and preferring dresses, regardless of your gender identity is *entirely* valid. You definitely don't need to ""justify"" your reasons to anyone else, but I do think if they can understand that part, maybe you'll have more luck explaining it to them. There are a lot of parents of cis autistic kids who buy dresses for their cisboys because of sensory issues, so it's more common than you think too."	upbz8f	NonBinary	174	0.99	2022-05-14 07:23:53
Hi! I’m agender, panromantic, demisexual, and use they/them pronouns. I’m trying to discover what confidence looks like for me. I’ve spent so much time overwhelmed with my body dysphoria, and I’m so glad to be doing things that bring me euphoria! Stay safe, folks, and keep being you. 🥰💓		"I’m so glad to have found this community and others on Reddit that allow me to feel comforted in mine and others’ authenticities :)
i’m so very happy for you :) you radiate self-confidence. i’m glad you got through that uncomfy tunnel of dysphoria and are exploring your gender expression! all the best to you sweetie :)
Omg! I'm so excited to find others like me. It's taken me 40 years to break free of the traumas that bound me and am finally getting a chance to be truly me. I am so grateful for the generations after me and your courage... and magnificent beauty. Hoping to learn from you. Hope I'm not too old. I don't know what I'm doing. 😳💖
Aww thank you so much, your kind words mean so much to me 🥰 I’m very thankful to be at a point of expression now rather than suppression 😅"	ocmw2n	NonBinary	160	0.98	2021-07-03 00:05:59
I got a $15 dysphoria begone the other day. Loving my haircut and am a very happy enby. Though my moms reaction was less than perfect. 🤷‍♂️		"To give some more information, my mother cried for sometime after she saw my hair, and mentioned starting therapy the next day.🙄
For what it's worth, I think the haircut totally suits you. Also, rad earring. I'm imagining it as a tiny, glowing portal to another dimension. Sorry your mom was less than awesome in her reaction. I hope she comes around.
Your hair looks awesome! Also is that a zelda shirt??
My mom sobbed like a baby when I cut my hair. Thought that I ""wouldn't be safe,"" bought me numerous dresses and skirts (even though I NEVER wore them, even before presenting as more masc) and made me promise that I'd regrow it and wear makeup every time i went out. 

Fuck it. Do you. Be happy with you. I'm proud of you. You look great. 
Regardless, looks amazing!!
You're so cute tho omfg I love it and your face is hella gorgeous 
Holy cow, people! Your comments really made my night ten times better. Thanks so much! 😁
Wow, that haircut looks so awesome on you!
It looks awesome! I think it really suits you!

Also A+ Avocado earrings! :D 
Perfect! I've been longing for an undercut and I hope I have as much success as you!
Therapy for your mom seems like a good idea :\)
Omg I was imagining them as some cute cross between an avocado and a penguin! Which makes no sense 😂
Yes, it is!
Yeah! I ended up coming out later that night, and both her and my stepdad were convinced I was going to commit suicide because I’m trans. Ugh! Luckily there’s only a few mor months of this, then I’m going to a different college. Woot woot! Also keep it up yourself pal! Let’s do this!
Thanks 
Thanks! I’m sure you will!
They are actually avocados with little googly eyes, but I would definitely wear avocado penguin earrings 
Rad! Love it! "	8adfcz	NonBinary	165	0.96	2018-04-06 21:51:13
Elijah (he/him) - feeling myself again after a dysphoria rabbit hole that lasted ~2 months. I was down BAD but I pulled myself and finally feel good again ! I took pics to celebrate :)		"You're killing it bro
Two months falling down that hole sounds like a rough ride, but I’m happy we get to welcome you back topside!! Good on you! 🎉👏
omg one of my favoirite people is also called elijah!! (or just el for short)
looking good <3
You have a very masc face !!! I understand the dysphoria, but remember that you are how you project. Tap into your divine masculine, comfort your divine feminine, and you’ll thrive. 💕
You are so hot
You're fucking handsome
this warmed my heart thank you!
thank you !
thank you !!

Having a lot of dysphoria today! I want to be femme but I love being masc? AHHHHHHHHH. Like sometimes I just want to be a girl but I want my body? Quarantine is a good time for a gender crisis. Any way take a selfie		"Goodness, you are gorgeous. And HOLY SHIT SAME ON THOSE VIBES! I continually feel femme/masc like I'm on some fucked up metronome.
Quarantine gender crisis twins !! I feel a similar kind of dysphoria where I don’t necessarily mind being femme (afab), but first I want to be seen as masc. Like if I‘m ever wearing a dress I’d want to be seen as a more masculine person wearing a dress. Gehh

Also your smile radiates warmth and that’s a beautiful necklace!
Omg thanks (but when u see me?) I get SO much imposter syndrome when i do damn near anything these days. I want so bad to always wear skirts and make up but like i am comfy with my masc voice??? Like what is liffeeee??? Lol
I like your little tag thing, very cool. Keep smiling :)
Where'd you get the pronoun chain? It's awesome!!!
Awh owo. Luv uu!! Make up feels fantastic. Thanks for the snoop. <3 you look fantastic regardless tho.💟
Ok, so what I do is half and half. It really helps with dysphoria, and it looks super good. Like, I’ll do a silk black button up, and a black blazer on top, and then like pink athleta leggings on the bottom. Either that or some women’s jeans that are super hip-hugging, with the rinestone fern-ish swirls on the sides and back pockets. Or I’ll do a long-sleeved baby blue crop top, and some fancy knock-off men’s sneakers, and some cargo pants. Occasionally I’ll put in one golden hoop earring in one ear, and a golden stud in the other. Helps a ton for me, and hope it helps you out too! Sending love and validation your way. 🏳️‍🌈😘
Ok, you could get a really androgynous looking feel going and then get some butch fashion and then get some femme energy and be ever so nb. Like what if you were a sorta feminine butch woman or a sorta masculine femboy man? That second one is what I am. Also afab.
Oh thanks!!!! Last few days have been femme days and ive been like “do I want to transition???” Then other days I want to just wear endless amounts of tweed and look like a psychedelic English English professor. AHHHHH
(You look gorgeous too!!!!!)

Feeling extra good with my beanie!"	"Ahhhh you’re on a ship!! That’s so awesome, I want to work on the ocean. Got my first taste of it this summer and I’m hooked. So glad you’re loving it

Looking pretty awesome. I would ship you \*rimshot\*

Another pic from my pink t-shirt photo shoot. I've been feeling a lot of dysphoria the past couple of days. Hoping that I get over it today.		"It’s a lovely shade of pink on you! 💅💖 I hope your dysphoria abates today too.
Ahhh you look great!!
Glad to see you again friend!!! You're still lookin' cute!!
Thanks. I love this t-shirt, one of my favourites.
Thank you and feeling a bit better just now. Hopefully that continues.
Thanks. I woke up to a miserable drab day this morning but I'm thinking of putting on some makeup and doing some photo's this afternoon. I've got some new clothes to try."	l5g15t	NonBinary	155	1.0	2021-01-26 15:17:58

i know i pass but i can only see myself as still having feminine features :( how do i combat dysphoria? transmasc		"i genuinely see no feminine features. ya look handsome as ever!
Dysphoria can be such a personalized experience that I don't have a one-size-fits-all answer.  HRT made an enormous difference to me, but not everyone has such a strong response to it.  I suspect dysphoria has more than one potential cause.

I think you cut a strikingly handsome figure, for what it's worth.  Wishing you happy results on your own journey.
I genuinely took you for amab at first and started thinking of ways to look more feminine to tell you!

To look more masculine, I've found makeup helps a lot. Certain methods of using bronzer to make cheekbones stand out, or temporarily staining peach fuzz to look more like a beard. Haircuts can also make or break a face!
I don’t really see the feminine features.  Are you sure you aren’t remembering features you once had?
Maybe try drawing a portrait of yourself if you're into that sort of thing? I have found that it helps me to see what I actually look like and realize that I'm actually pretty nice looking, to study myself in a mirror and spend a while perfecting an eyelid and be like ""wow, that's a fantastic eyelid."" Good luck friend, you were blessed with thick eyebrows, a nice jawline, and eyes that are medium sized (idk how else to put it but i promise its a compliment, I think large eyes can feminize a face but some men have these teeny tiny beady eyes. Yours are small enough to read masculine but big enough to be expressive and nicely fit the rest of your face)
I don’t have any advice for your dysphoria, but I almost thought you were a cis male troll but then I decided I knew better than to say anything lol. But if you’re fr, then- honestly, dysphoria got all of us delusional af, no offense.

Like, when I’m feeling masc, I look in the mirror and see the curviest woman in existence, but then when I’m feeling fem, my hips just cease to exist. Shit drives me insane.

But nah, you look completely, masc to me, and I’m the bitch that answers “guess my agab” posts honestly, so you know I’m not lying.
Have you tried words of affirmation?  I look myself in the eye in the mirror (or work up to that if mirrors are tough) and tell myself the thing I want to believe.  For example you could say ""I am a man, this is what men look like, I don't need to change how I look to be a man."" Or something that connects with you. It sounds so simple but can really help.  You can't control your thoughts, your brain will always sneak negative thoughts in, but you can counteract them with intentional thinking.  I tell myself ""big bodies are good bodies, my body doesn't need to be smaller to be good, my body's appearance doesn't determine its worth"" etc.
the only thing i could think of would be to fill in your eyebrows a bit. this can help with looking more masculine. but agreed with other commenters that you already look masculine! :)
you literally look so masculine bro. 
are u pre t? if that's so then wow, you're super lucky!! dysphoria sometimes fools you and makes you worry about things that aren't even there. if I saw u irl I'd assume ure a dude. a thing that could help masculinize you just a little more is filling in your eyebrows. otherwise, you're super handsome
You look very masculine to me.
If its your thing, shoulder pads/higher shoulders pose? Saw some cis man who used shoulder pads, looked extra blocky.
You already look very masc, so take this with a grain of salt, but personally i found stretching my septum a few gauges made it feel a bit more masculine. But you really have nothing to worry about, you look great!
Do you have any old photos of you pre transition? Try looking at those and then look at you now. That helps me sometimes. I notice I’m happier and seem to be myself more. It’s hard to notice progress when it’s gradual. But it’s super obvious when you look back where you started.
Not sure how to help since you do look pretty masculine to me. What about your appearance bothers you?
I'm sorry I don't have any advice and having dysphoria must suck, but I do think you look very handsome and masculine :).
sometimes it helps me if I imagine how I look in someone else's eyes - like I'll take a selfie then pretend I saw that person on a train. I realize I look really masculine.

I don't know if that will do anything for you, but if I saw you on a train, I'd see a masculine person
thank you 🥺😊
thank you. i hope to start t soon because i will feel better mentally, physically, emotionally, spiritually. i’ll feel myself
i think i am :(
how do i fix it?
i love this, thank you!
bruhh okay that makes me feel so much better. i know  that im not crazy for feeling this way. and im a femboy so i get that asffff😭
thank you very much :)
thank you :)
yes im pre t :) thank you sm
thank you :)
thank you!
yooo i’ve been thinking about stretching my septum— does it hurt?? 😭
i will :}
my jaw and face shape :( but only t can change that
thank you :)
Wait you look that masc and *haven't* started t?
Just believe people when they tell you that your looks are not feminine at all.  Some people are just being kind.  I tell people what they don’t want to hear all the time.  So that I am telling you not to worry, that should be enough.
It probably depends on your anatomy a bit but for me the stretching process itself wasnt horrible, but it stung for a little afterwards. The bigger the gauge the longer it hurt, the first was a day or so and the last time hurt for a few days, I think because it was starting to press against the cartilage. But not so bad i wouldn't do it again!
I can understand your insecurity, but you look masculine in these photos imo. I did hear some makeup and hairstyles could help with these features, but idk how these work myself.
nope i’m pre t :}
thank you :)
okay!! im at a 16g, wby?
thank you :)
Right now I'm at 12g but I'm getting tempted to go up another one xD, I pierced it at 16g if i remember correctly
awesomeee thank you <3
No worries, good luck!"	rpf5i7	NonBinary	154	0.99	2021-12-27 04:54:27
Feeling good for the first time in years. I feel like ME. I am older than a lot of people on here (44) but I never felt like a girl and the dysphoria has been building the last few years. I got this shirt the other day and I had a chance to wear it out today 😊. I feel GOOD.		"Congrats!
I am glad you are opening up to yourself. :) Welcome!
Congrats! And I'm 49, so don't feel bad about that. :)

Your happiness is SHINING! You look great!!
Looking dapper!
Hey there! I'm 35 myself. Like you know that feeling when you've been uncomfortable all your life and you finally come upon the gender-term that describes who you are at long last? It's like having a huge weight taken off!
You look so good I'm happy for you
It's nice knowing there are other people in my age group that have found who they are, and are happy
YES! I'm 33 and totally confirm!
Thank you 😊
Why thank you. Next time I'll get someone to take a better picture of me. Mirror selfies aren't always easy
Exactly! My family tried to get me to wear dresses all the time when I was little and I was always uncomfortable, mostly because I wouldn't ""sit like a lady"", so people saw my underwear a lot, lol. I hated the ruffles, the patent leather shoes, and the sheer amount of pink was nauseating. I wanted to wear pants and play sports, but I still tried to fit in with friends. It was confusing and aggravating. 

After high school and after my kids' father left, I slowly started to come into myself. I learned how to be comfortable in my own skin. I learned that just because I had boobs and a vagina didn't mean I absolutely had to know how to do makeup, or how to style my hair, and I did NOT have to wear heels. Good lord, I hate heels. It didn't mean I had to wear my hair long, or wear traditionally feminine colors (I wear a seriously huge amount of gray and black. Mostly gray though). A lot of people think I'm a lesbian and I've learned not to care what other people think. I've figured out (FINALLY) who I am, and what I am is happy, content, and not questioning myself anymore. I wish that kind of contentment for everyone.
I've been on here a couple of months, and while there aren't a ton of us in our 40s, hell, we're GenXers and are pretty much used to that 😁
You're welcome! :)"	erj9vv	NonBinary	151	1.0	2020-01-20 20:39:32
Got my hair cut short today and I feel like a lil boi and I love that. My brother also told me I looked like “one of those guys in that kpop-band” 🥺 My dysphoria is so low rn.		"Wow that haircut looks super cool!!

Been struggling with image and dysphoria recently. I’m not sure who I am. Here’s an attempt at some self-validation.		"You look awesome!
You look amazing 
You have a nicely shaped face; quite androgynous
I'm in the same boat. Almost want to go back to looking/dressing all girl since it's familiar, even though invalidating. I don't know. I keep waiting for the hormones to help but I haven't seen changes in months and I still look very feminine. Hope we can both figure things out ❤️
Your personality/character really shines through in this pic! Looking great!!!
I think yr fuckin b e a u t i f u l and that you’ll keep 
f e e l i n g beautiful if you keep doing beautiful things from your center of being (the only way, that every time I do try it, it works to alleviate enby/transmasc image dysphoria that I have)
Also you look great!!!!!
Thank you! 
Thank you! 
Oh my gosh this comment made my day, thank you!
OOF. SAME. Like I feel sometimes I should just dress all girl too, even though it’s been making me more and more uncomfortable of late. I’ve been thinking about hormones too- solidarity my friend, we’re gunna be ok xxx
Ahhh this is so nice of you! Thank you xx
Ahhhh oh my gosh thank you xxx I’ll keep that mantra in mind

I wish I wasn’t non-binary	"Honestly, I wish so much I could “just” be a trans man

I know it wouldn’t be easier, but holy shit I feel like it would be so much SIMPLER to be a trans man. I’m so sick of feeling way too trans to be cis and simultaneous not trans enough to have confidence in myself and just come out already. I’m so sick of feeling dysphoria every single day and knowing that even if I receive every medical intervention I want and get perfect results that solve all of my physical dysphoria, people are *never* just going to assume I’m non-binary, people are *never* going to gender me correctly, there is no option to “pass” for me. 

I want so badly to just squeeze my eyes shut and force my stupid brain to just go “all the way” to male. Why did it have to get stuck halfway there? After transition I’ll probably be seen as male for the majority of my life anyway, it’d be SO much simpler if I could just embrace that and let that be who I am. But it’s not who I am, because I’m not a man. And I’m not a woman either, clearly, because this whole being in a woman’s body thing is NOT fucking working out. 

I don’t want to come out to my workplace and have to explain to these mildly homophobic people that not only am I trans, I’m *different* trans, *special* trans (🤢), and you need to make even *more* effort to accommodate me. My boss is 73 years old, does he even know what being non-binary is? He’s a good man and I’m sure he’s down with trans rights, but non-binary people?? 

I don’t want to come out to my extended family and face not only their religious views but also their terf views with yet *another* complication. I don’t want to live the rest of my life picking between two bathrooms, two ID boxes, two standard pronouns, two sets of social norms and two sets of expectations, NEITHER of which feel right to me. 

I’m so sick of being deeply injured by transphobia, turning to trans spaces for comfort and seeing the new UltraWokeNess^TM “being trans is a choice!1! Gender doesn’t even really exist!!” like I would *ever* choose this, and bitch if my gender didn’t exist, why does it cause me so much pain then??? Or telling me I just want to feel special, I’m just appropriating intersex issues, I’m just confused, I’m just making things up, they’re just “not sure” if non-binary people are real, they’re just “not sure” if non-binary people can be dysphoric, they’re just “not sure” if I deserve a single *crumb* of human dignity. 

I’m so fucking sick of this life and being in this body, I’m SO sick of being afraid and uncertain all the time, I’m so goddamn tired of having to defend myself and my existence and my experiences over and over and *over* and knowing the attacks will never stop, I’m so fucking *done* with hearing she and her every single day like a slap to the face and knowing it’ll  be *ages* before I can correct them, *ages* before my body starts to feel like mine, *ages* before things will start being the normal I’ve never had. 

I just wish so much I could “just” be a trans man."	"[deleted]
I relate a lot to this. I'm a demiguy (at least I've taken on the label for convenience, because I'm trans masc and usually a guy to some extent), so I'm in this weird place where I'm not man enough to be a trans man and not nonbinary enough to ""really"" be nonbinary. I feel like I need to choose a side all the time, like I can't just be me. I've tried leaning into just being nonbinary and it's gone okay, but I just found out a big step in my transition is coming and that veered me right back to demiboy territory. I think I'm some vague kind of genderfluid, I don't even know. My gender is just plain fucked up and it makes no sense, changing all the freaking time but always being nonbinary. I just want different anatomy and I want to not be gendered by people. But I can't have that. In order to get the medical transition I want I need to totally be a man. In order to be seen the way I want to, I need to be totally nonbinary (and even then it's unlikely people will ever gender me correctly). I'm just... so tired of this.
It's rough always having to explain yourself, especially when it's well-meaning people with the exact same questions over and over. But, somebody's got to be the one to slowly educate the population on these topics so that future enbies don't have to deal with this struggle. At least we live in a time where after an explanation, most people will go ""okay, sounds reasonable""
I know how you feel, I identify as gender fluid for convince but I never feel like a man, it's only ever nonbinary or transfemme it's weird, and confusing and I hate my own gender, I want to look in the mirror most of the time and just have boobs, I hate my awkward skinny male body, but at the same time I'm not fully female either and I just want to scream.
I’m sobbing
I hate to say it but I honestly wish I wasn't nonbinary, or LGBTQ sometimes. I wish I could just fit into the mold that was prescribed to me since birth and just be the person my parents wanted me to be: Cis straight feminine girl that loves dancing is super responsible and has the same interests as my mom. But I just ended up the complete opposite. I have tried and I sometimes consider trying just pretending that I am that person they want me to be but it just feels so wrong and it hurts so much. I'm tired of being a constant disappointment to my family, but at the same time, I'm tired of living someone else's life. I have no experiences that are my own, and when I do it's riddled with so much shame, fear, and self-hatred, that I can't even enjoy them. I wish I could just do whatever I wanted without the constant shame and internalized transphobia/homophobia associated with it. 

TLDR: I relate lol.
I have had the struggle finding others that can relate to me.  I am notmsure of my labels.  I have thought I was demigirl, at first and then nonbinary, but honestly I am not sure. For years,  years! I felt that, that something was missing from me.  Recently, I had gotten up the nerve to wear a packer (socks) and see if it would help.  It did. I saw myself in the mirror, body hair, bulge, full beat of makeup, and I felt A LOT better.  I started crying! It hit me like a wave. Just looking at myself, it felt like a relief. I too don't feel specifically like a man, or like woman. I'm just me, it's all I know how to be.  I am still trying to figure myself out as well. Its a start.
Just want to say I relate and it's hard but also I think you're awesome and it's cool that there's other non-binary people like me out there
Tbh same :"")
This. So much of this. I'm fuxking tired, i don't even explain anything now, I just say I'm fucking queer.(both context😭)
i feel this. i feel like we’re at a point now where there is more binary trans visibility and understanding (including enormous pushback and violence), but that at least people generally get that there are trans men and women and that binary is more accepted. trying to explain being enby to my parents, who want to support and understand me, but clearly do not understand, is so hard! and i know it’s going to be hard forever, and i will have to either CONSTANTLY come out, or accept being misgendered all the time, which makes me want to crawl out of my skin. the world is so damn binary and it sucks. but i agree, i also don’t think it would actually be easier to be a trans man, i think no matter what being trans is not easy. sometimes i am so filled with self-doubt and loneliness i think about just being closeted and pretending i’m a cis woman so i don’t have to deal with the world. but i’ve done that my whole life and it made me miserable, and i know i can’t anymore. i can’t un-know my gender now. and i don’t even know what it is, i just know what it’s not. but i also think that we are showing the world that we exist and we’re valid and unless we do it no one else will. and it’s good to know i’m not alone in this struggle. ❤️
I feel those feels bro
Idk what I am
It's like you reached into my brain and pulled out exactly the thoughts I've been trying to put into words. It would be so much easier to just be able to pass as either male or female. It sucks that we not only get shit on by the transphobes, but also by the *""rEaL tRaNsGeNdErEd PeOpLe""* who still think gender is a binary system. I wish I could offer a solution or some advice but I can't. People are starting to become more accepting but it's still a dangerous world out there for us. Hopefully someday we'll be accepted into what's considered *""normal""* in our society, but until then we just have to keep doing what we can, being out to who we can, and coping as best we can. I can't offer a solution, but I can offer solidarity. You're not alone in feeling this way. I hope you're doing alright 💕
I'm struggling with something similar too  
Sometimes I wish I could just convince myself I'm cis so I don't have to worry and stress over all the obstacles that come with being nonbinary
I googled “I wish I wasn’t non-binary” and found your post. At the very least, thanks for making me feel less alone <3

Do. It. *Please*.
Add me to your mailing list please!
>I can’t un-know my gender now 

This, right here. In the past couple months I’ve been making an effort to “put being trans back in the bottle” so to speak, because I’m not ready to come out but not having a transition on the horizon is starting to seriously eat away at me. 

It was so easy not to realize I was trans for 23 years, but now that I *have* realized there’s no going back, as much as I might want to.

Anyone else deal with their dysphoria by dyeing their hair? Gone grey this time 🧓		"All the time! I've been blue and blond before over the past few years, I'm red right now, gonna go silver/grey later this year :). It's such a small thing, but it does really help.
Me constantly🙋🏻‍♀️

Your hair looks really good!!
You look a bit like Jack Frost :D

I think it looks great
my hair went grey and now i dye it
same i just went pink again after a year with ""natural"" hair
love the colour \^\^

I've been wanting to dye my hair but unfortunately I'll have to wait until my internship is done haha.
awesome color for an awesome person 
Not yet, but I'm planning on dying it lavender.
yeeeep, didn't even realize that's what I was doing at the time, but it sure helped!
Yep! Sort of a slate grey-blue right now, moving back to an ashy pastel purple. Think that’s the best color I’ve had so far, but hard to keep the same color for more than a few months. Things get bad and the dye comes out lmao. (I could deal with my problems or buy hair dye???) Hmmm...)
I do indeed! 
I really want to dye my hair again, but I can't because my current job doesn't allow any hair colors that aren't ""natural"" and my hair is very dark so bleaching it light enough to try gray or lavender would take ages.
It took me a while to realize that was what I was doing, but totally. Been dying my hair for at least 15 years at this point.
Yep! One of the first things I did after coming out was cut my hair super short and dye it red lol. I've dyed it before (usually red or purple-y), and I've had it pretty short before, but this time I got a more masc cut on purpose. My plan originally was to just dye the top red and have it a bit longer, but I decided to dye all of it now (easier anyway), then shave the sides short again in a few weeks once the top grows out more. I'm looking forward to the new 'do!

And I love the grey! Looks good on you :-)
Yep me... aside from probably unconsciously doing it for years I now am aware of the fact that having darker hair makesme look more masculine which is great!
Dyeing and shaving my hair are classic signs of me trying to regain control of my body/life haha. Did you do this yourself? It looks amazing!
I've wondered about dying my hair, although I dont know anything about it and I wouldnt want it to be to permanent in case I didnt like it.

Is there any knowledgable NBs you can enlighten me?
Yeah! Took about three separate bleach sessions within a fortnight but uhhh guess that's self care 💁 sorry hair
If you wanted a vibrant colour, but didn't want to commit too hard, you could always bleach and dye just the tips of your hair? That way if you don't like it, after a couple of weeks you can just cut it off with no damage done to your roots
You could also experiment with spray-on colours, or get some hair chalk. These are one-day options that would give you a chance to see what you like without committing for as long.
There are different types of dye that vary in the permanence. I'd suggest going to a beauty supply store and asking some questions about products or even youtubing temporary dyes for reviews. I use Adore mixed with my conditioner to ""refresh"" color and it washes out pretty quickly if I don't do so. It's cheap and easy on my hair and I can change colors more often that way. That being said, certain colors wash out more easily than others so you might want to research colors a bit too if you're undecided.
Thanks for the advice!

No gonna lie though that still scares the absolute shit out of me potentially having it there for a couple weeks!

Might just have to take the plunge some day though. Have to wait and see. 
There are some temporary hair dyes that more just coat the hair and can be washed out. Look at costuming/Halloween shops (I know, wrong season) for stuff like that, or at some cosmetics shops. Online stores should have a lot of options too. Search for ""temporary hair color"" and check how long it lasts. You can definitely find some that will wash out the next time you take a shower. Good luck, and have fun with it!"	apwg0r	NonBinary	145	1.0	2019-02-12 18:25:41
Yesterday I felt nice in my cute denim dress, today I'm denied, dead named and depressed. I wish I was somebody new... got them old time dysphoria blues 😕		"Denied what? Dead named by friends/family?

Sorry that happened to you though.
i wish i felt euphoria or happiness but im hapoy you did and hope you have more like you deserve
Are you MtF Non-Binary? That's what I consider myself as of now, but I'm only 4.5 months on mono E. It might change as I get further into my transition. As of now my job knows nothing about my transition. Although my mom knows and pretty much has denied my feelings also, as I'm not really out to anyone else though besides my LGBTQ+ friends or online friends, I don't expect anyone IRL to use my new name yet. Won't expect that until I come out at work, which at this point I'm totally lost as to when or how I'll do it. Should be interesting as I work for an IT MSP and we have a couple hundred clients I work with both in person and remotely. So when I do I won't just have to do it one or twice, but come out to each business we work with for IT.

Sorry your co-workers are not accepting. I don't know what kind of work you do, but can you bring it to HR that people are not using your proper name? I guess that's even if you have HR? I work in a small MSP, so we don't.
you are wonderful and gorgeous and deserve to be treated with respect and your true identity acknowledged and accepted. i see you and i love you.
I understand fam. That’s why I stay closeted and wear baggie hoodies to hide my shape. Still get called a Lady most the time tho :/
Hey, I appreciate your concern. Denied existence and dead named by co workers. They aren't malicious but they're old fashioned, and as much as I explain myself I'm referred to as everything from a drag queen to a transvestite. It gets really draining and there are only so many times i can roll my eyes and not let it get to me. I'm done questioning myself but I forget that even though I understand who I am the rest of the world doesn't. Being in lockdown is limiting my access to people that validate me and my self esteem is taking a beating. That's kind of why I posted here, to connect with people who understand. Thanks for commenting, I feel slightly less shit 🙂
Good luck with coming fully out. I was made redundant last year from my office job but introduced my new name as a nickname whilst I worked there. I live in a very old fashioned part of the UK and that job was rife with homophobia and racism so I'm glad they got rid of me (this was due to covid not because they're bigots). I currently work self employed and have been setting up my shop during lockdown, I'm based in an arcade so there are several other shops, mostly vintage. Anyway to cut it short, the other shop owners are very tolerant and my own shop is LGBTQIA+ focused. One of the guys I help out knows that I'm NB but when I explained that I was getting married he told me that I'd be taken a lot more seriously as a husband rather than a significant other which caused a bit of an argument and pretty much showed what he really thinks. Another example that gets to me is if I'm not presenting as fem then all of a sudden everyone reverts to my dead name and forgets my pronouns, there's even one lady who consistently comes up to me and says ""Oooh, you're mister dead name today"". I know I'll have to get used to it running a shop but it would be nice if gender wasn't seen as superficial. Urgh, rant over 🙄 thanks for your support and I really wish you the best! 😊
Thank you so much! It sucks not being seen as i see myself. The media's unattainable beauty standards have got into my brain and caused a lot of self hatred. I'm not the most superficial person but it's nice to be complimented. I posted a picture because I want to feel pretty but it doesn't take long for the self hatred to creep back in. Society should be more like this sub 💛
Hi there. I'm a female and have been ""lurking"" I guess, because I want to learn about and be supportive of people who aren't just straight male/female. You are beautiful. I can't begin to imagine your daily struggle but you have my condolences. Society needs to do better.
I live in smaller town just an hour away from Silicon Valley that is pretty LGBTQ+ friendly, so I expect it won't be a huge deal. I expect some of the women at our business clients to not be all that surprised as they seem more ""clued"" in by small remarks/jokes that have been made. I take it in good fun as little do they know what they have said is true, I do consider myself a ""woman"", just a non-binary woman.
Thanks! It really made my day that you said i was beautiful. I have an irrational hatred of the way i look which causes most of my dysphoria, it's such a boost that a stranger can be so kind. I don't usually look for validation from other people but I've spiralled throughout lockdown. The support in this sub is incredible. If the world were as open minded as you society wouldn't need to change 💜"	lrb6w6	NonBinary	146	1.0	2021-02-24 12:01:18

“Would you still be nonbinary if…”	"I always think it’s odd when I talk about how I experience my gender and how I’m transitioning in a way that people would stereotypically expect a binary trans man to transition (I’m on hormones, want top surgery, and semi-related hysto— of course many trans men transition differently, I’m just talking about stereotype).

Like I talk about how I want to transition to a point where I will always be read as male in non-safe public/social settings, but how I’m still nonbinary/genderfluid (and how I like to be read as queer in queer spaces) and I usually get this response;

”*Would you still be nonbinary if you were amab ?*”

And it usually feels like they’re using it as a “gotcha” as if they’re about to catch me up or something. I know this style of question has helped a lot of people, but the people who ask me usually say it in a way as if they’re trying to get me to admit to not being nonbinary or something.

Of course, my answer always frustrates them. When I answer back “Yes, I would still be nonbinary, and I would still have dysphoria, it would just be a little different.” The shock and awe they have learning that I would still be nonbinary/trans and would still have dysphoria if I were amab.

It’s like the people asking me cannot comprehend the fact that there are people who are actually nonbinary and not just “trans men in denial” or “trans women in denial.”

Like recently, a trans guy I am friends with asked something along the lines of “why transition to male if being amab would also make you dysphoric ?” I just think it’s so interesting, because I’m not “transitioning to male,” I’m transitioning to a body I’m comfortable with. That just so happens to be a body with a flat chest and more testosterone, but I’m still not a man. I feel like I often get looked over, because of that, though. Like people see me and are like “yeah well you’re basically a trans man” as if I’m not allowed to want to present in a masculine way and still be nonbinary."	"I've thought about the inverse scenario quite a bit as a trans-femme non-binary person, and I'm quite sure I'd still have been non-binary if I was AFAB. I might not have realized it as quickly if I was allowed to just be a GNC woman without being pressured into binary roles much, but on the other hand it might have been more comfortable for me too. 

The body I prefer is definitely more in line with AFAB although I don't mind not having the ability to carry children, that would destroy me. Running on estrogen CLEARLY works better for my brain, I'm not constantly depressed. And I don't think I would mind the small boobs I've grown even if they were a bit larger and I was AFAB, it's still unlikely I'd have ended up with massive ones due to genetics. I'd like to have been a little shorter but I don't think I would have liked being as short as my mom. 

In the vast majority of ways I feel very much like I would have ended up still as a femme-to-androgynous presenting non-binary person, and I identify really hard with a lot of the AFAB enbies I know who aren't likely to change much about their bodies aside from preventing their ability to have kids, but who still don't like being read as women constantly.
It’s a question I’ve asked myself. I think I’d still be nonbinary if I was AFAB. I know a few family members, and friends of my wife see me as a trans woman. Like I think I’d have less physical dysphoria but the social dysphoria might be worse.
I'm on feminization hormones to get my body to align with my mental image, which is probably skewed by the fact I spent a large portion of my life with mostly male characteristics. I feel like my transition goals are somewhat driven by accumulated dissatisfaction, and if I was born a woman, I'd likely go for masculinization hormones, and would again probably be driven by accumulated dissatisfaction from the other side.

So yeah, that'd make me both trans and nonbinary regardless of the gender I was born as. I get the frustration about the ""in denial"", it's an impression I get a lot from people when I tell them what my goals are. It's annoying that they try to put me in a box that makes sense for their heads, but doesn't fit me at all.
This. This is SUPER RELATABLE for me. 
I'm on T (though won't be for life, most likely), want top surgery and hysto while keeping the ovaries, I'm even contemplating getting some form of bottom surgery (not phallo, if then meta w/o balls) and I'm still not a man. I'm just masc. I also want all the T changes, but I wouldn't mind some reverting in the end. But a beard would be neat, I want to try different styles once I actually grow one (if ever)

Edit: big typo (hysto=history lol)
I don't have all the details, but I'm pretty sure I'd still be nonbinary if I were the opposite sex. I'd probably be more comfortable wearing femme things, but I'd probably want less body hair, and genitalia would be trickier. Not sure if I'd want E. Maybe microdose? Then again, that's how I feel about T at the moment too. Definetly see where you're coming from here. It is a question that appears to have helped several ftm people though

Edit: typos because I was barely awake when commenting
Well you are valid no matter whatever gender you were born as and aspire to be! :D
More than ten years ago, a couple of my friends (one of whom is trans) asked me if I wanted to transition, and I answered that I would just end up on the other side of the same problem. (My understanding of transitioning was at that time quite limited to the binary, and though I knew I was neither male nor female, I had no idea I might be trans.)

But I still like that answer. Transitioning for me would not at all be about me wanting to be, or even pass for, ”the other gender”. It would be about trying to reach a position where I’m finally free and comfortable, and recognise myself in photos and mirrors. And if I had been born ”the other gender” I would have had to shift to find that position as well. Just in another direction.
I'm afab and lean femme, while I still dress pretty femme and wear makeup that doesn't make me a woman. It makes me a nonbinary person who likes those things. Expression is not the only facet of gender identity but cis people sure like to treat it as such.
Interesting how I end with a lopsided 38c because my body through medicine side effects or just otherwise whack hormones during puberty, anyway I ended up feeling like my body fit better than my gender roles. It pointed out how hard I was forcing myself to pretend I was a man, it's nice to finally feel free of that. Ohh what's a GNC women anyway? I'm still new to this stuff.
I'm honestly not sure I'd identify as non-binary if I was AFAB. I might be, but I think there is a chance I'd have stuck with it. I would probably be genderqueer at minimum, but might mostly use she/her and femme expression.

Thing is, I'm not a transwoman in denial. I'm not denying that if I was younger and transitioning was possible, I'd almost guaranteed have transitioned. But living over 30 years identifying as a man, or trying to, and finding out how to be masc, even forcing it on myself, it changed me. It didn't make me a man, it just made me associate MUCH less with femininity and wanting to be a woman. I remember crying into my pillow as a kid wondering why I had the shit luck of being born a man. But I learned masculinity, became comfortable with my body, and finally kind of found a comfort zone like ""I guess I can live as a man, I know how to be one"".

But then I learned about non-binary people and realized it fit so much better and this is absolutely my comfort zone. I'm more comfortable with masculinity, but I'm not a man. I'm comfortable with my body. Socially I love not being gendered as a man anymore. I hate being gendered as a man, and would feel terribly uncomfortable being gendered as a woman. This is me, and I love it now.

So, does it matter if I was AFAB and wouldn't have been non-binary? Not in the least. That's not how it went, that's not my life experience, and today I'm non-binary and in no way in denial of being a transwoman. I'm just trans, enby, and happy.
I relate a lot— It’s a really confusing thing to some people when I explain that I’m transmasc because I’m afab, but that I would very likely be transfemme if I were amab— I feel like I short circuit their brain when I try to explain it to them. /srs

I just want to be a pretty boy and a handsome girl, is that too much to ask ? /lh
Ninbinary. Micopdose.
Mood, literally the other way around. I kept thinking what was the point of being nonbinary if I was still going to mostly be masc and then it just kinda clicked that I was, that would be like a week ago tomorrow so still haven't come out to anyone I know irl but feels good.
GNC means gender non-conforming, no biggie to be new.
lol yeah the ""point"" is being self-aware and knowing who you are. clothes and bits are not defining, just a means of self-expression!

Could use a little validation. My boyfriend's cis and I'm nonbinary, it's been difficult without any community and my dysphoria keeps getting worse. Any positivity definitely welcome.		"I'm AFAB nonbinary and my boyfriend is a cis straight guy (mostly straight at least. I tease him that he's little gay and he takes it well ;) ). I'm lucky because he is so supportive of me and fully believes in my identity. One time I even said that it would be easier to just be a girl and he said ""no it wouldn't because that's not who you are"" he went on to say he's glad that I'm nonbinary and wouldn't want me any other way. I share this because it can be hard being in a relationship that looks cis and straight from the outside when that's not who you are and I want you to know you're not alone. You didn't specify if your boyfriend is supportive or not but I want you to know that if he isn't there will always be someone out there that will love you for you and they can only do that by loving all of you including your enbyness. Community is hard to find and right now I have no one I interact with in person who is Queer. It's tough but online communities help and always remembering YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Also new haircuts or styles and new clothes sometimes help me with my Dysphoria so try that if it's an option for you. Know you can look enby any way you want to. Wear what feels good to you and fuck what everyone else says. Good luck friend, know we have your back here. <3
Lots of hugs to you.
You are so valid, and I like your hair :)
You. Are. Fucking. Cute. And. 100%. Valid. 

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
You look great and are super valid! *hugs*
You're always part of the nb community! You look like such a great and nice person!
You're a good, valid human. I hope you get better soon, friend!
i love your hair so much :) and don't be afraid to talk to your boyfriend about it! it might help
You have nice eyebrows! Hugs if you want them.
I know it’s hard sometimes, but you look great! I love your hair and your glasses!
God I relate. My bf is cis and he doesn’t understand how much dysphoria hurts. I know how it feels to have someone who otherwise cares about set you back on self-validation and my PMs are always open if you want someone to vent to. It’ll get better and just remember that he still cares about you, even when dysphoria is like “nah b”. Because dysphoria is a bitch.
Hang in there. Sometimes you find community in the most unexpected places. I haven't tried the Transcord Voice/Text chat linked in the sidebar but I've found Discord groups in general to be a great antidote for feeling isolated.
You are adorable and amazing! 🖤💚
Hugs, you are valid.
Ur a vaild badass and u will conquer all the assholes.
My boyfriend is cishet as well. He knew I was nonbinary (AFAB) before we started dating. He is supportive of my identity . It's a little strange since I'm not out to my or his family. He has to use ""she/her"" when talking about me to his family since he knows they won't understand. The only difficult thing is that while he's supportive of me potentially getting top surgery, he's not sure if we would still be in a romantic relationship. He also doesn't want to go with me to gender therapy because he wants it to be my own decision. I've told him that it's hurtful but we're sort of at an impasse. 

You aren't alone! You have an army of nonbinaries on your side!
You're passing well! I know it's hard with dysphoria, but you can pull through it!
Also your hair color and style is lovely and idk if this is a weird thing to say but.. you have really nice shaped lips. 😁😁
Wow, this really helped.. 

I'm in a similar situation and I k ow he tries but he's new to this whole situation and sometimes gets it wrong
Thank you!
I appreciate the validation! Also, this is the longest my hair has been in nearly ten years, thank you :]
Thank youuuu
As long as he believes you and wants to try and understand and you are able to be patient then you got this. But if he can't understand and doesn't improve.. honestly that would be a dealbreaker for me. One of the things on my list of ""Standards"" for a partner is they need to respect and support me in my identity whether that's my sexual orientation, gender, interests, dreams, background, or whatever else. I can't compromise with someone who doesn't meet that standard, but that's just me. If he's really trying and really cares though he'll get it eventually. Just never feel like a burden for being who you are and you are always justified to expect a certain level of respect from someone.
That's really awesome. I'm actually growing my hair out too :)
This would be a total dealbreaker for me too, but he really is trying and he is respecting me. 

My biggest issue is, that there are no gender neutral pronouns in my language which makes it really hard for me to see myself as enby sometimes
Ugh that is really hard. I'm so sorry you have to deal with that. Would using the opposite pronouns from your GAAB help you feel less dysphoric? It's not ideal but I think that helps some people. You could even just try them out for a little while and see how it feels.
Nope.. I'm closer to my agab than to the opposite, I already thought about that

I also thought about neo pronouns but hardly anyone knows how to use them (myself included)
Yeah it's a tough situation... I hope you find a solution or can at least find other things that make you feel enby enough to compensate."	d3fawm	NonBinary	140	1.0	2019-09-12 22:07:09

I honestly don't know what I'd do without my amazing husband, he's so supportive and accepting even though he doesn't completely understand my dysphoria, and I love him so much 🖤💜💛 April 21st is our six-year anniversary of being together!		"Ahhhhhh I love your style!!!!  

So happy for you, it helps so much having someone who supports you

I've been married almost 7 years but with my husband for 15

He's been so wonderful, and loving. But yeah he doesn't quite understand dysphoria and how unsexy and untouchable I feel when it gets bad. He doesn't understand why I needed to come out to be happy.  But he still loves and accepts and supports me through it all so I feel like we can get through anything
That's awesome! Congratulations! :D
I love this! You don't have to ""get it"" to be supportive!!
Damn, you rocking that. And he sounds like a sweetheart!

Newly out as Non-binary (they/them). Tattoos, piercings and bandanas are helpful for the dysphoria. People keep telling me I look fem and it breaks my heart		"I don't know why people think you look fem, you look androgynous!
I dunno what people are on about, I strive for a similar aesthetic!
I will gladly relieve you of the fem-ness thats allegedly there. I dont see it either, but if you do find it, I will gladly take it off your hands XD
I strive for a similar aesthetic and definitely get called femme. It definitely makes me feel dysphoric, so I get your feels. You look phenomenal, and androgynous and lovely.
I don't know if you look fem, but you look awesome 👍
Everything is well put together, I wish I had style like you do
You have no idea how much it means to me to hear that. I’ve been struggling to find my personal aesthetic and it’s even harder since I came out to my parents
My aesthetic is legit “no longer a teenager but still in my alt stage” and I love it. I’m so happy you enjoy my style!!! 😊
You’re welcome to any fem-ness I come across!
Thank you so much! Apparently my hair doesn’t help with the femme look. I just like it on the longer side
Thank you! I’m quite fond of my personal style :)

Is it normal to cry over dysphoria?	"Basically what the title says: is it normal to cry over dysphoria? My mom says she can’t deal with the crying everyday anymore, and I feel bad. 
I (they/them) am a non-binary person who often gets dysphoria, mostly top dysphoria. I know I probably can’t get top surgery when I’m older as it’s becoming more restricted in America, and I don’t want to break my ribs so I don’t wear my binder everyday. I have no “dysphoria outfits” either because currently we cannot spend that money. And since I don’t know what to do, I cry. Backstory: I cry frequently. Depression, anxiety, sewerslide, etc. When I am mad. I don’t know what to do, so I cry. And I cry from dysphoria and not being able to have a flat chest, anti-trans laws, and the prospect of probably never having top surgery. 
So, is it normal to cry over dysphoria? How do I handle it?"	"It is 100% normal. It sounds like you are overwhelmed with negitivity, your body, politics, and now your mom. You NEED to cry. Don't hold it in. Just because she can't handle your emotions doesn't mean you shouldn't have them. She needs to do her best to comfort you, not try to get you to bottle it up.
Alternstive title: Is it normal to cry when passing through a negative and emotional sensation?

Short answer: Yes.

Long answer: Also yes, but now I'll explain it. 

Here the problem is not just you are passing through dysphoria, nor that you had depression, anxiety, nor other negative emotional problem. The problem here is that your mother is already frustrated over it.

Yes it's normal to display your emotions, and even more, to let it flow if you can, as bottling yo everything sometimes can be more troublesome for the person, and that is even without having another mental/emotional problem.

Now if we add the other problems you have, is an even less reason to not display your emotions. 

As I mentioned above, here the problem resides on your mother. Now before commenting it over I don't know much about your mother nor how she treats you except for what you put in here, so this may cause confusion or problems when approaching, so I'll give the benefit of the doubt and have the most broad actions attached to her.

For what I can read, your mother doesn't have the problem specifically with your dysphoria, nor with your crying. The problem I can see is that she has the problem of not knowing what to do, not how to act when you are passing through a negative/difficult time, which you can often manifest as a cry. Maybe she already did what she could before reaching a point where her own problems made it in to a bad point, as you mentioned before, you don't have spare money to use, so meds or things that could help both your mother's an your mental health may be out of the reach.

Yes, maybe she is over with trying to endure it, maybe she tries to but don't know what to do, and in the end displays this action because she doesn't know how to act... As you try to let go of negative emotions she stresses because doesn't know how to help and tries to stop what she thinks is the source, in this case you. So no stressing over it for her...

This is not healthy for any of the people involved, and should try to reach a better point of understanding between the involved people...



Now that is assuming that your mother is just over or having trouble with the panic of what to do.. I don't know how is your mother outside of it, or what is on her mind. In any case my recommendation would be to go to a person with the right credentials to help you get better, but without a hate towards your existence. This may help you and your mother both in the short and long run, but will cost you money.

I really hope this gets better soon, and that with just a close talk between both of you improves, but if not, I hope you can endure until the opportunity of an improvement comes.
it is 100% normal. Crying lets all the negative things leave your body for a short while. Being sensitive to your own body and the world isn't a bad thing, trying to hold it in is. If you want to find different ways to regulate those feelings, go for it but not because someone can't ""handle"" you crying. Crying is a natural response to any and all things that make us feel terrible, cry all you want sweetheart
Absolutely— trans guy here. I would cry almost every day some weeks before top surgery and T. (And I figured myself out right after Dump got into office.) Even before I figured myself out I would cry for apparently no reason I could tell, which was in hindsight dysphoria related. 
Also, if top surgery is what you want I know you will find a way. There are states with actual Medicaid that pays for affirmation surgery. Just got my meta in NY. Be strong, take courage from the community. Things absolutely can get better. You will find a way to make it happen. Hang in there!
It's not only normal it's very beneficial you gotta let it out. This world is crazy and keeping that all inside just makes it harder
Okay, hear out the whole story, the world is a sad and fucked up place in some ways, most of which you already touched on, and yeah, life is hard.

However, you can usually find sollice in friends and within yourself. Learning to love and accept yourself is hard, but learning to reach out is even harder. For the long term you can indeed get top surgery and that will help. But for the short term a good solution might be reaching out to friends. Being vulnerable with them. This is hard, super hard, it will be something that you might not want to do, but once you reach out and they offer a comforting crying shoulder that helps so so SOOOO much. 

I know life seems difficult, and stuff is hard, and you're fully in the right to want to cry all that away, it's only natural. Friends can help do much in alleviating the stress, pain and anxiety of life.

Best of luck to you ❤️💜
It’s completely normal. Crying is perfectly natural way of expressing yourself and your emotions. It is so important that you feel and process your feelings and let them out. Do not repress them.
>So, is it normal to cry over dysphoria? 

Yes. Sounds to me like an absolutely reasonable emotional reaction to your circumstances.

>How do I handle it?

I don't know. \*Hugs\* The US isn't the only country in the world, though. And people flee persecution with the literal shirt on their backs. Not saying that you should, but just to point out that, even if it may seem impossible to you where you are right now, it might be a goal worth fighting for. If this political situation spirals further out of control, you might have a serious case to make for asking for asylum outside of the States.

That's long term. In the here and now: are there things that give you comfort other than physical stuff?
Yes, it is. Let yourself cry. It's okay to cry. Lots of people have cried those tears. You aren't alone in this pain.
It's good to cry, you need to feel those emotions and cycle them out. Next you should find a way to get a therapist or counselor. It's not easy and you may even have to shop around for a while but it's something that can absolutely save your life.

Gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia are frequently entangled and are very confusing and difficult burdens to work through on your own. Especially if you're still in your teens and your body is going nuts with all kinds of hormonal fluctuations.

Things can get better, they probably will, really. We just have to try hard and refuse to quit on ourselves.
It can be normal. Your feelings are valid. Feelings aren’t facts (for example I sometimes feel dumb) but they are real. It sounds like you deserve support to process your feelings.
People end their lives over disphoria…

Yes, people cry over dysphoria, I’ve been transitioning and I still cry over dysphoria, just today I cried about bottom dysphoria. It’s a lot better now, I used to stay in bed all day, now I can at least go out and dysphoria comes in “bursts” instead of being ever-present.
Yeah it's normal. I have cried over it a few times myself so I get it. Dysphoria sucks, so it's understandable to be stressed about it. Crying is a normal and good way to release the stress, it's not good to keep your negative emotions bottled up.

 As for how to handle it...maybe you can try journaling. Just write out all your sadness and anger. It helps a lot since it's a nice and healthy way to let out intense feelings
It's totally normal to cry, over any emotional pain.  Also - when you get older, there will be a place to get top surgery.  Somewhere in the US, or at least somewhere else in the world.  You will get top surgery.  There's something to be said for realism, but when you really want something, you can always get it.  That's been my experience, at least.
It’s totally okay to be struggling with those feelings. In terms of feeling better about your chest I have personally found tape binding to be what’s best for me. My skin can handle it and I don’t have to worry about the effects to my ribs and can wear it for a couple days at a time. If you can, maybe research it a bit and see if it could be an option for you. Admittedly, I don’t live in America so I can’t comment on the anti trans laws you guys are dealing with, I just know it’s fucking horrible, I hope you guys come through it okay ❤️
I'm Gonna Say Definitely Yes, It's Normal. Believe You Me If I Could (And I Knew It Was Safe) I'd Be Crying Over My Dysphoria Most Every Night, Unfortunately Try As Hard As I Might I Can't Cry More Than Just Like Getting My Eyes A Tad Bit Wetter Than Normal...

Y'all ever want modular body parts like Mr. Potato Head?	"I want top surgery cause of my chest dysphoria, but occasionally I like having boobs. But in the fashion accessory sort of way, not in the gender euphoria way. I wish I could get magnetic ones or something I can just pop on when I feel more fem and want to present that way.

Am I the only one that feels like this?"	"Dude, this is *exactly* how I feel. I like dressing up occasionally for going out and I love doing cosplay but I wish I didn't have such a female presenting body for my normal life. It's a pain in the ass tbh
God if I could unscrew my boobs I would keep them off 99% of the time (which is why I want to get top surgery or at least a reduction) but that 1% where I’m like damn my books look great today
I was JUST thinking how top surgery + silicon boobs would be fantastic. I’m used to having boobs, but I’m not at all used to my binder.  Plus it would be fun to get a reduction, wear fake boobs normally, and then go to the beach and BAM!! Shirtless.  I 100% would love modular body parts, but also I have ADHD and am easily distracted, so I know I would frequently leave the house with only one tit on.
Yes yes yes all the time! I wish I could just take them off and put them back on whenever I’d like.
I ended up getting a breast reduction instead of top surgery so it’s easier for me to bind when I want to and I can put a push up bra on if I’m feeling more fem. It’s made me so euphoric and I have so much less chest dysphoria now! I know this isn’t the fix for everyone but it’s for sure something to look into if you want.


Edit) for reference if anyone is curious is started out as a 34 G so binding was very difficult for me and now I’m about a 34 B (that was as small as they could go while keeping the nerves connected) and now I’m flat when I bind!
I want this but with a dick.

Now I hear you say 'Packers/dildos are a thing""

No. I want a fully functional, fully feeling, real dick I can wake up and plug on. No surgery, no nothing. Just dick.
Have you ever heard of the tragedy of r/transtrans?
Yes, I really want this for my bottom bits.
I was just thinking about this!
I could do with an extra pair of shoes and my angry eyes just in case.
Sometimes, yes.
Yes! I understand this and agree!
Yup sounds good to me.
I am a cis man, and yes, yes I do want detachable boobs, please. If I could just have detachable boobs and penis to mess with when I'm bored, I would not only be less bored... But also more like a stone golem, which is, after all, probably my final form.
I would like an attachable penis… I mean I guess that’s kinda what packers are but not exactly
As someone who wants s a flat chest so desperately, I genuinely like the idea of wearing fakes boobs if I ever felt like it, rather than having real boobs, which get sweaty and need support.

That being said, u would love to be a soft robot that could detach and attach body parts at will. Being a shapeshifter might give me indecision, but it sure would be cool too.
Omg yes, if theres ever a trial for that id voulenteer 😂
I have no interest in keeping my breasts but I feel this way about a peen/vag.
Yep
O no, I'm the same, tho I haven't any boobs at all and would like to have some that I could just pop on and off.   


There's always top surgery for you, and silicone chest molds for both of us...
Yes, yes, and yes. Also facial hair as an accessory, please
If you end up getting top surgery, you could always get prosthetics or forms! They can actually be pretty cheap if you look in the right places!
I’d definitely forget where I put mine. There are a lot of things I need to store in plain sight so I don’t forget it exists but I feel like modular boobs wouldn’t be something I could store in the open… 🤔
Sorry the 1 tit sounds fun tho, just to confuse people
Thanks for the laugh this morning I needed it:)"	sxa8m4	NonBinary	127	0.99	2022-02-20 20:14:49
hi folx, been feeling kinda down lately abt myself physically n dealing with a lot of dysphoria. being effeminate and enjoying makeup brings up a lot of odd and inconsistent dysphoria for me. anyone else struggle with similar types of dysphoria?		"Not so much dysphoria, but I did have a lot of struggle with feminine-assigned clothing, among other things, being AFAB. I never really figured my gender out until recently, so growing up I always had a dislike for things like skirts, dresses, make-up, etc. I even hated the colour pink for a really long time because it had such strong connotations. Honestly, I’m surprised I didn’t realize I was Enby sooner, it was kinda obvious looking back on it.
I’m talking with a few folks on Reddit right now - just came out fluid Monday; and I am one unfortunatly masculine body (even bald...thanks nature! Lol ) but have always felt like i am 98% fem at least 75%+ of the time. I have no concept of where to begin and not look ready for the stage somewhere. I need to work in an office when I go back and simply can’t be in this “designation” any more. Totally in a dysphoric (but excited and albeit much happier overall) place here. Power, you are stunning and...help?!? Lol
Yesss i completely understand, not too long ago a came to the conclusion that I'm non-binary, and also started noticing my disphoria, i use to think those were just random depressed thoughts but now i know that this uncomfortable feeling with my body is something that will not just dissapear with time, it's a pain in the ass lol
I do! I'm afab but certainly enjoy lipstick, especially dark ones and I think they suit me well. But on the other hand, it causes me dysphoria, as it is associated with women and it makes me scream inside skdajfskd make-up isn't only for women/feminine people!!
I suggest embracing things that intrest you that may help you with dysphoria that you can change up for work! things like taking time to play around with a little makeup on your time off, or finding a pair of heels that fit you so you can just longue in them alone and feel sexy or even try to learn to walk in them. Lingerie has been a big tool for me in my dysphoria because it holds different connotations in our minds too. If you're feeling like maybe boxers arent your forte sometimes, I encourage buying yourself some panties or maybe trying out fishnets. theres also a lot of really amazing wigs out there for cheap if that's somthing you really want to look into also! the possibilities are endless and even though sometimes it's hard to not feel damned about our bodies sometimes, just remember that your body is just the meat suit that your energy inhabits. I always highly encourage tailoring that meat suit to fit what feels genuine to you
ive always struggled with body dysmorphia so I just thought my gender dysphoria was some weird extension of that. knowing your feelings feels so good
Amazing response! Thank you so much!!"	goghnj	NonBinary	131	0.99	2020-05-22 09:58:00

I have returned in true Ryu fashion. With facial hair. I tried something new and realised that trying to ignore my dysphoria for the sake of aesthetics may not have been worth it.		"Welcome back! I think 'tis an important lesson here: no matter how good it looks, your well-being matters more than your art, your purpose or aesthetic. It was reasonable to try, though!

I was always scared to cut my hair bc of dysphoria but I did it tonight and surprisingly I feel 100x more fem :) My goal was to look like Nancy downs which was a fail but I still like it		"Really cool look!!
I find that I always look super fem when my hair is cut short and more masc when my hair is longer!!! I think the more femme longer hair brings out my masc features and the masc shorter hair contrasts my femme features (petite face). Crazy how that works. You look so good!!!
GIVE ME YOUR HAIR, AND YOUR SEPTUM!!! please<3 im to scared to cut my hair and im not aloud to get a septum
You 100% nailed the Nancy Downs look wow!
I love your look! Your septum piercing is awesome. I just got mine done 3 weeks ago.
Joan Jet - oldschool cool 🙂
you look really cool
You’re pulling off the look I’ve low key been chasing beautifully!! Congrats!
Very nice,well done!
Thankyou :))
Yeah I get that!! I had a overgrown mullet and I absolutely loved it because of how androgynous I looked, but I think the shorter hair makes me feel more myself and euphoric. Thankyou!!!
I would if I could!! I’d say cut your hair honestly, it’ll grow back eventually and I’m pretty sure you can get fake stretched septum jewelry!! I’m not 100% sure but Amazon probably has some if they exist lol
This is the biggest compliment wow
Thankyou so much! My septum will forever be my favourite piercing after all the time and pain it took to stretch
OMG! Thankyou so much!!
Thankyou sm!!
Yea no problem! I totally feel you just the other way around :} I feel myself when my hair is longer <3 totally dysphoric when it’s short. GL with your hair journey!!
I bet! I’m looking forward to being able to change mine. I want a little black ring with a bat.
Omg that’s so cute!! I wanna get a silicon tunnel so I can wear a ring with a spider!!

Nonbinary alternatives to mom or dad?	"I just became a parent last week and it's freaking wild and crazy and awesome, but I absolutely cannot figure out what feels good as an alternative to mom/dad/mommy/daddy. My partner and I thought we could just feel it out with time and see what happens, but I'm getting called mommy by nurses/doctors constantly and it's causing a lot of dysphoria. I need to make a decision I can live with on a more immediate basis even if we end up using something else later on. Any suggestions? I had originally thought I was going to use nom, but it just feels too...cute? clever? not sure, just not resonating. Another alternative I liked for a while was da, but that's essentially just dad which I'm also not really comfortable with. Appreciate any help!  


Edit: Wow, what an absolutely incredible response. There are so many wonderful suggestions and messages here, I am so happy reading through all of these and getting great ideas. After going through this post with my partner, I think we're going to go with 'zuzu' for now and see how that works! Unfortunately I am not able to respond to everyone here but thank you thank you thank you all! "	"I know a kid with a nonbinary parent, they call them nonny
I get dysphoria when strangers call me “mommy” or “mama” but not my child. Weird.
My children call me ""parental unit"" - not sure where it came from, but it works lol
I use the term “ren” short for parent when referring to my non-binary self or partner to my fur kids
I know some folks who are Zaza and Zizi, and that works great. Now that their kid is in preschool, they sometimes talk about their parents as ""mom"" and ""dad"" but as in, ""Zizi is my dad.""

I also know people who've looked to their cultures of origin/ancestry for different parenting words.

also can I just say...I didn't know I was nonbinary when I had my kid, but medical professionals calling me ""Mom"" and ""mommy"" made me murderous.  I think they do it so they don't have to know your name, but it's also like ""Hello!  You are no longer a person, you are now a ROLE.'  ugh.

also: congratulations on parenthood!  it is fuckin' amazing!  and don't worry when it's unbearable, because for at least the next 5 years or so, change will be constant.  Stay hydrated!!!!
I've been using ""pama"" (papa/mama) for my friend n they got really attached to that
i frequently use Perry (short for parent) or wall/mod.
I like nom. It's super easy for developing babies to say (just like mama or Dada). I honestly might start using it for myself. (Ps I always hate when the nurses call me mommy, hang in there)
I agree with others but just want to add something else that _probably_ won't apply to you but could be really nice if it does; Do you have any siblings who gave you a nickname that your kid could use for you? Or names only family members use for you that you'd love?

My siblings couldn't say my name when they just began talking so they came up with a baby-fied version (Tita). For a while even my parents called me that because of how cute it was to see my siblings do it. Recently I started wondering about what I want to be called if I ever get kids and remembered this nickname from decades ago. My kids'll know me as their Tita!
What about moddy?
I spent a lot of time thinking about this before deciding I was okay being a non-binary dad. It’s really nbd (the dad jokes are coming in great!). Love to see the other suggestions though!

Side question, anyone know a good queer/trans/nb parenting community? As a new parent and a recently out NB I could use some specific community!
I'm just thinking of lame synonyms of ""parent"" and taking the first letter/syllable to baby it. ""birth parent"" = BP or bebe. Progenator: Gigi. Begetter: bebe or gigi. Nurturer: Nunu. All a bit juvenile but something might stick. Congrats on becoming a parent!
Genderly-ambiguous parental figure.
Probably ‘parent’ or ‘ren’ as the official term, but I’m sure you could come up with something that you’re the most happy with
Once again, I’m advocating for „Pear“, a cute shortage of parent \^\^
If you are comfy, maybe some play on your name? Like the first letter? My same starts with S for example, and little one often struggled with my old name. I don’t as called “Sia” or “Sisi”. A lot of letters can be used to creat unique titles, if that is something that feels right.
I recall a podcast I was listening to and someone asked a similar question. Among a few things, they brought up the term ""Nibby/Nibi"" and it just made me smile. It just sounds funny in an endearing/cute kind of way, but also used the NB letters.
I know a couple with two kids, one of them is a woman and the other is nonbinary, and their kids call them mama and momo.  I think that's really cute.
OB-GYN nurses, lactation consultants and all level of maternity staff gotta stop casually using “mama” it’s so lazy and annoying. Hoping one day those big white boards for patients have an area for pronouns.
Congrats on the kiddo! My friend’s name starts with a B, and their kids call them B or BB
one tiktok person i watch uses donkey kong as their gender neutral parent name lmao
My brain is cracking up over the idea of Dom and Mad but I don't think they fit.
Ren/renny is one ive heard a lot
From pa""ren""t
I see a lot of people suggesting ""ren"" as a short form for parent, but i believe it might be hard for a small child to learn, so maybe ""nen"" or ""nenny"" since they are kind of an easier substitute for the r. The thing is, Im pretty sure someone on here did a full on analysis of what words would be easier for babies to learn.
Baba is a word used by Central-Eastern Europeans for both parents and grandparents. Making a gender neutral term for parents. It is also easy for babies learning to speak to pronounce.
my friend uses baba! 

eta: am also nb and my niblings call me titi!
I believe someone did the science on it and the easiest noise a child can make is WaWa i think
I like the idea of something simple that a baby can figure out how to say quickly, like boma (the one I'll probably use)
I have a friend that wants to go by Ren, short for Parent. Mom and Ren, Dad and Ren, Mom and Dad and Ren... You get it ☺️
Have you considered **parental unit** instead?  


Beep. Boop. I'm a bot.
i go by ren/renny, short for parent!
For my pets I use Nada instead of mama/daddy and Neither instead of mother/father.

Nada came first from looking for a combination of sounds that didn't just sound like a mom and dad name mushed together, and when that pun was discovered, Neither followed pretty quick!
Maddy, Moppa (mama + papa), Zaddy…
I'm not a parent but hope to be one day. I've been trying things out to myself and ""Appy"" is the one I hate the least so far
I've heard of Baba (instead of Mama or Papa I guess)
I've heard Baba, Adi, Maddy..... there's a lot of options! You can probably create one that sounds nice to you, as long as a tiny kid is able to say it
My brother's son just calls him by his nickname, simply because he picked it up from everyone else calling his dad that. You don't need a title if you can't find something that feels right!
I ended up picking poppy! But I’d also be fine with just my name too.
Congrats! I'm a cat parent and go by ""nary"" (like the end of non-binary) when referring to myself as their parent.
Nana, nonny/nany (no•ny/nah•ny).
https://www.same-sexparents.com/post/gender-neutral-non-binary-parent-titles

Here’s a link with a list. I hope it helps being a spring board to give you ideas!
I’m in the exact same boat. It’s fine my husband calling me “mom” but when other people call me mom or mother it feels gross. Especially when people start talking about /motherhood/. I actually had “don’t call me mom etc” on my birth plan and people basically started calling me “sweetie, darling, honey” and that was just as bad. (Why can’t you call your patient their name!?) I’ve heard of Renny but I personally can’t really get the hang of using it? I liked something like zaza (like zayde which is grandpa in Yiddish, my partner is Jewish and I am lazy but might convert lol) but it just doesn’t really end up easy to use conversationally? I’m hoping my kid might come up with something silly or funny when they start talking
The young ones at work dubbed me Mad as a cross between Mum and Dad, but also how they all view me. I love it
Honestly, I can’t wait to be a parent so my baby can call me bubby!
I am Bubby in our house! Bub for short. She still says dad every now and then, but quickly corrects herself!
Someone else said NuNu which I like. I watched a lot of kdramas and Japanese shows in middle school and called my mom Omma (idk if I’m spelling right) cuz I liked how funny it sounds when you whine “oh-maaaaah” or oka or oppah. Eventually my sister did it too for laughs. Then my mom just learned to be called by that. Idk I know it’s technically still mom in another language but maybe it’s vague enough in English to be less dysphoric?
MODDY
if i decide to have a child, they will call me nonny, nommy, non or nom
I'm a parent, I go by Babi - used as dad in some countries and grandma in others
I just refer to my folks as the rents
The first syllable of my name is ""Ni"", so I always picture myself going as ""Nini"" when I become a parent. Could you do something like that, with your name?
I mean I haven’t figured out a parental name yet but I’m gonna have my brothers kids call me Mimi instead of uncle or aunt so maybe that could work as a parent to
My ex referred to themselves as “ma-pa” with our furbabies. We also have a mutual friend that chose “da-ma”… hyphenations excluded, just did that for pronunciation sake 😅

Edit: soft a’s on them all
My partner calls me Little Bear, so when my niblings came around, we decided I would be Bear or Bear-Bear. Easy to say and gender affirming.
Once upon a time I read a fanfic that used “Baffa” as a parent name (this was a two dads situation, and the kid in question came up with the name for his second dad), and I’ve always liked that one
Nona (pronounced No-Nuh). my gf suggested it to me once and its stuck ever since. most gender affirming word ive found so far
I know someone who refers to themself as the Jewish Other which is just a play on Jewish Mother (they naturally take care of people around them and just happen to be Jewish). Good luck on your search to finding a parent name that fits you!
I guess this is what you are leading the kid to say when they can talk. I can't say what would be easy for that time. As when I grew up I would call my parents their names (got smacked a few times for that), parental units, idiot 1 and idiot 2, eggbearer and sperm donor, overlord of smacks, the ruler of my home, the head of house, and mother/father unit. They hated all of them and kept telling me to call them mom and dad. 

Nana or nommy or something might be a good start, but pay attention to the names your kid gives you on their own. It could tell you how distant they feel from you.
Not a parent yet but when I am I'm planning to go for Mapa :)
my partner is zizi! and i prefer pops/dad
Ren/Renny, which are short for parents 😋
I’ve always liked the idea of “Mada” as a name for an enby parent. Just a mix of mom and dad, or mama and dada.
To be honest it’s the name I go by now, I liked it so much, but I still plan on using it with my kids.
I’d love to hear my kid say “my madas here” 
It sounds similar to mama a little but I think mod could sound good too
Y'all like ATLA? If / when me + my partner end up having kids, I'm going for Appa / Uppa :)
NANI?!?!
The structure of the word definitely makes sense; the first letter has that same letter repeat in the middle of the word, and it ends with y- just like “mommy” or “daddy.” My overanalyzing autistic brain approves ✅
My partner told me it's slang for slime fruit and vagina but I'm still using it ahaha, that's the cherry on top XDDD
Non
I think it makes sense, for strangers it's kind of like a nickname that is also a gendered category(like how ""shortstuff"" is a nickname but also a description), but to your kid it's literally just your name. And even when they learn your real name, they won't think of you with that name unless they make a conscious effort to
Y'know what's funny? My brother and I used to sometimes refer to our (cis) parents as our ""parental units"", and I also don't know where it came from!
I still call my parent that sometimes but I think I originally saw it in the coneheads movie.
hehehe, i called my parents that in middle school. they hated it. they asked if I was a robot. I said ""yes!""
When you outside and you smell that zaza


(I really hope you get this joke)
What you’ve just said about no longer being a person but a role, and losing a bit of your identity in the eyes of others as the role of ‘mother’hood comes first reminds me a bit of an article published this morning, you might find it interesting! 
https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jul/17/why-must-mothers-be-expected-to-suffer-in-silence-emma-beddington-marianne-levy
friends of mine have been using this for me and i love it so much
A non-binary parent? \*puts on hat\* PERRY the non-binary parent?!?! I love that though, might use that if I decide to have kids in the future!
aw I like this.  My younger sibs had a sweet nickname for me too, it would work as a parent name.
I love this too but my kid nickname was “Menina girl” which Menina means girl in Portuguese 😭
I don't know of a community (yet) but I am like you. Happy to talk about it. I am not a new parent but relatively new to accepting my non-binaryness. One of my kids is NB as well, and the other is lesbian.
I love nunu and gigi
A bit ambitious for a future first word of the kid
It's actually pretty common to say in Swedish as slang for parents, ive heard so many people go (translated) ""my pears are away for the weekend lets do ____"". Never even thought about using it in singular though!
Same! Also can you imagine how easy it is to mix up all the “mamas” like… how about our names or even just bed 42 feels better than a generalized name
There are actually linguistic studies about babies and the sounds they first start making in different languages! I don’t know any off the top of my head, though; it was mentioned when I was in college.
Oooo this is clever! I'll have to keep this in mind should I ever become a parent.
I'm an Enby parent and we use Baba. I'm AMAB so the slightly more masc leaning meaning isnt too big an issue for me :)  


  
Plus I'm a massive horror buff so Baba like the Babadook is a big win for me hahaha
Or even swapping them around, Dama, could work too! I love this
What?
Its what my older sister had my parents in her phone as for a long time
Yes, it's originally from the Coneheads skits on Saturday Night Live. Long time ago now.
I’m not the person you responded to but I found this funny af
Yes, I’ve heard of MaPa.
Ah yeah that sucks ): Better to find something less dysphoria inducing! I mostly just got lucky with my nickname but I can imagine it doesn't work for everyone. Like when nicknames assume gender or are based on your deadname or something like that
Sooo true!!! That’s like just as good omg

I haven't been shopping in a long time because of some bad dysphoria, but one of my best friends (also an enby) convinced me out of the house this weekend and I found a couple things that actually made me feel really good. Cropped polos are my new favorite thing I think. :)		"Yesss, that top looks so good!  Where'd you pick that up?
You are so handsome and I have the biggest crush 😍
Suits you so well!! 💛
Ohhhhhh oh my god! You look wonderful I just love the color of your hair. I usually wear big baggy polos now I want a cropped one too. You rock it
This store called Tilly's, I'd never shopped there before but they had a lot of fun gendery things haha.
Oh wow my heart 🥺 thank you ❣️
Thank you for sharing~"	qg5jak	NonBinary	124	0.99	2021-10-26 12:40:48

Got a new haircut for my dysphoria and did my makeup (kinda went for a kpop look)		"That's a very gay look
You look badass, super androgynous!! ✨
Nailed it! You're beautiful:)
i love it 😍
Wow you look stunning! 
yes. yes to everything. the eyebrows are looking fuckin fierce & that haircut is really giving me that kpop dreamboat vibe. 
Looking like a snack! I love!!!
you look so ethereal 😍💕✨
I bet if you had some glasses of some sort it would look 10x better. Still good. Proud of you bro.
why thank you 🏳️‍🌈
thanks!!
You're so kind :)
thx❤️
Thanks so much!!
haha thanks!! i actually didn't do anything to my eyebrows. i wish they were more arched :(
that's such a nice compliment! 🖤
I don't need glasses so i feel stupid if i wear them
♡
extremely handsome 💀
May I ask how long you've been nonbinary? I'm trying to feminize myself in little ways, I only recently started exploring myself
I can relate!!! a good arch is undeniable but I like straight eyebrows a lot, too. it’s a cool look!
it’s the feeling I definitely feel looking at you :) 
💖💖💖
I publicly came out as trans nonbinary in August, so like three months, although I had come out to close friends before then. I usually present masc but I sometimes wear makeup which makes me look a little more feminine. 
😭💖
Wow! I just wanna say you're really brave for being yourself like that 😊 and in my opinion ya have a really nice blend of gender aesthetics and I aspire to be as androgynous as you 😊
Thanks! I'm sure you can be even more androgynous than me haha.
Oof I wish 😅 
You got discord or snapchat?
no I'm not hip enough haha

Not nonbinary enough	"I'm older (in my 40's) and have been identifying as nonbinary for a couple of years. I look back on my 20's and remember doing my gender as something I was doing wrong. At one point, I checked out books on masculinity so I can figure out how to get better at being a man. However, my dysphoria is all social and not physical at all. In fact, since being more comfortable in my gender expression (jewelry, nails, clothes from (women section), I feel more comfortable my body. Hell, I even still have my beard, and I can't but help feel that I'm not really nonbinary. 

Which is funny, because most of the people I'm around are cishet, and either see me as non-binary or as ""too queer"". But I also don't want to do things that are not authentic just to perform non-binaryness, because that seems just as bad as being closeted. Well, maybe not as bad lol. Anyway, I really just wanted to get people's perspective on how to feel non-binary enough or trans enough, even if your authentic self doesn't quite match social expectations."	"i’d say there’s really no right way to be non-binary. you give it it’s own meaning. it simply means that you dont exclusively identify as a specific gender. with that said, the way you express yourself is up to you. you don’t have to look a certain way to be considered non-binary. just dress and identify with whatever makes you comfortable.
I am non-binary. Agender to be exact. Also AMAB. I also look AMAB and dress as gender neutral as I can. I don’t want to put a spotlight on my gender as that causes me social dysphoria. I do have some physical dysphoria that I manage without HRT.

Despite the above, I am still absolutely trans. I have zero connection to being male. If I woke up female, I would not care. Most of my early memories were about gender. I have tons in common with other trans people… it is just that there is nothing to transition to that would be better than what I am now. And, as I want to never discuss and downplay my gender, the solution is to blend in as much as possible.

Still trans, though. You are valid.

Best to you...
I self identify as a gender nonconfomist. 

It's nonbinary enough to get called NB by a trans friend.  Until that moment a year ago,  nonbinary was an unknown term to me. 

You are nonbinary enough to call yourself nonbinary.

Anyone saying otherwise Is a gatekeeping bully.
Arrrgh! Yes, social dysphoria! That's a thing! 

I need to process this a bit.
Sometimes I prefer ""genderqueer"" over ""nonbinary"" because of this question. With ""nonbinary"", a lot of people seem to expect an ideal of androgyny, a perfect middle ground. Wheras with ""genderqueer""...it seems to inherently expect messiness, subvert expectation, and rebel against any sort of categorization.

Which is to say that when I'm faced with the feeling of insufficiency, I think it makes more sense to change my perspective than to change my behavior.
Hi, I'm a baby enby, still trying to figure out my identity, and I want to say that reading your post helped ME feel validated. I've been feeling very dysphoric lately and the thing that has been confusing me is that it's not body dysphoria. I like my body and how it looks. I even enjoy having a beard. But it's all social. And I've always had this feeling that expressing myself more femininely will help me get more comfortable with my masculinity. And the fact that you just said that helped me feel so validated. There's no one way to be nonbinary. The same way there's no one way to be any gender. There's no such thing as nonbinary enough or trans enough. You are nonbinary because you say you're nonbinary. And as long as YOU'RE comfortable with that identity and label, it doesn't matter what anyone else says.
Well I’ve recently picked up a book of memoirs from other non-binary people about their experiences with their gender I’m only a few chapters in but I see something of myself in all that I’ve read so far.

NonBinary: Memoirs of Gender and Identity edited by Micah Rajunov and Scott Duane
Absolutely same. I'm 42 and have known gender wasn't a thing I wanted to particularly take a side on since I was tiny, but still feel like I'm ""doing it wrong"" even though there's no test or bar or setting where you hit the Exact Right Amount of Nonbinary-ness. I know that if you say ""I'm nonbinary"" then that's plenty nonbinary enough. But it feels like it's always always easier to tell someone else that than to take the same knowledge to heart personally. But you are absolutely nonbinary AND trans enough and definitely not too queer. Social expectations for gender are like a complicated math math problem that people expect you to do in pen in front of other people.
Being non-binary “enough” is about being *you*, whoever that is. You don’t have to keep labeling yourself as it if you don’t want to, because it’s really more just a statement of “but man or woman aren’t comfortable boxes, I’m going to go ahead and be outside them!”
beards are non-binary as fuck
I think there's always a tension between three factors for anyone that is part of the LGBTQIA2S+ community expressing themselves: Your sense of being true to your authentic self, signals of in group membership within a community, and out-group perception of your identity.

To me the only truly important factor that makes someone nonbinary is the first. Nobody else gets to decide if you are nonbinary enough, or in the right way. Other people can decide to discriminate against you, by policing their idea of what nonbinary is or should be, but that doesn't erase who you know yourself to be.

You are just as valid as nonbinary as anyone here. The label is there to serve you, you don't serve it.
Personally I think of non-binary as being a third gender. And whose to say what the norms are for that third gender? You get to be however you want and set the norms for yourself. I think a lot of people become more comfortable with things that are traditionally part of their agab when they start feeling free to present in some ways as more a different gender. So liking your beard and being fine with it if you wear dresses and nail polish is a normal experience.
No right or wrong way.  Just be you. You define you,  not masses.
Just got to remember that non-binary is a personal interpretation of yourself. It's not a look, fashion style, statement, or anything physical, so there's nothing for other people to judge. You just keep doing you do and the haters can fuck off for judging what makes you happy.
I’m 47. From like 18 to 28 yrs old I was totally Ace. But, at that time, pre internet, I don’t even think that word existed let alone community support. It’s like, I went thru this period of my life without even knowing wtf! Lol. It’s weird to think about it now, knowing what I know now. Perspective ❤️
So I have to ask, ""non-binary enough"" for whom? It sounds like you're plenty NB for your peers, and that you're doing what makes you feel comfortable in your body as far as gender expression goes. I don't think I've ever seen anyone in the NB/genderqueer community policing someone else's gender expression as not being NB/genderqueer ""enough"". So where is the judgment coming from?

I ask this as someone who struggles with the same insecurities and is only recently out as agender with a preference for genderqueer expression, and I think it's a common insecurity (I mean how many NB folx also have anxiety, depression, or other neurodivergencies that are prone to causing insecurity?). But I deal with it by trying to unpack it and figure out who I actually expect to be judging me. Usually I can't actually think of anyone real, it's more of just a ""phantom"" of the queer community at large, which is kinda silly when I think about it, given how welcoming I've always found the queer community (even back when I hadn't figured out I was neither cis nor hetero, lol).

Probably also worth noting that nonbinary doesn't mean ""as far from both male and female as possible"". You can be nonbinary while being ""mostly"" masc or ""mostly"" fem (demiboys and demigirls are nonbinary!). All it takes is to not fully connect with either end of the male-female spectrum. It's basically impossible to not be ""nonbinary enough"", since even the smallest disconnection from the binary is all it really takes. Kinda like how there are no integers between 0 and 1...no matter how close a number is to either of those, it's not an integer (if that helps make sense at all?)
You are already non-binary enough but Just play with it I don’t know where you are in ur gender exploration but have you tired growing ur hair out? Picking a more gender neutral name? Pronoun pins? also I think it’s really cool to see a non-binary person over the age of 25 lol
Feeling this.
I like to think I'm just me.
You just summarized my entire self discovery. Now that you say it, even down to the low level physical dysphoria which i can manage without hrt... wow.
Non-binary isn't a third gender, it's an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of gender identities and expressions, including not identifying with any gender. If you consider yourself a third gender that's valid, but it does not apply to all non-binary people.

Sorry to be pedantic, I just feel like this kind of thinking is what makes people think there's a ""right"" way to be non-binary. Also I do not identify with a third gender and I don't want people to think that's what I mean when I use the non-binary label.
Happy to help… If this describes how you feel, you might look into /r/agender.  You  might  find  others  who  you  can  relate  to.

Also happy to chat more.

Best to you…
That is entirely fair. It is an umbrella term. Sorry to make you feel uncomfortable!
Oh i know that agender describes me best as a label, but i personally stick to just nonbinary. I don't feel the need to go into detail, so umbrella term it is!

I just never knew i actually had dysphoria at all, but now i realize i do. Not a lot or bad, but i do have some.

Also, on most trans subreddits (including agender) people deal with tons of dysphoria, which i don't really, it's quite minor. So it's actually a bit depressing seeing so many people suffer that much in their bodies, which is why i don't go anywhere except the nonbinary subreddit and r/traa for the memes.
No problem, thanks for taking this into consideration :)
Dysphoria is terrible. I have had some bad… bouts of it, again, mostly from social dysphoria issues. For example, I used to have to wear suits to work. Buying them was a nightmare for me. I would have to drink a glass of wine to be able to do it. I never understood the reason why until I realized I was trans. Other clothes didn’t cause me these issues. I just thought I was having some weird anxiety. Turns out, the issue was me buying clothes that specifically gendered myself male. I no longer wear suits.

On the agender subreddit, there are a good number who have mild or no dysphoria. No reason to feel guilt about having it only mildly. Dysphoria of any form is not required to be trans.

Best to you…
No logical reason for guilt, sure, but since when are feelings reasonable? I do feel guilty, or more like bad for those that have it worse i suppose, so i avoid these subreddits, easy as that.
Lol… true. Feelings are rarely logical. I hate that others are suffering too. I remember when I first came to realize I was trans. It was a rather traumatic experience, unfortunately, and I felt very much alone. I now try to help people… and that is both affirming to me and helpful to them. So, a win-win. Lots of people need help and I am happy to offer it. 

Best to you…
Yeah, so much of transness is based on dysphoria, which IMO comes from the history of gatekeeping by the medical/mental health world. While i know how problematic that is, it's still the narrative I have in my head, which is why those feelings come up I think."	wu0gxd	NonBinary	121	1.0	2022-08-21 14:07:52
hard day, such dysphoria, very wow		You look fantastic and happy in this picture. But if it gives dysphoria then 💯 support you in finding a new style to make you feel comfortable and fantastic.	jrbdjk	NonBinary	125	0.99	2020-11-10 01:34:56
Is being repulsed by reproduction and pregnancy common amongst nonbinaries?	"So I'm an afab enby and the idea of being pregnant has made me uncomfortable beyond belief my entire life, to the point where I would rather remove my uterus myself than grow a fetus. 
I was curious if this was just me or if it's possibly a form of gender dysphoria? Seeing as pregnancy is very much connected to womanhood and impegnating someone is connected to manhood. 

How do you feel about it?

(Super cool if you're ok with/enjoy pregnancy! You are awesome!)"	"This is a common form of gender dysphoria, especially given how gendered pregnancy is in society.

I don't share this particular concern though. I'm infertile but would have liked to carry a child as a non-binary parent. I don't discount the struggle that you're experiencing, but there are people out there with the opposite struggle to. Stay strong, friend.
I plan to have a biological child. Personally I am comfortable that I will be pregnant in the future and I will have a butch pregnancy.

Socially I'm not sure how I will like the way I'll be perceived in public. Similar to how I don't like when people in public perceive my breasts but I am personally comfortable with my breasts. I have butch breasts.

Edit: I also want to point out that impregnating =/= manhood. A woman can impregnate her partner. 🙂
The thought of being pregnant sounds horrible to me, nothing about it sounds nice or pleasant. And the whole giving birth thing, nah, no thanks.

It's not just for gender reasons tho, but it does play a role. I just wouldn't want to put my body through that.
I feel the same as you, can't really explain why. The thought is just pure horror to me. I'm also afab nonbinary.
Gosh I'd do a lot to be able to get pregnant. Coming from an amab perspective though.
 I have an intense fear of pregnancy and have had one for much of my life. Ironically, I enjoy being around babies a lot- I just never want to have one.
I literally figured out I was nonbinary through unpacking how I felt about the idea of becoming pregnant or giving birth, so it's definitely not just you! I consider it a major portion of my dysphoria.
yes. i experience this. i literally just got off the phone to make an appointment for a tubal ligation consultation so that I never have to think about the fact that my body can get pregnant ever again. the thing that makes it obviously dysphoria for me is that the repulsion has nothing to do with other people, only about the thought of it happening to myself. I’m not grossed out by the thought of other people being pregnant or giving birth - in fact i think the process is kinda fascinating - it’s just that when i think about it happening to me…nope. that ish makes me wanna vomit.
I'm fully in the boat of not wanting to be pregnant. The idea of being pregnant and giving birth horrifies and disgusts me. I've always felt this way, even before I knew I was non-binary. I take it as a comfort now that I know I'm not a woman. 

I have every respect for anyone who wants to bear children, but it's just not for me. Kudos to those who can and do.
I guess I am mildly repulsed by it, but I haven't had to deal with it personally as I'm infertile. That's probably why it's a mild repulsion for me as I don't have to worry about it happening for me.
Me, a genderfluid person: *screams*

(So ... yes. And also no. And then yes again. Good thing my genes are not prime reproduction material, because adopting is my favourite option right now. And I got a mirena because my uterus wants to bleed me out and kill me, so that helps with the random bouts of horror that happen for no reason because we're in a pandemic and even before that I haven't gotten laid.)
Yes I am also AFAB and hate the idea of pregnancy. I'm planning on being childfree forever
Also an AFAB enby, I’ve always been repulsed by pregnancy, but never considered it part of my own gender dysphoria. Though I see how it could contribute. 🤔
I am very repulsed by it. But I think that's more to do with family trauma than anything else.
I appreciate it when interesting discourse like this happens on the sub. While I’m very much the opposite of you, I love hearing about other enbies’ relationships with gender and societal norms and biology n shit.
I definitely understand this. I’ve felt the same ever since I learned how pregnancy worked when I was a little kid. When I was a teenager, I spent hours online and reading medical books trying to find some way to qualify for a hysterectomy (or somehow trade places with someone who wanted to get pregnant, but couldn’t), then I cried when I didn’t find anything. Thinking back, that was probably my first experience with gender dysphoria.

Plus, it didn’t help that the whole pregnancy experience is super feminized in our society.
I'm AFAB as well and agree with the people who feel repulsed by the idea that my body can be impregnated. It feels wrong, like another user said, like it shouldn't be able to do that.

My question is if anyone else feels dysphoric when they menstruate? I kinda have to disassociate when it happens and just pretend it's normal but it also doesn't feel right for me. Wondering if anyone else experiences something similar.
You’re not alone friend.
Yeah I absolutely hate the idea of ever being pregnant. There was a bit of time where I was kind of into it when I was dating my boyfriend just because I was interested to see what a mixture of us would look like, but at this point if I really wanted that I would get like a surrogate or something. I mostly just want to foster and adopt.

I honestly don't know how much even has to do with gender, but the idea of having to go through a pregnancy makes me like feel icky. Like I don't trust my body in that way, and I have a good relationship with my body so idk what it is.
Not so much hate or repulsed by the idea, moreso borderline phobia. It spikes my anxiety just hearing people talk about pregnancy and before I got my tubes tied there was so much stress attached to ""I could get pregnant"" even before I got sexual with anyone.
as an afab enby going through a miscarriage, it’s the best thing that could’ve happened to me. i’ve been on hormonal birth control for five and a half years (replacing sooner than anticipated bc of the aforementioned situation) and when it failed… and before i knew it had failed/knew i was miscarrying, i had the worst depressive/su*c*dal episode since before i was 20. 

i’m citing my gender as a reason i need fixed, because there isn’t a chance in hell i’m going to reproduce. it feels wrong. i’m very happy with my physical body aside from its biological function. 

so yes, i do believe that for at least a portion of afab enby people, pregnancy is repulsive
glad someone else said it

the idea of being pregnant/giving birth/etc. literally disgusts me and makes me so uncomfortable

i never connected those feeling to gender dysphoria before but that actually makes a lot of sense
Not just you!! I hated this for years and assumed I was asexual but didn't understand why I was still sexually aroused. I realized that it was the gendered aspect of sex and specifically reproduction/ pregnancy/ children that bothered me. 

It took talking to a therapist to figure it out fully so don't feel bad that you have been confused!! I think confusion is an Enby’s first emotion.
Yep. 💯 The best way I’ve been able to explain it to anyone is that to me it seems like a type of non-consensual body modification. It’s not that I don’t like kids? They’re okay, and I used to teach kids classes and really enjoyed it. It’s just that thought of me going through it makes me super uncomfortable. This doesn’t just apply to me, though, I recently had a coworker who was pregnant and found the whole thing horrifying on her behalf. Can it extend to other people? Lol.
I was thoroughly repulsed by the thought of pregnancy, but then I realized I wanted to be a parent and I was too poor to adopt or rent a uterus. It got to the point where the idea of having a kid felt more important than the dysphoria I’d go through for nine months, so I had a kid. Being pregnant didn’t feel feminine or womanly at all, I just felt like me, using my gonads and hosting a human. Yes, there was some dysphoria but I knew it was going to end, and it was worth going through.
Did not know this was as common as it is, but I DEFINITELY have this.
I'm repulsed by it. I've had a hysterectomy and I'm glad that I can't reproduce. Like I'm not interested in sex anyway, but I feel like that's just something that my body is not supposed to be able to do.
I feel complete aversion about it, the thought horrifies me. That combined with family issues - I'd do all I can to never get pregnant by any chance. Cool to know I'm not alone on that
I have whatever you have it absolutely disgusts me and the thought of being “fertile” just makes me cringe it quiet Litterly triggers me to think about periods and all that like the same feeling u get when u scrape a plate with ur fork i just want to bite my fingernails off
I want a child but part of the fears is suddenly gaining the name ""mommy"" or being praised for all these feminine nurturing aspects of being a good ""mom"". It KILLS me on the inside. 

I can just see myself now giving birth and the nurse telling me ""oh good job mama"". 

From my friends who are also non-binary they feel the same.
I'm definitely repulsed by the idea of being pregnant. It's a wonder that I didn't identify that feeling as part of my gender dysphoria earlier in life. I argued with doctors for nearly a decade before getting approved for a bilateral salpingectomy. I wanted that form of sterilization specifically because it has the highest success rate besides a total hysterectomy, which absolutely no one would even consider approving for me. I do think it's probably a fairly common occurrence for AFAB nonbinary people but I wouldn't say it's a majority or anything like that.
I've known I would never carry a child since I was 9 and didnt even actually understand how any of it worked, just that that's something my body was ""meant"" to do. It was really just an uncomfortable thing, like why would I make life harder on myself for that? Especially when theres more than plenty of kids to adopt and foster and all. It turned to disgust when I was older, maybe 15 or 16 and had began to realize I wasnt cis. And when I got closer and closer to the age where it was expected of me. As it stands currently, at the age of 22 and 6 months on t + one year post top surgery, I would sooner gut myself than carry a child. I am paranoid about it happening. I had a ""scare"" (something nobody in their right mind would have considered a scare, but being a person who would die before getting pregnant, my concern seemed reasonable at the time) and I was dysphoric and depressed in a ball on my bed for 2 weeks, even after taking a pregnancy test and it being negative. 

So. Idk if disgust/repulsion is ""normal"" in nonbinary people, but I am definitely part of the population that that is true for.
yea I am also afab and this happens to me.
The thought of carrying a baby scares the shit out of me. So many things can go wrong and pushing a baby out...yeah no thanks. Also I feel like having something kick inside you has to be creepy af. 


My maternal side manifests itself through breeding birds sometimes. Watching and documenting their growth was amazing
I've felt the same way since I was a child, I just knew I never wanted to reproduce for so many reasons. I saw other family members get pregnant & it grossed me out. I also received way too much information from my mother about all things related to pregnancy & periods from when I was really young. It all revolted me, even though I did not come out as NB until I was 44 which was four years ago. Now I am probably one of the few people actually looking forward to menopause, LOL. Hopefully it's coming soon...apparently it can having a masculinizing effect on some people, so...even better!

I did not realize I had gender dysphoria at all until 2017, although I'd been suffering from it for four decades about stuff like pregnancy, periods, chest, etc. I'm fine with my downstairs equipment, it is what it is, but the inside plumbing grosses me out, especially since it's caused me so much pain, discomfort, & inconvenience every month since I was just 11 years old.

For all the folks who are into having babies, that's all good too - each to their own is my belief, because folks need to be true to themselves. Being free to make your own choices about your own body is crucial!

Being NB is so much about figuring out what feels right & comfortable to you as an individual...we're all doing it the best we can with whatever resources we have, so there's truly no right or wrong way to do it. There isn't (& shouldn't be) a pre - written script to follow. It's all about being who you are & living your best life. For me, that's meant not conforming to the many expectations placed on female - bodied people, even before I figured out I was NB.
So, I've had two babies, both before I had even begun realizing that I was nonbinary/trans.  The 2nd pregnancy was after I got my ostomy and I had medical issues related to that, the first was perfectly smooth.  Both time I had a strong sense that there was an alien lifeform inside me lol.  It really freaked me out, the sense of never being alone, that there was something growing in there, and that my body was changing and everyone could see I was pregnant.  I also had major mood drops when my milk let down which led to me not breastfeeding my 2nd at all past the first day.  
I kind of just though I wasn't wired right and was failing at all of the things my mom and others did super well with, but now I wonder if it had to do with my then-unknown gender stuff.  

Side note, I was happy to be pregnant both times, because I wanted the babies, and I do love both my little guys so much, but I've always felt I didn't do things quite right because of the way I felt and felt sort of deficient.
Yeah. While I personally am not especially repulsed by the idea of pregnancy and reproduction. I am repulsed by the idea of sex (especially by the idea of myself/ or a body similar to my current/birth one). In part it comes from me being Asexual, but I think the actively repulsed part is gender dysphoria.) The nearer a hypothetical sex scenario gets to involving body's less similar to my current body and more similar to my mental nonbinary body the less actively repulsed by it I become. (Still not attracted just less grossed out)).
I don't know but it very much repulses me too and I can't wait to be a bit older and have the option to have an hysterectomy. That makes two of us
I'm AFAB and I'm transmasculine agender. I have had 2 kids before transitioning and I personally wish my body would allow me to have more but my last pregnancy almost killed me. When I was talking to my gender affirming doctor he mentioned that it's pretty normal to have dysphoria in that area and not every transmasculine person wants to have kids and I was more of an odd ball than I thought
I felt similar about this for so many years before I finally did something about it, just like the idea of getting someone pregnant (in real life) has always been horrifying to me.
Well I personally want to have that experience someday, although I do have mixed feelings about it at the same time. I don't think that's an all encompassing every enby likes or doesn't like... Honestly there's very few things that are. All of us are unique and different in some way or another. I think we should just embrace who we are, and accept everyone else for who they are. That's just my thoughts on the matter, anyway.
I wanted to remove my reproductive organs at age 12, because the thought of being pregnant was nauseating. I still have my organs, but I am also on T have no period whatsoever and no troubles with pain, so I‘ll probably keep them until a gyn tells me to remove them for health reasons. 

I don‘t really think of pregnancy being something gendered (sound weird) but more of something with bodies and well, I’m ace, autistic and would be much happier being born with a male body. So pregnancy is a no-no for me
Oh, yep. I thought I was over it and got pregnant, was miserable the whole time. Egg me thought it was just heebie jeebies from having a living thing inside me, hatched egg me realizes it was dysphoria. I yeeted my uterus 3 months after giving birth. No regrets there. And while I don't regret my baby, he's so precious and holds the biggest chunk of my heart, I wouldn't make the same decision again if I had known them what I do now about myself.
I'm sorry you weren't given the chance to create a life, if I could break the universes rules and swap places with you I would. I'm sure you will be/are an amazing parent
Butch breasts, I love that sm! Goodluck with your butch pregnancy too :D
This is very close to how I feel too! I think I will love the experience with my husband. But being perceived outside I’m afraid it will push me into the “feminine range” constantly and be exhausting.
I will trade my possible fertility for your infertility lol. Although idk how many eggs I have left because I had to get chemo done a little while back
Same.. I don't even know if I want kids but being able to carry one would be nice.
There are current studies about transplanting healthy uteruses into afab folx. I keep hoping that this will lead to transplants into amab folx. I know this doesn't help now, but it gives me hope that one day people like me could give up their uterus to trans women and amab enbies.
I know exactly how you feel, I love kids and might adopt but just... _can't_ carry them myself
This also contributed to my coming out to myself as non-binary! Realizing this could be disphoria also made me feel a lot more normal, like as a kid my cis friends loved pretending to be pregnant and it made me sooo uncomfortable
I relate so much, it's really cool to know I'm not alone in feeling this way!
Haha sounds so chaotic I love it! Hope you get to adopt oneday you sound like you'd be a very fun parent :))
Yeah there have been a ton of interesting answers to this post and I'm really enjoying seeing everyone's experiences :)
Super cool that you want to be pregnant btw, I respect that a lot
I'm glad you eventually found your authentic self and figured out why you feel this way 💜💛
I'm ok with menstruating but I have heard a lot of other people say they have dysphoria about it. Maybe you can make a post about it? A lot of people said they enjoy having these types of discussions and I find them very interesting.
I do get weirded out when other people are pregnant around me, like my teacher was pregnant and whenever she talked about it I was like aaaaaaaaaaaa. It's gotten better since I realized I'm not attracted to men and have no chance of falling pregnant though. If other people are cool with it then good for them, just don't have a ton of kids and overpopulate the planet too much lol
Well done for getting through it, that's amazing!
I don't think there is a ""right"" way to have a child, as long as you love them with all your heart (which I'm certain you do) you are a wonderful parent. It's amazing for you to get past the disphoria and have that connection with your children <3
That's cool! I'm glad you were able to have your kids.
I agree, it has been really interesting to see so many different perspectives. We're all just a little bit different and that's wonderful
Aww thanks
Thank you! 🙂
Having been pregnant with a beard, even just the constant “mother” this and “pregnant women” that in all the paperwork and medical shit you go through while pregnant was exhausting in itself. It was worth it though, pregnancy has an end date.
as an afab person trying to get sterilized, i’ve found the solution /s. i’m proud of you for beating cancer’s ass, and i wish you the best
I’d love to live in a world where cis-Amabs can carry a child to term. A lot of prejudice wouldn’t be a thing by then
 Exactly!! I'm a nursing student and I absolutely adored my experience on a maternity wing. Best of luck if you end up adopting!
Yeah, it's weird because it's totally within the realm of possible cis experience to loathe the idea of being pregnant, but I feel deeply certain that the way I feel about it is specifically dysphoria - it's the feeling of ""my body *should not be able to do that*"" that gets me.
Well I sure hope I'll be 😅

Though I need a lot more time before I'm ready to adopt. If I do have kids someday, they'll be welcomed into an established home that is fully ready for them.
Thank you! And of course I respect how you feel about it as well, plus it’s brave to put yourself out there like that. Enbies should have other enbies’ backs!
Thank you so much! I’m glad you found yourself too. 💛🤍💜🖤
Ah okay. It’s nice to know I’m not the only one who feels this way then. Thanks for making this topic.
Thank you so much for saying that, you are very kind.    Being a parent in my experience comes with tons of self doubt (I don't necessarily think that's universal, I don't want to put anyone off of having kids lol, I've got mental health issues in addition to gender stuff) but I am working on it daily.  ❤️
You can have my uterus too if theirs doesn't work out!
Thanks!! Funniest thing was they offered up a solution of freezing some of my eggs for $13000, I was like hell no, let these fuckers burn lmaoo
Thank you! :D You're gonna be an awesome nurse!
Very responsible, I stand by on my belief that you'll make a good parent
Yeeees omw I love this community so much everyone is so sweet and respectful and I always feel like I have support and love supporting others!
You're doing great, and your kids are lucky to have you 💜
“you can procreate for the low low price of 13K, how’s that!” uhhhhh that’s my entire yearly rent so imma have to go with no
Thank you so much ❤️

8 Years of AFAB non-binary medical transition <3	" 

Hi Everyone! TLDR: I'm AFAB and 8 years into non-binary transition and I want to tell you what I did/am doing because I wish I had access to this information in the beginning! Pronoun town: they/them

What it means for me to be non-binary is secondary sex characteristics give me dysphoria. When I started T I thought I would just pass as a man over time and didn't feel good about it. Turns out that's definitely not what's happening for me- which I personally really works for me. 

I've been on T for 8 years. I am non-binary and going on T was an experiment for me. I started with a cream and changed to a shot later. As soon as I had enough T in my system to feel the effects I realized I wasn't depressed anymore and it completely changed my emotional landscape in a way that was amazing.

I was started to have hair loss (runs in the family) and that's a dysphoria nightmare for me so I have been on Finasteride for about 7 years. It prevents balding and also slows the growth of facial and body hair. It can also slow clitoral growth but it that's already happened for you it tends to not affect it. Finasteride can affect people's sex drives but it's never had any side effects for me. If you get the bigger pills and cut them into fourths it's way cheaper. Finasteride prevents you from losing your hair and will help some of it grow back. You have to stay on it as long as you're on T. My hairline has changed and I've had a little bit of hair loss but otherwise I'm so grateful for Finasteride!

I went on shots around 1 year in. I was still having periods and I increased my T really gradually in order to be on the lowest amount I could while not bleeding. That turned into a years long problem because I had a high red blood cell count when on enough to stop bleeding but then every time I lowered it I would get my period which was the worst. I tried to get an IUD (Mirena) but this just gave me horrible cramps everyday for 3 months so I got it out and decided to get a hysto. I got a laproscopic hysto and it was so chill and easy!

I just have tiny little scars on my abdomen because they take it out trans vaginally. Recovery was really fine- I was off opiate pain meds within three days. I decided to get out my uterus and my cervix and kept my ovaries (in case I go off T someday). You have to have some sex hormones in your body for bone health so I wanted to make sure I didn't have to take E later if I wanted to switch it up.

This was covered my insurance (Kaiser) after providing letters from therapists. I kept my letters binary because I don't trust insurance companies to understand or respect non-binary transition.

For some people their cervix can feel like part of sexual pleasure and they want to keep it. Orgasms change because it turns out uterine spasms are part of orgasms- but honestly it's all good. And talking to other folks too- we have no regrets.

Getting a hysto was so that I could be on a lower dose of T and not worry about bleeding. I'm currently on .25 a week.

I changed my shots from IM to sub cu in the last 6 months. It turns out that Dr Joanna Olsen (an amazing doctor for trans youth in LA) has discovered that IM has really sped up the hair loss process for people because it results in a really high spike of DHT each time you do a shot-which is what causes balding. She thinks since she's switching her patients to sub-cu she's going to see a lot less hair loss.

I am Italian so body hair and facial hair is REAL. And gives me a lot of dysphoria. After being able to get a hysto and be on less T I decided to get laser on my torso and face. I got a groupon kind of deal so it was half off. Laser hurts real bad but it's pretty effective. I might do electrolysis in the future since laser is semi-permanent. 

I wish I had gotten a hysto within my first year of being on T- if I had then I would've stayed on the cream based T and on a low dose. The cream works a lot slower and so does being on a low dose- and is recommended for folks who want to be on T but don't want facial hair growth. I just didn't want to bleed- and I wish someone had told me how easy and great a hysto could be.

Since I was able to get laser I felt like I could move ahead with top surgery. Since I don't want to be perceived as a man or a woman my dysphoria is really about balancing that. I got top surgery about a year ago and it's so nice to not have dysphoria about my chest. 

I decided to go with Dr. Mangubat in Tukwila, WA. I have mixed feelings about my experience but the reason I went with him is it seemed more likely that I would have nipple sensation and I do. Nipple sensation is really important to me and I really still have it. I wish this was something we talked more about and I wish the scientific world studied things like this to figure out how trans people can still experience pleasure.

After electrolysis (I never want to shave my face again!) I think I'll be done with the 1000 step process of non-binary transition. I'm femme so in the world in general people usually call me she- which tbh is less dysphoric than being called he. Sometimes people think I'm trans-feminine and in general even trans folks can't tell which direction I'm transitioning. So I pretty much have reached androgynous angel level- that is my dream.  <3<3<3 feel free to ask questions and share this info. The biggest thing for me is I always wished I had done this steps earlier- because I feel so much better now. <3 also feel free to to share this  with other folks!"	"Thank you so much for sharing your detailed write-up. Great to hear it's gone well!
What’s been your experiment with fat redistribution? I’m over a year on low dose gel and I find I’ve gotten to a point where I don’t like how my fat has concentrated on my gut — working out more would probably help, but I struggle with chronic pain and I don’t want to hurt myself from exercising too hard. So I’m thinking that might be a reason to stop T soon. I’m also getting sick of the acne and increasing facial/body hair, but I’m worried that my dysphoria and anxiety will get worse if I go off T now :/
Thanks for giving so much information! It seems like overall you’ve really found what works for you. Where I’m at, I’ve known I’m non-binary the same length of time you’ve been transitioning, but between being closeted for work and uncertainty about what my transition goals would even be, I’m stuck in this spot where I assume I’m never going to do something that would be considered medically transitioning.

How were you able to decide what the right steps for you were? Did it involve work with a gender therapist or was it solo?
This is very personal so feel free to ignore or tell me to fuck off if you're not comfortable answering - but what's it feel like having a vagina with no cervix?  I've always been curious about how that all works as far as hysterectomies go, I just can't imagine reaching up there and not feeling my cervix at the end.  It's obviously a common surgery for a lot of reasons but trying to visualize the after product is just bizarre, I can't quite wrap my head around it.
Thank you for sharing in such detail -- I've been struggling lately with a lot of feels around the idea of HRT, and there aren't a ton of resources regarding n.b. low-dose T. Particularly the info about hair loss/hair growth (hair is probably the biggest anxiety I have re: taking T).

If you don't mind me asking, did you notice any change in your voice? How dramatic was it?
Hey, thank you for writing this hugely informative post! I’ve been reading up on non-binary people taking smaller amounts of T to get a better sense of transition options. I don’t mind the idea of getting hairier but hair loss is a personal nightmare! Glad to know it’s something worth discussing with a doc about.
Ahhh omg sorry for the lurk im about two years late but I just came across this since I actually just found out about DHT blockers since my original plan was to micro-dose since there are some effects of T that I don’t really want. This post gave me sm hope that I can achieve androgyny too. While the only surgery I plan on having is top surgery, everything else stated I can relate to. My mind has just been in pain trying to figure out how to start what to do, if it’s even possible to achieve androgyny. So much stuff that I’m kinda like hating myself for being non-binary like life is already so confusing :( and then the judgment of others but anywho thank you for this post! It love to ask you some questions if you’d be okay with it!
I'm very late here, but thank you for sharing all this.

I feel like since I'm on a low dose fat redistribution is less than it would be for me than if I was on a higher dose. I still have hips and a butt which feels important to me gender wise but I certainly have less of both of those things.

I do have a little bit more of a belly and sometimes that is dysphoric for me but our society is so fatphobic that it can be hard to discern what's gender dysphoria and what's dysphoria caused by the expectation that we're all supposed to be skeletons. 

I do exercise in order to balance my gender feelings- I do things to increase glutes which feels important to me. I just want to say I feel you and that bellies rule and are beautiful and to be androgynous we don't all have to be thin, white and hairless. 

When I first started T I was super hungry and ate all the time and did gain some weight. Over time I lost it again.  I don't tend to talk about this part of my transition because of the stigma around not being super skinny/muscular and I don't want to contribute to that but I'm happy to answer questions about that part of my experience. I also gained a lot of muscle (genetics + T) which I'm mostly okay but is sometimes dysphoric for me so I tend to do mostly cardio and not lifting because T makes me build muscle really quickly. 

The acne struggle is REAL. The thing that has really worked for me is sulphur soap. It's made a huge difference: [https://www.amazon.com/Pack-Premium-Sulfur-Soap-Cleansing/dp/B00DSOI73W](https://www.amazon.com/Pack-Premium-Sulfur-Soap-Cleansing/dp/B00DSOI73W)

What I use for maintenance of body hair every few days is this: [https://www.target.com/p/philips-norelco-bodygroom-series-7000-men-39-s-rechargeable-electric-trimmer-bg7030-49/-/A-75565979](https://www.target.com/p/philips-norelco-bodygroom-series-7000-men-39-s-rechargeable-electric-trimmer-bg7030-49/-/A-75565979)

When I first started transitioning I just tried to be okay with body hair but as soon as I shaved it all off I felt AMAZING. This shaver has one end that gets a super close shave that's great for body hair. 

My general thoughts are that T makes my emotional landscape so much better and happier that I am able to counter the effects of T that I don't like and that it's worth it. It's scary to medically transition and can feel like a big risk but ultimately I want to be myself and be happy. The weird thing about transition is that it can feel like we're choosing physical characteristics that cis people would just be given and for me it doesn't feel like I have a choice to be on T or not because I am SO sad not being on it. I have definitely been through a process of trying to both treat my dysphoria cause by estrogen based puberty and T and accepting that I also am just a human with a body in a society that's really mean.  It's been really powerful to see images that counteract fatphobia and transphobia. I really recommend following Shoog on Instagram. They do amazing photography of fat queer and trans people that I think is really beautiful and liberating [https://www.teenvogue.com/story/shoog-mcdaniel-fresh-finds](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/shoog-mcdaniel-fresh-finds)
My approach was not with a therapist but I decided to let myself experiment. You can be on low dose hormones for months without ever having to be out to anyone about it but your doctor and you can just see how it feels. Our society is really intense about deciding people will regret transition choices or we'll turn into gender monsters but the truth is there is a lot of flexibility and choice and a lot of things can change and change back. 

I got top surgery and have been on T for almost 9 years and I still get assumed to be a lady all the time so you don't have to assume that you have to be out even if you make the choices you need to in order to transition.

I think it's a lot about listening to yourself outside of what other people think. The only thing I regret is not making these choices sooner because the relief and joy was always greater than the fear and pain that preceded the medical transitions.

 I think seeing images of other people's genders has also been helpful to me in looking at what I might want to look like.
Since this is anonymous I'm happy to share :) It feels great to not have a cervix! I really thought about keeping it (you can get a hysto and keep your cervix) but there is a chance you will still have a small amount of monthly bleeding since it has some cells it would shed, I would still have to get paps (nightmare!) and there can sometimes be complications down the road that result in people having to get their cervix out anyways.

&#x200B;

The vagina gets a tiny bit shorter without a cervix and they suture the top of the vagina and it doesn't really feel different. The top of the vagina after getting your cervix removed is called a cuff which feels right to me in the gender department. In an interesting twist I still feel pleasure specifically where my cuff is during penetration which I feel glad about.

&#x200B;

I did a lot of research and I also visualized what body parts it felt right to me to have and that's how I made my decision. There is an extremely gendered website that i found useful- you have to pretend not to be trans to use it because they are transphobic and will kick you off but since there is barely any research on hystos it helped me: [www.hystersisters.com/](https://www.hystersisters.com/)

&#x200B;

I also heard from someone that there are two different ways that your sutures at the top can be shaped- either a more dome shape or more to a point shape. I haven't done research about that but it would be good to talk to your surgeon. Feel free to ask more questions!
Good question! My voice is a bit lower but I still get called ma'am on the phone (and in real life.) I personally don't make an effort to talk in a lower register. I just talk the way I talk and it's definitely lower than it was which is really nice for me. In the past it was really dysphoric to hear recordings of my voice because it was so high and now I tbh I just sound extremely femme and gay which I think is fun.
You're so welcome! Finasteride is great and very chill in my experience. If I wasn't on Finasteride I would certainly be mostly bald and would've stopped taking T ages ago. I have a male sibling and his hair is pretty much gone and I have grown mine long and I have a lot of it :)"	blvk45	NonBinary	119	1.0	2019-05-07 20:12:43
Dysphoria has been hitting hard recently but felt cute today!		"Cuz u are!
I know what you mean, trans-fem non-binary here. I'm not a gender!, I'm a person damn it! Just because I like to express my physical form as what is considered fem and wear clothes that are considered fem, doesn't mean you should put me in a box and make assumptions about me from my physical appearance.

Mainly I want to distance myself from misogyny and toxic maleness. At the same time I have body dysmorphia and I am transitioning to what is considered to physically be what someone AFAB would generally have what's considered fem physical properties.

Don't know where you are in the non-binary spectrum as it is a very broad term, that can mean very different things to different people. So not sure what your dysphoria is about, but that's my experience if it helps at all.
Your sweater is so cool!
You are so cutee ヾ(≧▽≦\*)o
What a cutie!! Looking awesome☺
Heccin adorable <3
Awww shucks 😊
I’m a fairly fem presenting enby but honestly I would love to just be a genderless potato lol! I’m not out to many people yet so the pronouns and the body dysphoria are what are getting to me atm

It’s nice to find people in the same boat, thank you!! The validation means the world 🖤🖤

transition timeline, ended up being some form of bigender once the dysphoria calmed down but happy with the physical results		"Idk I'm just happy with one thing about myself for once. 

Before I was used to people expressly using she to misgender me, if a stranger or someone I'm not close to does it I wanna knock teeth out for obvious reasons, but I've gotten more comfortable with close friends switching up a bit with he/she/they.

 Even tried making my own set of pronouns or using zombie/revenant themed ones(I relate to the ghouls from fallout alot don't ask me why) but they haven't caught on. 

I prefer they in online spaces where I don't know people just because I again don't like when it comes from a place where I'm intentionally being misgendered and am iffy about strangers he/she-ing me

2-3 years after realizing I was trans I thought I had to either overcompensate in myself or put others down in my own mind for Thier expressions of gender not fitting what I thought was my own view.

I was so desperate to beat out social dysphoria that I ended up talking shit about other people. 

It was always in private but I know from how I've heard others talk about me in private it was shitty. 

I finally feel safe enough not having to overcompensate my masculinity constantly.

I love having a big beard and the body of a grizzly bear but I also love being non-binary. 

I love the duality in my body,

It's  something that would've made me vomit 2 years ago but now it brings me joy.

I don't enjoy my breasts, not how they feel, especially when I'm trying to sleep sideways or binding to go out in public,

However sometimes I catch glimpses of myself shirtless and when I see my face in the mix there's a weird sort of comfort that washes over me. 

When it first happened I was confused. It had been years, I don't think I ever remember a time where I felt comfortable in myself, but suddenly for a moment I did, even with my mismatched parts. 

T made it very hard to cry but I remember crying very hard, I remember asking myself why if I wasn't sad, it was happiness. For the first time in years happiness. 

It took me a good decade to get to this point, I had alot of internalized shit and felt I needed to pigeonhole myself one way or another to make my dysphoria stop being so severe, once I got on hormones that softened from a sharp knife in my ribs to a mild scratch.
I'm jealous of your beard, looks good!
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh why are there *multiple* pictures where you have a cigarette in each nostril? Like I get doing it once but

Just need to vent about gendered body parts	"I’ve been feeling frustrated lately because I’ve come to the realisation that I don’t want top surgery. I like my breasts, they don’t give me any dysphoria, they’re excellent pillows for people to lie on and look killer in a bra.

What I hate about them is how other people see them and decide that the presence of breasts means they have to misgender me. I hate that a flat chest is seen as “neutral” or “androgynous” because I don’t fucking want surgery but I desperately want to stop being misgendered because my chest looks a certain way. I bind occasionally but it’s not comfortable and I’m far from flat chested so they’re super noticeable when I don’t bind.

Anyone else deal with this sort of thing? Have you been able to make peace with it?"	"Totally feel you. I have the man body, as a result of testosterone puberty. I am big and muscly, and I don't particularly hate it. But, it is very masculine. I am too big and too broad shouldered and strong-jawed to be gender neutral. I don't want to do any ffs or hormone replacement for *myself* but I am very aware that everyone is always going to see a dude.

Not exactly the same thing, but I think a similar feeling.
I know even after top surgery I won’t “pass”. I can bind and wear something and be completely flat and sometimes I’ll pass as a guy but like in the places I go there is no “passing” as non-binary (tbh there really shouldn’t be, because like all enbies have such varied presentations, but still) most people just decide “man or woman” and don’t consider anything else. I think it is definitely something to be mad about. Like how closed minded the world is and how we have to try so hard just to be seen in a vaguely authentic way and be given respect. But these are things I am working through with my therapist and as time goes on I’m accepting it more. I don’t think I’ll ever be done being angry about it, but I think that’s justified. I just don’t want to be angry all the time.
I think people are slowly starting to gender body parts less. Especially in the queer community. It definitely helps to surround yourself with people who do see body parts without gender associated. But it will definitely be a while before the rest of society catches on sadly.
You're not alone!  Same! (My boobs I love to use as convenient stash spot for whatever don't fit in my pockets- who needs a wallet haha) 

The only self-consciousness I feel stems from how my ""hourglass"" is viewed by society and others, but personally I like my shape- it just SUCKS that it is automatically seen as feminine.   SO frustrating.    Some days I do feel pretty down about it and also think about top surgery too BUT then comes the internal conflict of ""but I love my boobs, WHY let others take them from me??"" 

Those days when I'm getting dressed I just try to remind myself that it's not a problem with me, it's a problem with others and just hope that society keeps progressing in the right direction when it comes to gender.  I dress myself as if suiting up for war- and I'm the big titty Joan of Arc whose gonna step out onto these streets and correct everyone on who they THINK I am by just representing and being ME.
Yes, absolutely. It brought me to identify with myself as Genderqueer rather than Nonbinary, so as to better represent my true self rather than   trying to occupy some space within other people’s ideals. I am nothing like what society projects onto me. I love my vagina, and I also love my imaginary penis. I won’t have surgery and I am happiest just knowing that I know my self, free from the projected expectations of others.
Yes !!

I like my curvy body.

I hate how society genders it and how it's perceived, but personally I like it.
same!! I dont want to be seen as a woman just because I'm curvy af but at the same time I don't dislike having said curves

honestly I don't think my body has ever looked like 'me' persay but im not dysphoric about it and i appreciate it like a customizable work of art so thats good enough i guess lol
I feel this!! I like my breasts, and sometimes I like to wear a really tight sports bra if I want a more androgynous look that day. But it does suck when pple immediately put a gender on you bc of it. For me I keep reminding myself that even if I was a cis woman the expectations of what I “should be” would be a situation. And I feel it’s diff obv being a non-binary person myself, but pple are going to come to conclusions about who we are all the time. I try to remind myself of who I am, and that it’s my body, my identity. No one can take my truth away from me. Hope things get better <3
I feel constant pressure to bind and such because I worry I'd oversexualise or upset other enby people for existing. 

I'm fine with how my chest is, it's just I don't like how 'cis girl' it makes me look, though that's probably my fault as I like doing things that are considered feminine
Yessss, no I haven't yet tho
Right now I’m suffering from being gendered male, but when my breasts grow larger I’m gonna have the opposite problem... le sigh
well i feel pretty much exactly the same. most of the time i'm fine with my breasts and i think sometimes i would actually like wearing clothes where they are more 'noticeable' but i don't want people to assume i'm a 'girly girl' or whatever. basically i just feel you a lot but unfortunately i have no advise other than try to ignore the ones that make you feel bad :/
sending a hug to you ༼ つ ◕‿◕ ༽つ
you're not alone! my breasts are quite small, so it can be easy for me to appear more flat in different clothing, but i have wide hips & that always gives me away. for a while i thought i needed to hide my figure in order to feel euphoria, despite not ever feeling dysphoria in the first place. felt i always needed a binder & loose clothes. now though? i've come to absolutely adore my body & all it does for me. small tits never make me feel less feminine when that's where i am, and they definitely won't stop me from feeling masc either. i'm so glad to hear that you're accepting yourself! we are here for enbies of ALL bodies
obviously being trans* comes with the weight of knowing that society has gendered soooo many things. i haven't made peace with it, because i still get anxious even being in the passenger's seat without a binder on when my partner is ordering food. i envy anyone who can eventually get to find peace with this but know that its really all in your own head. i imagine it's like skydiving right? its scary each time but after the first one, it becomes a little easier or more familiar.
I see the problem and kinda understand but don't at the same time. It's normal that people will misgender someone if they see that this person has breasts. Other people aren't mind readers, if you don't want them to misgender you then perhaps wear some pronoun stickers. I'm not some petite person and will never be due to my bone structure, I am curvy and have big breasts and not even pixie cut and dressing masculine got anyone to say ""sir"" or something. It's just something you have to accept when going out.
i am like you but the opposite! i’m super short even compared to other afabs, and all my features are extremely rounded, squishy, and soft. so while i don’t mind looking feminine, (in fact some days i wake up feeling super fem) i wish i could have a more androgynous look so that i could even slightly pass as male/nb some days
i can relate to that a lot and i really like your approach of your body being 'a customizable work of art', idk it just makes it sound so beautiful. also it makes me feel as if my body is a canvas that i can do whatever i want with and create an artwork with piercings, tattoos, hair colours etc. (\*´ω｀*)
glad you like it! honestly I think humans are really beautiful and it's really cool that we can customize our bodies like we can. personally i think it would be a shame for me to waste that
yeah i think that too! also i think people 'designing' their own bodies makes them look so beautiful because they look so confident and powerful. i hate that other people try to police how i look and what i do with my body because in a way it takes that confidence away from me. anyway people are beautiful haha
totally agreed!"	np3eg5	NonBinary	112	0.98	2021-05-31 13:27:33
My favorite Picrew! Anyone have tips for managing AFAB face dysphoria?		"Ok but wearing a face mask kills dysphoria and follows cdc guidelines
I'd recommend looking up some contour videos on YouTube. I don't really have a specific way I do mine, but contour definitely helps me
I tend to shave the ""peach fuzz"" off my cheeks and jaw, it's hair that doesn't usually grow the same way on amab folks. There's not that much of a noticeable difference but it somewhat makes me feel better for doing the act and feeling the smoothness !
Recently found this picrew as well and love it! I've made like 8 in the past couple days
ok for me a usually slightly push my jaw out idk if it works for everyone but i figured i might as well put it out there
If you're looking to strengthen your jaw, weaken your eyes, or weaken the mouth, I would contour in attempts accentuate the chin or any smile marks around the mouth and eyes. It can detract from the strong fem features. For the dysphoria, I'm afraid drinking is the only way I can say to dull it down until it passes
i'm sorry i don't have any tips for you, but can i ask you the picrew link?
Thanks! I've attempted it before, but I don't have my own makeup and none of the requisite skill. Might be something to invest in. What kind of powder stuff is used for contouring?
I leave my upper lip and chin unshaved, I think it makes my upper lip hair a bit more noticeable, idk if it actually does tho, but it feels cool
Here it is   [https://picrew.me/image\_maker/114808](https://picrew.me/image_maker/114808)
I tend to stick with cream for contour because it's easy to make it sharp and adjust it to appear like skin. Really like the Fenty Match Stix for that since the shade range is pretty good. Cream to power so it's matte and it's buildable. It's really really easy to use (beginner friendly).
to be honest, I'm not really sure. I know Nyx is a good brand for contour though"	g3q6i2	NonBinary	112	0.95	2020-04-18 16:21:21

insulted by uber eats delivery person	"So yeah as title says, yesterday I ordered food using the uber eats app. That app is great by the way, helps a ton when you're disabled one way or another and can't easily go around and pick up your food yourself.

So then I place the order and wait for it as usual. When the delivery person arrive, first I had to tell them to meet me in front of my apartment building because it is difficult for me to go all the way down to the main portal. I was wearing my socks and pronoun pin because that helped me a little with my constant dysphoria, plus I honestly had forgotten about that. So they finally get to me, probably assume I don't speak one word of english because a lot of people don't where I live, and I clearly heard ""fucking tranner"".

I got so angry I had to hold back from punching them or something. Honestly, just, what the hell! It's my life, I'm not telling people how they should live their life, so why do they feel the need to dictate how I should live my own?

Hot damn. I took the food didn't thank them at all, only told them to keep their nasty comments to themselves next time.

I haven't even found where, if anywhere, I could report something like this. The uber eats app lets me give a thumb down to the delivery person but mostly in relation to the order itself. Nowhere have I seen that one can report harrasment or racism or anything of the sort.

I'm absolutely shocked that in 2022, nearly 2023, people are still getting away with that sort of behavior.

I'm mostly over it by now, but figured I'd still post that to really get it off my chest for good."	"As a long-time food delivery driver, let me first say people suck.  As a little baby enby still questioning the validity of their identity, instead of calling you an insult, I'd like to think I'd go out of my way to say something nice about you instead.
From the Uber Eats website:

>If you are subject to discrimination or witness discriminatory behavior, you can report the incident to Uber by tapping Help in the Uber or Uber Eats app or visiting help.uber.com so that our Support team can follow up and take the appropriate action.

DEFINITELY report it.
I haven’t used Uber Eats but in DoorDash the way you’d report this is “I need help with my order -> It’s something else -> report safety issues”. It’s really surprising that Uber Eats wouldn’t have something like this.
It sort of feels like uber eats don't even care about homophobic / transphobic / etc. report, to me.

In essence they are indirectly making it possible for people to get away with such destructive and hurtful comments, because there is no way to report them, so they think it is fine and they can get away with it, and indeed they can.

If someone knows how to report such things I'd really appreciate some help on that.
Fuck that person. They got their own shit inside their heart they need to deal with. You’re good sweetie, don’t let them get to you. Keep being your fab self and hold your head high.
Wow, fuck that person
Thank you! This is so nice.

I mean, I know it's definitely not everyone who would say what that person said to me, but god, this is honestly disgusting, and it shook me more than I'd have liked it to.

I'm glad for your response though, appreciate this a lot.
Does this help? https://help.uber.com/ubereats/restaurants/article/report-a-serious-incident-with-a-delivery-person?nodeId=c5688506-6c4a-499f-b891-7749919dd774

It seems to indicate there is an even more severe complaint chain, but aside from that maybe try complaining to their customer service directly.
I’m an UberEats driver and I’m so sorry that happened to you!  Here’s how you report the incident.

1.  Go into your UberEats app and select ‘account’ at the bottom of the screen.

2. Select ‘help’ and then select ‘help with an order’.

3.  You should see a list of your most recent orders.  Select the order with the problematic driver.

4.  Select ‘safety’.  Then select ‘Report a safety incident involving a delivery person’.  Report the incident in the ‘share details’ section.  The incident will be reviewed by a member of Uber’s safety team.

I hope this helps, OP, and I hope that MF-er gets banned from the platform.
Thank you. It helps every time I get some responses from this community. I'm glad I've found y'all.
You're welcome.  I genuinely enjoy making people smile 😊

Hugs 🤗🤗
Thank you! Yeah, I will try this. I hope they will see reason. This kind of behavior is entirely unacceptable.
Thank you! I hadn't seen the option in there, the help screen is kind of wiggly with a screen reader and keeps moving you on random buttons if you're not careful. I'll try that, and yes I hope they do get banned.
I agree & im sorry this happened to you, you didn't deserve it at all.
No problem!  Good luck 😊"	zf6rqq	NonBinary	108	0.98	2022-12-07 17:07:20
Arm workouts ease my dysphoria so much it’s unbelievable 💪		"I bet you give amazing hugs <3
Goals af. If you don't mind me asking, do you have a workout routine?
Same! I've just started getting actual biceps and even the tiny bit of euphoria i get from it is kind of overwhelming. Your arms are such goals!
I wish my arms looked that amazing!
It's cause they look great!!
It's cause they look great!!
Sick gains my friend!
That’s the best compliment I’ve ever received 😭
Kind of! I’m certainly no expert though lol. I work out at least 4 days a week on top of rock climbing. When I do work out, I have a few circuits I go through depending on what I want to work that day (arms, legs, etc). Or I just do cardio (ugh running) if I feel I need/want it. Every time I work out, I have a core/an workout I do. I never skip that and I always stretch a lot after. Otherwise I kind of just make it up as I go. The goal when I work out usually is to focus on one body part until it’s exhausted. It’s been good for me so far!
It feels so nice doesn’t it? I look in the mirror and I’m like “wow this really is me”. It feels so connective and helps to somewhat to distract from my chest dysphoria. Thank you! Keep up the good work!"	fdrud2	NonBinary	105	1.0	2020-03-05 07:36:33

Sometimes I'm too hard on myself. I know I'll be ok and look just fine. But dysphoria be a bitch Sometimes		"You look just as pretty in the first pic as you do in the second! Remember, you'd probably feel horrible if you had to criticize anyone else on this sub the way you criticize yourself. We live in a world where self-hatred and doubt is sold to us at every chance, and where it's seemingly impossible to find people who will accept us for who we are (even our families, in many cases), so the least we can do is be kind to ourselves. It's a conscious decision you need to make, to stop participating in your own abuse. You're too beautiful in the soul!❤️
Hair is hard. There is little we can do to control it, but people view it so critically when it comes to gender. The androgynous look is hard to pull off, and you don't owe it to anyone.
❤️❤️❤️ I know I have commented this on your other pics, but I think you have moved a lot toward the more fem look you are going for! I know it sucks that getting to exactly where we want to be takes time and work. In my eyes though you are getting there and you are cute. We are always so much harder on ourselves than we would be on other people. ❤️
You're sweet, thank you and you look amazing as well."	lphlzs	NonBinary	101	0.97	2021-02-22 07:00:53

Interesting experience with dysphoria yesterday…	"Hi! A little background first: I’m AFAB age 38 and only figured out last year that there are actually words (non-binary! agender!) to describe how I’ve felt since childhood. In April ‘22, I finally worked up the courage to find an LGBTQIA friendly hairstylist and got the queer haircut of my dreams (shaved short on the sides and kept longer on top, to be gloriously pomped or swept aside as the mood strikes). I’ve also been slowly purchasing more masc clothing or borrowing some of my cis husband’s unused clothes. I still have and occasionally wear clothes from before The Great Change, but I realize now how often I reach for my newer “queer” clothes. And I know that clothes don’t have a gender, but I didn’t realize how much my brain thinks they do, until yesterday…

I was sorting through the closet I share with my husband, starting to pull summer clothes out to make room for fall (we have a small closet in our bedroom and rely on other closets to keep winter coats/sweaters/etc). My stomach turned when I looked at some of my old clothes—and I dressed pretty tomboyish before—but even shirts that had a femme cut or (gag!) DARTS in the bust area just had to go. Dresses were suddenly out of the question—except the ones that I sewed myself: oddball funky vintage/punk ones. And it may just be sentimental value for those. 

I hauled a few of last year’s warmer shirts out of storage and was dismayed by most of them. But I washed them up—along with my current fave set of masc house clothes to make a full load of laundry. Went out and ran errands in a newer, more balanced towards femme outfit just to try it out. Felt ok—still felt “queer,” if that makes sense. The dysphoria hit when I came home and had to change into pre-Change house clothes because my fave ones were still in the dryer. Friends, my anxiety went through the roof. I even cried—and I could not figure out why I felt so upset (I struggle with anx/depression, so the feelings are not uncommon but this was a SURGE). Had to lay down and try to nap into a mental reset—didn’t work. Still deeply sad. 

And then I I emptied the dryer. Even holding my clothes perked me up. Changing into them was like stepping back into reality. I was fine for the rest of the night and this is just so wild to me.

Has anyone else experienced this?"	"Yes, last year. I gave away all my dresses, skirts, vaguely fem clothes and I did not turn back. It happened one afternoon, as I opened the wardrobe and I just could not bring myself to wear any of them. In a black bag, they went! Current style is casual sporty and old Mr Wilson from Dennis the Menace 🤣👌🏿
It’s interesting how much power stuff like that holds. How we can go so long ignorant of it but then after we figure things out a bit it becomes a need for survival. I went my whole life never considering binding my chest. I tried on a top a few months back that was comically tight in that area and it flattened me completely. I couldn’t stop looking in the mirror. That gave me the idea to purchase a binder and now… I have no idea how I lived so long without it. Anyways. Rant over. Sending you the best!
Oh yes a couple of different ways. A fully masc outfit makes me sick to my stomach and I've gotten rid of almost all my masc shirts. Then I found out when I wore my first dress that I had a similar reaction because it was too femme. So now I wear a mix either masc on bottom femme on top or femme bottom masc on top. It was weird to have dysphoria on both sides.
literally went on a dysphoric rampage through my closet and took my femme/dysphoria inducing clothes to a thrift place yesterday lmao
I wonder if it's a physical/mental reaction to feeling like you're being forced into a box again? I have a lot of negative associations and memories with my old clothes. Even trying them on or thinking of it being required makes my anxiety/panic rise. For me at least, I think it's a feeling of regression and being trapped. 

This feeling has infiltrated certain activities. I used to think i never wanted to get married. But if i can have short hair and wear a white tux instead? Then sign me up. So, that's what I'm doing.
I didn't notice experiencing much dysphoria until I realized I was enby. Now clothes are complicated - I've always dressed somewhat masc, but I have a lot of cute fem clothes that I just can't really wear very often anymore
[deleted]
VERY MUCH. my emotions around my ability to both self express and not feel dysphoric are so so tied to clothes more than like anything else since that’s what’s most in my control. if my reliable favorite items that make me feel the most comfortable and good looking are dirty i’ll start thinking about what i’m wearing far in advance so i don’t panic later, because i notoriously take forever to settle on an outfit (this is mostly temp issues tho 🫡)
I gave most of dresses and stuff away last year, and most of my colored clothing. I tried to get more color into my life, my friends said I should, but I realized I’m so uncomfortable with it and I don’t enjoy seeing myself in clothes that aren’t black. 
Just this Friday I went through my clothes again and threw away some more summer clothes that are more feminine, a couple of sundresses etc. I decided there’s no point in keeping them if I don’t use them and always default to my clothes that are more associated with masculinity. I’m actually a bit relieved, not only did I declutter, but it felt good to let go of stuff that bothered me.
Late bloomer here. I’ve had the exact same experience, especially since I cut my hair short. I’ve heard from folks that often you don’t recognize dysphoria until you’ve experience euphoria. 

Once I cut my hair short and started dressing more masc, I just avoided wearing dresses and femme stuff mostly because I loved how I felt in my new clothes. Then one day I was home alone and figured I’d try my dresses on and it felt terrible. I’ll periodically try again but every time the result has been the same.
I've had kinda the same experience, when I first found out I was non binary I still felt alright in fem clothes but one day I just didn't (I think when I first tried making my chest flatter) and have preferred masc/neutral styles ever since
Glad to know that you experienced it all of a sudden, too! And I love the description of your current style😂
So glad you discovered this for yourself! Once I got my haircut, I couldn’t stop looking in the mirror either! And I could finally remember what my face looked like, which sounds strange? I had a short but feminine pixie cut before and my brain just noped out of facial recognition for me. I’ve generally hated photos of myself until now.
I can imagine! I am happy you have found a working combo for you—it sounds amazing!
Must be the changing of the seasons—both geographically and metaphorically!
I think you’re right! Some of those clothes do have some negative memories attached. 
Also—YES to the white tux! The day I can finally make/tailor a suit to fit me, I will ascend into Final Boss Form❤️
Yes! I recognize those femme clothes as “cute” but cannot wear them. They’re cute but not for me anymore.
Thank you so much! I agree—clothing that accurately depicts who I am matters much more me now that I’m NB/agender. Best wishes to you as well❤️
Agreed! I do so much laundry currently to make sure I have MY clothes available. It does require lots of planning—especially since my teaching clothes (only a few hours of my week) are different than my regular work clothes.
Yes! Freeing up our precious closet space for clothes that actually make us feel like us:)
Yes! I really do think my haircut was the trigger that set all of this in motion. It was the first time I was truly pleased with my appearance!
Thank you for sharing! It’s wild to me that so many of us had “one day it was no longer ok” experience!
It floored me. I spent the previous years getting at ease with myself, my sleeve, and then figured out I was not into the binary. Agender queer, here 🙋🏿 I want comfort and long-lasting clothing, and the society we live in makes that affordable for so-called men's clothing. 

As I'm growing more at ease with my authentic self, I remember what I loved to wear as a child and that's what I go for now. Waistcoats, suspenders, button down shirts, tracksuit pants, fugly loafers, dungarees. 

I now live in a small coastal village, and I'm relishing turning into this old guy by the sea. I went foraging yesterday, okay. 🤣 

Unfortunately, everything frilly is associated with my mother forcing me into certain attires, no matter how much discomfort they cause my unaware autistic self. I no longer care whether I look ""stylish"" or am pleasing to another's eye. Defiant? Yes, yes, very much so. 

I do enjoy causing uncertainty with my appearance because it is nobody's business to put me in any box. 

I have kept some t-shirts because they're so bloody soft and comfy. ☺️
definitely, and I’m really looking forward to putting together the new gender wardrobe of my dreams! I’ve been slowly accumulating vintage masc sweaters for the cooler weather that I can’t wait to wear. wishing you all the queer clothes that make you happy and comfy, and let you step into reality every day when you put them on!!!
Same! I describe it to people as the first time I felt like I saw “me” in the mirror. Couldn’t stop taking selfies haha

Quickly realized talking to cis people that this was not cis behavior lol
Ofc! It's wild to me too lolzz
This sounds like a WONDERFUL life and I am overjoyed it is yours:) Funny how we knew ourselves better as kids, in some ways—I stole my dad’s clothes and wore them for quite awhile as a preteen. I now have the sewing skills to make or alter masc clothes to fit me and the possibilities are ENDLESS. I become giddy just thinking about it!
Oh yes, masc sweaters! This is my fall in a nutshell:)
Yesss! I am AFAB and came out as non binary two years ago. When I now see my childhood photos and the clothes I naturally gravitated towards versus what my mother forced on me - I can see the baby enby in me so clearly. I also see myself feel like a cute boy in frocks 🤣

But off late I also realise clothes themselves are so gendered as a social construct and I also gave all my dresses and gowns and things away bec they were high femme and I just couldn’t stand it. Off late I feel less repulsed and when I do wear a one off dress I still feel like a cute goy (that’s what me and my enby friends like to call ourselves) and I do not see myself as a “woman” irrespective of what I wear.
We truly do!! I would wear my dad's clothes as teen, too lol

I am glad you get to do this! Learning to sew is my long list of skills I want to acquire, but fishing and photography are next 😅
Good to know! I’ll hang on to the dresses I made just in case I become comfortable wearing them again in the future. With the exception of my wedding dress, they all feel queer (duh…they were made by an unknowing queer person!)My brain may just needs time to dissociate them from the time back when I thought I was a woman. Those weird prints and styles were my way of undermining the stereotypical feminine—my brain just needs to catch up to my recent changes!
Fun! Both are excellent skills! Hit me up if you ever want to try sewing—I have pattern recommendations and a whole slew of sewing elders who can troubleshoot anything👍
Yeah I think it’s ok for us to what feels right for the moment. And our relationship with certain clothes can change organically. I struggle with BPD and sometimes even the slightest trigger of someone not seeing me an enby can make me spiral so I feel you when you say ur anxiety and depression can sometimes toss you over. 
Also I’m so proud of US for coming out in our 30s, I’m 34 almost and I love that we aren’t going to the grave not fully embracing who we really are.
Thank you, that's so kind! 😊
Indeed! We ROCK! The thirties have been so much better my twenties—I’ve learned so much about myself and feel so much happier:)
And I get you on the BPD aspect—I was evaluated last year and my doctors gently told me that I exhibited several traits of BPD. Realizing I was agender/non-binary helped alleviate some of the smaller day-to-day struggles but heck yeah, the spiral is real when someone doesn’t recognize or respect my gender identity. My husband is struggling with my coming out and this friction often pushes me up to/over the edge of dysphoria. We love one another, have a kid together, and he is trying…it’s just coming slowly. He’s grown used to the haircut and most of the clothing changes."	xhg5gz	NonBinary	100	0.97	2022-09-18 13:04:27
Thought I was pulling a fast one, turns out I needed therapy	"CW: periods, dysphoria, surgery, and thoughts of self harm

So I'm laying here four days after my hysterectomy that I got my insurance to completely cover under gender affirming care (I'm in the USA so very excited my employer offers insurance that doesn't hate trans people) and I wanted to tell people who might get it about how I was tricked into self discovery.

I came out as nonbinary a while ago and started going back to therapy right after because I wanted to talk with a therapist who specializes in lgbtqia issues while I was dealing with only figuring out I wasn't cis at age 25. We talked about my newly discovered lack of gender, childhood trauma, and discovered my previously undiagnosed ADHD so it isn't surprising that we hadn't gotten around to discussing gender dysphoria around periods until I decided to get a hysterectomy.

The thing is, I've wanted a hysterectomy since I found out that was a procedure that exists. I have severe PCOS and never wanted children so after I had my first period at 12 I decided I wasn't doing this any longer than necessary and started looking up how to get rid of periods. I found out about the hysterectomy and knew I'd be getting one as soon as possible.

When I found out my insurance would cover them fully only if they were medically necessary or they were being done as gender affirming care for someone with severe dysphoria. 

At the time I didn't think I had any dysphoria about periods, but I decided after the whole Roe V Wade thing I wasn't waiting around and would get rid of my uterus by ant means necessary. So I decided to lie about dysphoria (even if I felt terrible doing it) to get my procedure covered. 

If you've had any gender affirming surgery you know you need at least one letter from a mental health professional backing up your need for the procedure. For my insurance to cover this one, I needed two letters from two different professionals. So I talked to my regular therapist and found a second one as well.

I was fully prepared to exaggerate and/or make up dysphoria while talking to these therapists so they would give me the letters I needed but as soon as they started asking questions it started to dawn on me that I actually do have severe dysphoria around periods.

My feelings about periods, like many other things in my life, I had convinced myself were the standard but were actually a sign I'd not known to look for pointing at my being nonbinary. I didn't realize that the extreme depression I got every month wasn't just a hormonal thing and that it wasn't normal to legitimately consider how I could remove my uterus myself every time I had a cramp or had to change my sanitary products. There were also the feelings of self hatred and other signs that I'd never known weren't just ""normal"" cis woman feelings about periods.

Yes, it's normal to hate your period and for hormones to trigger mental health issues, but I was actually considering removing my own uterus and didn't think there was anything unusual about that. 

So I rolled up to therapy thinking I was about to pull a fast one on the insurance company and left with my own shit rocked. Good news, I got the hysterectomy and was on T for the last year so I hadn't had to deal with a period for several months before the surgery and it's already so much better not having to deal with it.

I just wanted to share with other nonbinary folks who might understand not realizing something honestly kind of obvious about their gender until it reached out and slapped them in the face."	"Yeah - i figured out my nonbinary status because of breastcancer. 

The surgeoun kept pushing for reconstruction, so i said ok - then i had the worst nightmare about waking up from surgery with boobs...i woke up crying and ended up choosing to go flat.

No regrets, i look so good without boobs - now i love shopping for mens wear. And the hormone blockers made my period disappear which made me so happy.

Im cancerfree pt btw :) And i look like i always dreamed about when i was young :)
Happy for you, but I also want to say lying to access treatment you need is morally correct. Fuck insurance companies
So delighted for you mate!! Dysphoria can be so convoluted, I had a similar situation where I knew I had dysphoria about it but didn't realize just how bad it was. I'd pretty much forced myself to ignore it/not think about it because it was just so horrible to even think about 😅  I had my hysterectomy in august, hope you heal up fast and easy ❤️ Feel free to dm me if you have any healing questions!
I for the longest time thought loathing and being very weirded out by ones uterus was normal. The idea of giving birth gave me the heebie-jeebies, like made me have a full body reaction. Having to shake off the feeling gross weird fear. Even after I came out as Non binary I thought, 'yeah I do want to yeet my uterus but that doesn't make me trans enough. It's not as Important as other people's transitions.' I figured out a lot since then including what impostor syndrome is lol.

On 12/27/22 I got my brand spanking new OBGYN to agree to take out my uterus. I have to get a letter from my therapist which is mostly already written and ok from my insurance which is medicaid and then 🤞I get to yeet the terrorist. Yay us!🎉🎊🎉 And a Happy New Year!🎊🎉🎊
I went into therapy hoping to establish a paper trail to access surgery and discovered that I had much deeper issues than just my gender.
Ah yes, I had the same thing happen to me about top surgery. I used to wish I had a risk of breast cancer, and then thought about if I could just “lie” and say I was trans. Turns out it wasn’t a lie lol
I'm kicking myself that I didn't get a hysterectomy when I got my bilateral salpingectomy, but maybe it's not too late.

Your experience has me questioning if the sudden and consistent lack of energy, focus, and general mood during my periods is maybe something other than just the normal monthly bullshit.

I've been dysphoric about my boobs since puberty. Alternating with a sort of resigned acceptance in my 20s, until I came out as NB and realized I'd still rather yeet the teet.

I only found out I was NB this last year, and meeting other NBs, learning about gender and language, and hearing stories of other NBs at my organization's LGBTQ+ group all helped me finally put into words how I've felt since I was a kid.

Now the work to start becoming who I really am begins.
I don't really want people to cut on me so I still have all my organs intact (hope I never break something serious 😬)

But I completely understand your dysphoria around periods. I actually take a birth control that has a very nice side effect of stopping my period almost completely. I've been so much happier ever since I got on it about 4 years ago but it took almost a year to figure out it was because of dysphoria
Congratulations on your recovery!!! Wishing you the best thank you for sharing 💞
Thank you! I wasn't feeling bad about lying to insurance as much as I was feeling gross about lying about experiencing something I didn't that is so bad for people who actually have it. Even before I realized I do actually have dysphoria about my periods I had dysphoria about my boobs so I knew how bad it could be and it just felt gross lying about it.

That being said, I was going to do it anyway because you're right fuck insurance companies. And everyone who wants one should get a free hysterectomy no matter the reason in my opinion.
Pregnancy and giving birth is disgusting in general (a miracle but ew ×1000) but the idea of doing it myself makes me want to crawl in a hole and never come out. Even as a child I said if I ever decided kids weren't awful I'd just adopt because being pregnant creeps me out so much. 

Good luck with your insurance, I hope it all gets done quickly and as painlessly as possible!
I went in for gender and to get more help with the mental illnesses I knew I had and found out about my ADHD and trauma I didn't even know existed so yeah therapy will get ya like that
I'm glad I could help you start questioning it because it floored me that I'd never realized it but once I knew what was going on I felt so much better!

I always hated my boobs as well and listening to the first nonbinary person I'd met irl talk about their own dysphoria made me question if I was also nonbinary because it was exactly how I felt about my chest. It's wild how hearing about other people's experiences can make you realize things about yourself you never thought to question.
Thanks and freaking Same! Wishing you speedy recovery! 💛🤍💜🖤🎉
Totally!

It was a strange confluence that revealed to me I was enby. It started years ago, just meeting more and more non-binary folks. Then I joined my current company and they have a big 2SLGBTQ+ group and I learned more about gender.

Then I watched Owl House and saw Raine Whispers and so many things clicked into place.

Now, about half my friends are non-binary and last year I bought my first binder. :3

I totally echo your experience on hearing someone talk about chest dysphoria. A genderqueer friend of mine occasionally sends me vids of enbies who've gotten top surgery and we like to chat about what resonates with us.

Thank you for sharing your experience, and for the reply! 😁"	1016xx4	NonBinary	100	0.99	2023-01-02 07:52:36
My dysphoria is gone since my fiancée shaved my head.		"YES SIB! LOOKS AMAZING!

If it's not too personal a question, were you losing your hair beforehand? I was and shaving all mine off had exactly the same effect.
Looks great! I was just talking about doing this.
Looking fantastic!
No! I did it on a whim because every time I got my hair cut, my dysphoria disappeared. I’m sorry you were losing your hair.
Eh, I managed a decade with lovely long hair :)

WOW! Thanks for your compliment! I didnt expect that! 🌞Yeah, I’m mostly stressed about that. Especially people judging me for being nonbinary.
That’s the sad part for me. 🙁 I’m Just starting to get used to my looks in the mirror, but learning what other people see me as or what i see when they take pictures of me is disorienting. I’m trying to learn to love all my parts but ugh :(
I will try to think this more often.
ahhh thanks so much. My therapist has me doing the affirmations thing too, but i get in modes of depression where i just bypass everything around me. I think what ill try to do is take some time out to do look at those affirmations again. And remember it takes time. The deserving thing is hard too bc some trauma i had growing up, so i know that will take a bit to accept. Thank you.
Wow! Thanks!!! Happy is a new one! And fun! I never think of myself as those things, but reading that is making me think differently. I’m slowly, slooowwly learning.

Felt good about my face but chest dysphoria is rough.		"You look very androgynous!
I wish I could look as good as you in Ambiguous mode.
How do you deal with the chest dysphoria? I  struggling too 😞
Thank you! ♥️ means a lot.
It’s hard ... I wear tight sports bras bras. I have a binder coming today and hoping that offers relief too. I’m getting surgery early next year and I keep being hopeful and imagining my body without my chest ... it helps some ...
I don’t like that tight tight feeling but I wear sporty bras too. I hate the sensation of my chest and I struggle being in my body. I’m trying to get on the list for top surgery but I felt like my first appointment didn’t go that well. I’m trying to stay hopeful but it’s hard sometimes. I’m glad you have hope too."	cj290d	NonBinary	99	1.0	2019-07-28 22:13:45
Nonbinary erasure/gatekeeping is the biggest bullshit ever	"I found a post on another subreddit ranting about ""nbs invading queer spaces"" or something like that. The person states that pronouns are BS and such. I jokingly made a TERF comment and they denied it and stated they're okay with trans people, and then went on a rant about how there's no proof that nonbinary people exist and that you need dysphoria to be trans.

To hell with that! The reason I call myself nonbinary is because I'm both a guy and a girl! At least, that's what being nonbinary means for me. I experience minor dysphoria, but not enough to qualify as outright trans. That doesn't mean that because I'm not trans, that I must be cis, or else I wouldn't be on this sub! I've experimented with all ends of the gender spectrum and have not been able to pick just one end or the other. So, to say that nonbinary people don't exist is, indeed, gatekeeping.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk."	"If you're not cis, why are you not trans? Why do you need more dysphoria to be trans? What do you believe being trans is?

The gatekeeping we get from others royally sucks, but sometimes we gatekeep ourselves a lil bit as well.
I hate the idea that non-binary people are just confused or doing it for attention. I don’t feel like a guy or a girl, I feel non-binary. I don’t want to identify with the binary genders. They aren’t me. I’ve written to a newspaper before about it and the commentary on their Facebook over it was so disgusting.
Before nb was defined, I identified as third gender, because I knew I wasn't male or female. There just weren't well defined options back then. As language evolves, so too did labels regarding my identity. I have been nb for a while now, and recently embraced the Agender title. Being out for the last 20 yrs, gender is not necessarily a fixed point in time. It's not easy. But you have support. Keep going!
if i see another post about needing dysphoria to be trans or eyphoria or any variation beyond ""being trans is not being your agab"" i am going to lose my mind like a wild chimpanzee and kill someone
more seriously this is such a vulnerable community already and we dont need people to divide it further with shit like ""real trans people""
I mean, there's literally a sub called LGBQ that makes it very clear trans people are 'welcome' but can't post about their identity or experiences etc. They also state that trans people have 'taken over' all other subs. 

Unfortunately, there's always going to be people that are exclusionary. The best thing we can do is build each other up and surround ourselves with positive supports. The only way their opinions have power is if you let them. Empower yourself and know that ignorance doesn't make your identity any less valid. 

I know it's harder to do so than just saying it, trust I understand but it's a goal to work towards that helped me retain my sanity.
""I support trans people! Except the people that are not FtM or MtF because trans obviously can't be an umbrella term""
I saw a horrible rant the other day about a lesbian who wasn’t proud to be LGBT because pride isn’t for kids and also shoehorned some TERF crap in there about being “forced” to like dicks as a lesbian. And it had 4500 upvotes, it made me really sad.

Gatekeeping sucks. You are real. You are trans if you feel the label fits you. Don’t let TERFs and transmedicalists get you down.
It’s actually kinda terrifying. They are just like incels and “alt-right” neo-nazis, using the same language, arguments, and tactics.
Hell, i know how fucked up disphoria can feel. Today was such a day. I see myself as enby because I know that a transition wouldn't be right either but I'm 100% not cis. 

Can I ask which sub this was?
It's because I keep sliding up and down the gender scale. Some days I'm a butch lesbian and other days I'm a man with breasts, often a mix of both. Also, I wish I had facial hair and a male voice, but I like having breasts and I like having woman parts.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
r/rant.

Before today, I'd never seen a particularly bigoted or gatekeeping post on r/rant before, so I was really surprised. I think it might've been removed, 'cause I did report the post, and it was off the front page when I checked later on.

Edit: Yep, it was removed on the grounds of bigotry.
I mean, sounds pretty trans to me? Obviously trans is a label, and nobody has to identify with/use any label regardless of whether they have the ability to claim it. But the experience you're describing is very much a trans experience to have, so you ""qualify"" as outright trans as it were.
edit: [Found and image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/94595489c47c3d02e451c77ef30f68e6/tumblr_p8wfufIZXQ1ql3ud1o1_1280.png) that helped me out here, I was under the impression that 'trans' and 'non-binary' were distinct umbrellas. 

\---

Am I mistaken in that the 'trans' in transgendered generally refers to a transition away from a sex assigned at birth, usually to a defined polar end of the male/female binary? Is it now any transition away from assigned sex?

My impression has been that non-binary as a label explicitly communicates a position/experience/whatever that is neither male or female, with no attachment or desire to move closer to one gender or the other. I am new to all of this, but I feel like it's sort of like suggesting to someone who says that they identify as Vietnamese that they should just use the term 'Asian' instead - even if one technically falls under the umbrella of the other, it's a back-step in specificity.

(Please excuse any ignorance, I came to this sub looking for more input on the concept because there has been a lot of questions on my mind the last few years, and recent experiences have REALLY made me want to seek discussion on the subject)
The common definition of transgender doesn't require any transition at all. You just need to identify (and therefore are) a different gender then what you were assigned as. This would mean that most non-binary person is trans.
The ""Trans"" in transgender means ""across"", ""beyond"", ""through"", ""on the other side of"" and so on. ""Cis-"" means ""On this/the same side of"".

So you have cisgender, which means your gender is ""on the same side"" as your assigned gender. And you have transgender, which conveys the idea that your gender is not ""on the same side"" as your assigned gender, it is on another side, with cool additional ideas of your gender going across or through the social boundaries of gender.

It does not and has never had anything to do with transitioning. The fact that transition and transgender start with the same prefix is because the prefix is useful to both words (to trans-ition is to move across a boundary, to go to another side, you see). Transgender *and* transition draw from the root latin ""Trans-"". Transgender does not draw from transition.

> it's sort of like suggesting to someone who says that they identify as Vietnamese that they should just use the term 'Asian' instead - even if one technically falls under the umbrella of the other, it's a back-step in specificity.

I never suggested that someone use trans *instead of* non-binary. People are trans *as well as* non-binary. You can be as specific as you want with your identity.

For example I am a transgender, non-binary, fluidflux demiwoman."	eytzh3	NonBinary	99	0.98	2020-02-04 17:56:18

The other day I had gender euphoria when colouring my hair. Today dysphoria and this is how it ended. I hate my body and face image right now :(		"Dysphoria is a btch. But, the Buzzcut suits you! I have one too ^^
Aw, I'm sorry you're feeling that way :(

If it helps, you pull off both looks REALLY well. You have a lovely head shape and bone structure for a buzzcut. You could always grow it a \*little\* longer, bleach it and do some colors or designs on it, if that's your thing :3 I always think that looks cool af.
I genuinely think you look better with shorter hair.

But then I do love this kind of look, so I'm a little biased.

Hope you feel better soon 💜
For what it’s worth you look great but we are always our own harshest critics. I had a bad hair cut experience last weekend and cried.

But it’s helping me learn more about myself and I’m going to get some coloring soon. So I’m trying to focus on the positives and what I learned from it. 

But at the time it felt like my identify was partly destroyed I was really so shocked. Hang in there!
You look so cool, you’ve got a good head shape for a buzzcut and it’s suits you well. Hope the dysphoria goes away ✌️
Sorry you’re feeling that way Dysphoria is so tough! If it helps I think you look great and the shaved head suits you!
Have 100% shaved my head from dysphoria then hated it. Have also shaved my head from dysphoria and loved it. So, just know I *feel* you. 

Also, I think you look great! Not that the opinions of strangers on the internet matter. But just sayin.
If it helps at all, you have the perfect head shape for a buzzcut! Dysphoria is a bitch and can strike from so many things that we dont expect. Personally, i keep my hair in a short pixie cut since it fits any gender stereotype depending on how i style it. (Im genderfluid so being able to switch things around is important!) Maybe that could be an option for you if you also suffer from alternating dysphoria?
You have a really nice shaped head and face parts. 🥰

Wigs are always a thing if you want to change up your look.🌈🎉
Been there, done that…. Dyied my hair red, loved it, a week later „gaaaaaaahhhhhh get the clippers!“
just make like Nicholas Cage and steal someone else's face
Sure is. Thanks! Buzzcuts are hawt. :>
My scalp cannot handle bleach at all but luckely I am kinda blond so I am thinking I’ll grow it out a little and then colour it blue :3 
Thank you btw!❤️
Thank you🥺🥺 I get it. The shaved head always makes me tingle in weird places 😸
Yeah hair is such a vital part of our expression so totally get it!❤️
Haha atm they matters! Thx 🥹❤️
Yeah! My goal is to have a mullet again. 
Because then it’s kinda boyish in the front and long and femme in the back haha. I also can put it up in ways that fit my mood/gender. Being fluid is sometimes so annyoing tbh. Because some days I feel really confused about what I am 😭😅 
Thanks for your input! And compliment. It made my morning 🥹
thank you sm 🥺 I think wigs would be hell for me since I hate having stuff on my head for too long 😸
Hahaha! Did the clippers help??
Ahh fair enough. Blue would look great!
Sure. The red was gone and I felt really good. Maybe I’ll do it again in the summer just for funsies. I love the feeling of almost zero hair :D
Yeah when the wind blows over my head I feel like Aang the Last airbender 😂
Oh god YES! Sure, sex is good but did you ever have that feeling? Lol
Only down point is: you need protection from the sun. Like I wore a had almost all the time I was outside because I get a sunburn so easily D:
Oh wow! I just put sunscreen on my scalp 😂😅
Sunscreen in the hair? Nah thanks 😅

I've never experienced dysphoria but damn that looks scary
Yep! I love this technique. 
Thank you so much
Thank you so much for your kind words
It really has been. I've felt like I'm losing my mind

does anyone else feel like they wouldn’t be non-binary if they’re were born as the “opposite sex”	im an amab enby and I still trying to figure out if I’m a woman. I feel like if I was born as a woman I wouldn’t feel gender dysphoria. Maybe I’m wrong but I don’t feel any particular connection to masculinity and that’s why I feel that way. Just wondering if anyone feels the same	"I actually do feel pretty similar to this. I’m AMAB and I think a lot about my realest self would have been so much more acceptable if I were AFAB, and it’s not that I wouldn’t be Non-binary, but more that I would have had way less need to question my gender.
I'm an AFAB enby and I used to think when I was younger that being AMAB would have been sooooooo much better. Now that I'm older I know that isn't really for me even though I do tend to be more masculine in my clothing (button down shirts and ties every day) and mannerisms. 


While I do plan on having top surgery (been talking to my dr about it recently and we are trying to navigate my insurance to see if they will cover any of it) I have no desire to have bottom surgery. I have come to realize over the years that I am very much neither fully female nor male. It took me a LOOOOONG time to figure out what I really am though.


I'm almost 46 and it makes me SO happy to see so many young people figuring out who they are at such a young age and doing it so openly and having such great support systems online though. Now I sound like a rambling old dude! Sorry about that!
I generally find it difficult to accept my male physical form as all-encompassing in terms of my gender expression. I'm too hairy to be pretty. My shoulders too broad. Etc. And I do question all the what ifs, had I actually been afab... However, I'm realizing that a lot of those feeling stem from judging myself too hard or comparing myself to others.
I'm amab too, and everything you say here is exactly what I've been thinking about lately.

I've never felt any connection to masculinity, and I long wished I looked like a girl. Wished I had access to presenting in a whole range of different ways - hair, makeup, clothing - like girls/women can do without it being seen as deviating from social norms or whatever. A girl can wear a long skirt or a short skirt or pants or a dress; she can wear pigtails or ponytail, or braids or a bun; she can wear light cute natural makeup or heavy glamorous makeup; and if a guy wants to do anything like that, he has to deal with so much shame and judgement and criticism...

But on the other hand, I don't know if I really feel like I am a woman, or want to be(come) one, so much as I just want to look like a woman. So therefore, I don't know if I'm a transwoman...

I imagine that if I were afab, if I were born and raised as a girl, I might have gone crazy from all the sexism and misogyny and everything, and might have ended up enby anyway. But, who knows?

So, in short, you're not alone in thinking about these kinds of things, my friend.
I think that if I were AFAB I would STILL be nonbinary. I think hard about it, and I think I do not want breasts or a womb or periods or any of the (excuse me) bullshit that women have to deal with.
I'm an afab enby and tbh I'd still be non binary if I was amab, probably just dysphoric about different things. I considered the possibility of being a trans man and realised that I would still feel dysphoric if i was amab, just in different ways. I'm really aiming for some middle ground haha. 

I do see a lot of young transmascs questioning whether they're non binary or a trans man and asking themselves if they'd still be non binary if they were amab so you're definitely not alone in this
Absolutely. 

However, untangling whether that’s because I was meant to be a woman all along, or whether the vastly greater freedom of expression women have in our culture is something that would include me in a female body as it excludes me in a male body… I dunno. 

Yet, I’m not strongly compelled to attain/transform into a female body. I alternate between liking and merely accepting the body I’m in (not counting common wishes for physical self improvement gains and actions towards that). 

While I’m probably non binary overall, I have freedom of expression when alone, so that is more along the lines of crossdressing. If I was born in a female body in this culture, this wouldn’t even be considered crossdressing, and I would be free to do it anytime with minimal judgment and far less threat of violence. 

If I could press the magic button, I’d do it in a happy heartbeat, but my body hardware and software are too male to make any such switch, even as I’m hardly masculine. 

If I were born AFAB, I’d just be one manifestation of a woman; maybe a lesbian, predisposed to working physical jobs, but otherwise not hitting barriers much. As AMAB though, I feel pretty lost, maligned, and isolated in our culture. I appreciate internet subcultures like this, but haven’t found anything similar IRL.
I'm an afab nb person and I have this thought often. I ruminate a lot on what I would be like as a person if I was born a cis man.
I'm afab, and I think I'd still be non-binary if I were born amab because I feel like a combination of both feminine and masculine genders. I like being androgynous.

I'd probably have less dysphoria about certain things (like a flat chest) but more dysphoria about other things (like my genitals).
No not me, I don't think. My sibling is an Afab trans masc non binary and I think we're both trying to get to a similar place with different presentation because of our agab. For them long hair and boobs feel too girly. For me short hair and a flat chest feels too masc. I think if we had swapped birth genders we'd each experience the others dysphoria. 

If I was born Afab I might not have figured it out, but I would still have been non-binary.
This is my conundrum. I'm amab and I physically and socially can happily pass as ""stereotypically"" female except for a few traits... but those few traits are some of my favorite traits about myself. So I think I'm some form of genderqueer either way...
I'm afab and identify as a nonbinary trans guy. I am very much close to being a guy, but honestly I really like my genitalia, so part of me thinks maybe if I was a guy I would be nonbinary. Idk tho I just use both terms and to cis people I say I'm a trans guy and leave it at that
I don’t know, I think I might have still been nonbinary, or at least a bit of a tomboy.
I definitely would prefer not being hospitalised for freaking periods anymore, and then getting told that I'll just have to take hormones that make me suicidal or deal with bleeding out.

Other than that, nope, still nb. But probably a bit happier.

Also I would be SUCH a tall bitch, like holy shit would I be tall. I'm already 180cm tall, so if I were AMAB and went through male puberty, I wonder how much height I would have gained.
I would be non-binary either way, but so many things would have been better if I’d just been born afab.
On the opposite end, I've wondered often whether, if I were AMAB, I would have thought I was a trans woman. That thought is the main thing that's made me question whether I'm actually trans. I know as a kid I wanted to be a boy but ""at least as a girl I get to wear skirts."" As soon as another option was presented to me, I was like ""oh that's probably me."" But ultimately I think I'm glad to be AFAB because I view it as a shorter path to where I want to be. 

That's mostly because I'm tallish though. If I have a Napoleon complex at 5'8"", I can't imagine what I'd have done if I were 5'6"". I like my small hands and I like that if I end up going on T at this point, that won't change their size. I like not having to shave my face. I dislike having a face that gets me gendered fem regardless of how I cut my hair though. 

It's interesting anyway. I don't know if I'd want to go on HRT or not either way. I want the skincare benefits of estrogen and the musculoskeletal effects of T. I don't want the tits or the beard or the bottom growth. Or, to be specific, I wish I could just have a beard to take on and off. And I wish my voice could just be ambiguous. Without talking in a way that strains it. 

But I always figured AFAB people are allowed a lot more freedom in their gender expression by society at large during their childhoods so in that sense I'm lucky for it. I just wish I could be cis and nonbinary.
Same, but opposite for me. AFAB but don't think I'd be nonbinary if I was AMAB
I am born afab and i think i would also be nonbinary if i was amab 🤔 but who knows :)
BROOOOO I FEEL THE EXACT SAME BUT OPPOSITE I’M SO GLAD SOMEONE ELSE IS THE SAME WAY
I can't (and don't want to) tell you what you are. But I can tell you about me. I used to identify as enby, specifically gender fluid. It came after a lot of self reflection and getting the feeling that the way I was was wrong, and that something else might fit better. In the end, part of me still felt wrong. It took me a long time, but eventually I recognized that the part that still felt wrong... Was the male part. And so I had to consider what's left when you're sometimes male and sometimes female, except you don't ever want to be male. That's when I learned I was a binary trans woman.

Again, I'm not saying that's you. I'm just saying it happens, and maybe it's what you're feeling now as well.
I fell like I would still be NB as AFAB person but I would feel more comfortable in my body.
Honestly, I think I'd just be dysohoric about different stuff. The body I dream about isn't male or female, the way I present and wish others consistently saw me is neither, etc.
I am AMAB and, while my dysphoria is about finding my body too masculine, I don't think I'd ever fully resonate with a binary gender. I've always found them... limiting, unnecessary. If I were AFAB, perhaps I would call myself gender-nonconforming because there is somewhat less stigma around that label, but my actual feelings on gender wouldn't change much
Personally I think I would still be non binary and experience dysphoria, just in a different way. Like most of my dysphoria is only a thing because that aspect of myself is associated with my agab. So if my agab were something different, I would probably still experience dysphoria just with different things. 

I still think you are valid though. For some people being non binary is just accepting that the gender binary is stupid (even if they like some of the labels with the binary genders) and for others being non binary means that they are not apart of one binary gender. Honestly, it's up to you to decide if you want to use the enby label or not. 

Maybe think about it like this. If you were afab and you knew everything about non binary people that you know now, would you find the label intriguing? Would you rather be a women, or a non binary women? It's all about what labels you like, so if you are struggling then try some stuff out and maybe ask questions like these. 


Ps. I'm not sure if this is good advice but I hope it helps.
Mhm.
That's honestly a really good question. I think I would have dysphoria about male genitalia, especially after sitting on my balls one too many times, but I would not have the hormone-triggered dysphoria, or the chest dysphoria. I think I still probably would end up identifying as NB, but it probably would take longer to discover because I likely would be happier in my body.
Yep! I think I'm just not fully accepting myself as a transgirl, but I'm not sure. At the moment I'm settling on being a feminine presenting nonbinary person (or at least I'd like to present feminine.)
Most definitely relate to this!
There are some things I think would have been easier if I was afab, but, given genetics, I suspect I'd still have had a lot of reasons to experience dysphoria.
Gender is incredibly fluid. When thinking of if I’d been born a male I get the same feeling of dysphoria as I do with what I’ve currently got. Some enby people are fine with what they were born with some enby people aren’t. That’s why asking for pronouns are important because you might assume a “she” when it’s a person who feels euphoria presenting feminine afab or not.
low key I think about this a lot. Like, I keep having this thought, ""I wish I was a binary trans man"" that way I wouldn't be confused and unsure of what to do with body dysphoria. And then before I've thought ""well, maybe I'd be more okay with being nonbinary if I was AMAB"" and then I think ""well maybe I AM a trans guy (or like, a nb transguy) and NB can just be a transition step"" and then other times I'm like ""It's nice being pretty and being treated nice for looking like a girl and am I one fuck I don't know""
100% i would want to exist more then i do in an amab body, amab body just has NOTHING that i want, like even my height is kinda gendered due to it, my feet and everything is so ""long"" and i think if i was afab i probably would have way softer features, even if it was this body.. so yeah, i think i wouldn't experience dysphoria at all if i was afab

i just would be comfy with the whole anatomy, even not having top surgery, just binding and being happy- but being amab it gives me nothing, no joy, no nothing

so yeah,, if i was afab id be content in my body no doubt
I’m afab and I don’t think my gender would have been different if I were amab. Although I have dysphoria about certain parts of my body, I didn’t go through with hrt because I don’t want the majority of masculine attributes I would have received
have you ever thought of going on e? i feel the same way (but opposite cause afab) and taking hormones has helped me a LOT! i still identify as non-binary but i feel much connected to my body/less dysphoric. good luck sweetheart, you’ll figure it out! <3
Having these feelings was what led me to realise that I'm transfeminine. It may not be the case for everyone out there but after a point I just had to come to terms with the fact that a lot of my DPDR and body image issues were in fact gender dysphoria and I'm really glad that I was able to do that. I'm not a big fan of labels (if asked, I generally go with transfem enby), still enby I guess?¿ Anyway, it's nice to finally be transitioning to a body that I feel more myself in!
yea exactly
you're 46? i appreciate u,, you're so valid and its beautiful to 40+ year old enbys are out there <3
This could have been my answer with the only exception that I have only started to figure out I’m non binary. The rest is all so familiar, including the age. 😂
54. Always thought there was “something wrong with me” because I couldn’t really identify with my birth assigned sex. I kind of realized I was “neither” at a fairly young age, but I figured that I “must be wrong” because “that isn’t a thing”. Everyone told me a was “a girl” and then “a women” and it felt like a didn’t have the option to be anything else. Figured I “could fix myself” by the “fake it till you make it” plan. This never really worked. Discovered the term non-binary at 49 (yeah, sad it took my so long) and resonated with it immediately, I thought that maybe I *was* actually “male” but this didn’t really resonate for me and I was able to come to terms pretty quickly. It led to a beautiful journey down a very queer rabbit hole of discovery of many repressed queer feelings!
aww yea babe I get that my hairline is a big one for me, just know your beautiful and your femininity isn’t determined by your features. But trust me I know how hard I can be to deprogram the beauty standard and women’s ideals from your own perception of yourself.
that’s also how I’m feeling right. I love looking like a women. But I dont feel dysphoric about my genitals. So it can be really confusing. Thank you for your response ☺️
yeah same i don’t even know whether to call myself a trans guy or nonbinary because i mostly like my body but if i don’t medically transition then people will think of me as womanly despite the fact that the ONE thing i’m sure of about my gender is that it’s not woman
and id probably be non-binary if i was afab, like.. if i know in this body that this box is tiring, i bet i would if i was the reverse haha
I have thought about it but i don’t feel dysphoric about my genitals so really I wouldn’t want to have erectile dysfunction lol💀. That’s honestly the biggest turn off of it for me
Thank you! We are all valid no matter our age, much loved to my enby fam <3
 I didn't even know what non binary or agender was waaaaaay back in the 90s when I was trying to figure out what was different about me. I can't imagine the difference it would have made it I had! I am so glad you are figuring out who you are now, it is never too late for us to realize who we truly are!
Yes yes yes! I know exactly how you feel. I thought more than once growing up that I must be male because female just felt so wrong. Back in the early 90s I had no idea what non binary, agender or genderfluid even were. I was always told ""it's just a phase,you'll grow out of it"". Well, here we are all these years later and I haven't grown out of it! I just now know better who I am. It is so great to hear about others my age going through the same thing and finding a happy ending. No offence to young enbies, I love everybody in the fam!
Omg this is exactly what I'm going through right now,  it's so bizarre reading my thoughts in other people's posts


I'm  ND too,  so I've been wondering if masculinity has any real part of me,  or if it's really just another mask I've become somewhat comfortable with. I feel no real connection to masculinity. I long to be more feminine but feel no real dysphoria about my genitals or even facial hair, most of the time. it occasionally feels dysphoric but other times it's even euphoric to care for and yet even that doesn't really make me feel any connection to masculinity.  

Is it because I'm amab,  and masculinity pulls me away from androgyny while femininity would bring me closer? 

This shit is confusing
I think you can take some time to think. I started T as a transmasc nonbinary person and my pronouns were they/them. Changes happened fast and after 2 months I was like ""I love my voice I love my body hair"" and started saying they made me feel more like a boy, and I think that possibility lead me to come out to people as a trans guy. I am very feminine to but now people don't seem as a women so easily so I understand your thing. Part of me doesn't know if I would've even knew I was a boy if I didn't see the changes first and like them. I could've just been super buried in internalized transphobia. 

I think I felt like my body equalled my gender but thats not really true. I love my chest rn, and even though I may get surgery, andbeven though it's typically feminine it feels like a boy chest to me now and honestly that's really cool. I think any body is any body you want it to be. But take your time because every journey is different
Knowing from age 4, that something was different. 40 years of trying to fit in and never understanding, why it didn’t work and that there was an alternative. Going full speed now. 😁"	opvh8d	NonBinary	92	0.98	2021-07-23 05:10:23
Top surgery in less than two weeks, got a haircut to celebrate! Didn’t realize how much dysphoria my longer hair was giving me until it was gone!		"That haircut really suits you!
[deleted]
Hair cut day is my favorite day ever
Congrats on your surgery! Also I feel you on the haircut thing, I always feel more like me after cutting mine
Thank you!
Thanks! They were super cheap from Zenni and I love them!
What's Zenni if I may ask?
A website that sells glasses for super cheap!

I need to vent, I'm so sick of seeing periods, pregnancy, lactating etc being solely associated with women and knowing I can't say anything about AFAB non-binary people not appreciating it or I'll just be a stupid SJW	"So i think I might be experiencing actual gender dysphoria because at this point I have to brace myself seeing anywhere or anything mention things like periods or anything related to pregnancy because I know it will be full of words 'women', 'mothers', 'female' that just make me feel like shit and I have to go off it. I want to be mature and just deal with it, which for the most part I do just fine on the outside, I just focus on my work and forget about it. But I can't deny that it builds up over time and how it mentally makes me feel anymore.    


It's difficult knowing I'm just one person, and I can't magically influence people that there are plenty of people who don't identify as female and still menstruate, give birth, breastfeed etc. It's difficult knowing there are certain groups (I'm sure we all know who) who will accuse me of being a misogynist and sexist when I say this, or even just be myself.  


I was hoping to one day have a biological child of my own but I really don't know if I could deal with all of this constantly. I don't think I would ever take hormones, or get surgery, but I really don't think I feel comfortable identifying as a woman anymore. So if I say anything I'll likely be taken even less seriously. It's always other people causing me so much internal turmoil and most of them don't even intend to be malicious which makes it even more awkward to try and educate them on this because I feel like they think I'm villainising them. Which I'm not.."	"I feel this deeply!! And honestly it’s how I knew I was NB, and my gender has been a joy to play with since. I find anger at heteronormativity is often a gateway to being free from it. You’re not an SJW, you seem like a human pissed at how binary the world is and I’m right there with you. 

If you say you’re not a woman, you’re not a woman. And if you don’t identify with another gender, being agender (also known as gender free) is real and valid!! 

Rooting for you friend. Thanks for venting. You’re not alone in this.
This is why I live in a place where being an SJW is kind of a lulzy badge of honor and people make jokes about how they're actually social justice bards and stuff instead. Because yeah. The gendering around all of that is *absurd* and even here I have to routinely correct people that I'm my child's parent. If having a child is what you want, I really hope that eventually you're able to find folks to be around who'll recognize you as you are regardless of your choices.
So be an SJW. Like, that label is entirely made up and empty. What does it *mean* to be an SJW? It's something people call us to make us feel bad and wrong without really interacting with our argument in any meaningful way. 

Technically, those are called thought terminating cliches. It's a thing a person does to quickly and easily label something as ""bad"" or ""other"" without needing to actually analyze it and risk being convinced. The term was made up, they act like it's bad, and then they throw whoever they want into that bucket. Well, if I'm honest, I don't care about being in that bucket. It's made up, and only other close minded people care about the ""gotcha"" of calling me an SJW. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Also feel this. Glad to see People Who Menstruate becoming used more often though!
Like the only feminine thing I ever wanted was to have a kid, but that's not in the cards. So it's the pregnancy test commercials that like... fetishize womanhood and pregnancy... that make me feel really uncomfortable.  I no longer want kids, i'm at peace with it, but those commercials still suck.
I'm so sorry😔
I totally understand what you mean there. For me, I’ve kind of gotten to the point where… I know personally that being an “SJW” is a term used by people who don’t want to take responsibility for emotional pain they’ve caused. I know it’s fine to want to be involved in social issues, try to enact cultural change, stand up for yourself, etc, but. Just. It’s so tiring. And I know, logically, there’s nothing wrong with being incredibly socially active, and that if you’re in a marginalized group and stand up for yourself at all you’re likely to get called an SJW whether or not you even fit the description. But it’s so hard to go out there and actually talk to people when you just kNOW they’re gonna be rude about it, so you start thinking you’ll just be “strong” and deal with it, and then you get mad at yourself when you can’t stand these environments, because you’re just being “weak” or “nit-picky”. I don’t really have a solution (and I’m sure you’re not looking for someone on reddit to tell you how to live your life, anyway), but I do know how you feel, and you have to remember that it’s not rude to other people to assert yourself, your gender, and your discomfort at their lack of inclusion. People don’t get defensive over this because they are bad people, and they do not get defensive because you’re being too rude—they get defensive because you’re making them *feel* like they’re a bad person (because in our society we have this idea that if you do one wrong thing you’re a bigot), and so they attack and tel you *you’re* a bad person, instead. Or you end up deciding you’re being rude for even asking as that’s how society leads us all to feel. I can’t say having this mindset will fix anything, but it’s certainly helped me feel better when I remember to take the blame off of either myself or the person I’m “up against”, and remember it’s a societal issue I’m facing, and lil ol’ me doesn’t have to tackle an entire societal issue today.

tl;dr: don’t blame yourself for feeling upset, and don’t blame yourself for not being able to deal with this. Whenever you have to talk to someone in a situation where you feel either like you’re being an SJW (/neg), or that they will call you one, remember that it’s not your job to fix the underlying systemic issues that caused this problem, and you neither have to be an educator, nor a Good Little Enby, and there is no way you “should” be dealing with this.
I feel this. Like, coming out as non-binary almost felt more frustrating than if I'd just never come out. Because even though I work with a ""progressive"" organization, I still get deadnamed and misgendered by coworkers all the time. I mean I'm still glad I did and honestly my depression would have bested me if Ihadn't. It just sucks that the worst dysphoria I've had is post coming out. And I gotta remind myself that it's not my body that's the problem, it's other people's perceptions of my body that are the problem.
It's the other way around your and dumb
Tbh, same.
Hell, I completely agree. The fact that someone isn't at least aware of the thought that  any part of you at all may only exist for your pleasure alone because it's part of YOUR body and not their choice to make really angers them. 

Let them be angry, we can enjoy that part too.
Just wanted to say I totally relate, and also share this video link - Jamie is a trans man and this video is about inclusive language and why it's needed, and I thought it might feel validating for you right now if you're interested: https://youtu.be/WdA6EqbR7LE
I'm an AFAB NB who recently had a baby and let me tell you about the fights I get into on Facebook all because I say ""parenthood"" instead of ""motherhood."" It's exhausting but I love my little bean, so it's worth the drama to me.
Was… was this started because of that one charli xcx tweet?
I 100% feel this everyday. I work at a place literally called “The Women’s Hospital.” It’s where people in our area go to have babies, see their OBGYNs, get ultrasounds, get checked for breast cancer, etc. I’m in the closet at work. I see my OBGYN there, and I came out to her to ask if she would approve of me being on T, and she wouldn’t approve it (for actual minor medical reasons that make sense. I don’t think she was blatantly being transphobic, although I do think transphobia played a part in her decision). 

I’m so desperate to come out at work so I can show them that there are people who menstruate and see OBGYNs who aren’t women, except I’m 20, a disabled food service worker, and generally pass as a cis woman because of the obstacles put in front of me to get on T. My point would be a joke to these red state conservatives, and I would prove nothing. I might damage my relationships with those doctors and nurses and coworkers who are definitely not accepting but haven’t been given the chance to be transphobic to my face. Am I willing to deal with that, or is better to continue to be closeted, keep pretending to be a cis woman, and continue to watch as this entire facility touts “womanhood, motherhood” as the singular end of a binary they think exists?
