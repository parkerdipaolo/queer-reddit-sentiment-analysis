Exactly how I feel		"OKAY THIS IS HILARIOUS LMAO 

I'm so gonna send this to my bestie
I feel like my gender is only there when I'm thinking about it - Schrödinger's gender
my gender is r/antiwork
*Having a full-time gender shouldn’t be a prerequisite for food, shelter, and healthcare.*
I’m in this picture and I DO like it
New gender unlocked: communism
This is my agender spirit beast
Gender abolitionism at its best.
Gender schmender!

This seems very reminiscent of Egg\_irl

“Hello?” 
“Oh hey! This is female! I’m leaving you” 
*hangs phone up*
“Damn it…not again”
Ive been thinking a lot on dream jobs and how having  an ideal form of labor was always weird to me.

I'm not as critical of gender as I am labor so these thoughts dont translate well for me, but I like the idea of 'gender is not as necissary as many assume it is'
Love this 💖
No but this is so so perfect!
this is suuuch a good way to put it, lol. maybe this will help me get it through cis people’s heads in a fun and nice way, haha.
In Finnish, there’s no gender for third person. It’s the same no matter what the person—hän
Wow!
Same 👍
Happy cake day!

Happy Trans Day of Visibility! 💛🤍💜🖤	"The 31st of March - today - is international trans day of visibility, so I wanted to extend a very happy one to all my enby siblings ❤️❤️❤️ 

I'm marking the day by booking an appointment to try and get referred for HRT via my company's healthcare provider, so please keep fingers crossed because I've been waiting for a long time! 

How are you all celebrating (if at all)? 😁"	"Think i’m going to come out to my friends on social media… i have a post drafted just gotta work up the courage to hit send

update: i did it. was great success. validation machine go brrrrrr
We have a Queer and Trans Employee Resource Group at my organization, but we’re mostly focused on anti racist work. We sent an all staff email this morning to bring attention to the day but also to ask how folks moving forward are going to center queer liberation and disability justice alongside the anti racist work because you can’t have one without the others! I’m also anchoring in a TDOV march here in Nashville tomorrow, here’s hoping no one comes to mess with us 🤞
I just put an enby flag in my dicord pfp lol
Mac n cheese
I’m celebrating by appreciating I have an appointment about starting HRT in two weeks.
Celebrating by being extra goblinish today. 💛🤍💜🖤
Im currently on my way to my bf :3
Going to a day of visibility event on Sunday at my local courthouse. :) It will be my first official event I'm going to after coming out as enby.
I am celebrating by getting over my general life funk via ruining transphobic morons on my posts.
I came out full public. Only 5 ""friends"" lost with a post stating from here on, this is how I'm doing things and if they don't like it, quiet leaving is requested. Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out type of ultimatum.
I’m on vacation with my Partner. Maybe today could be a day to come out to some friends. (Partner already knows/very supportive)
I came out to my dad yesterday and i might be coming out to my mom today. It went really well yesterday so just working up the courage to hopefully repeat that :,)
Im celebrating by uh, uhhhhhhhh, watching a tv show? Idk
i’m playing w/ my dog w/ music in the bg. i also made cookies :D
Yay! Gonna dedicate my day to annoying my co-workers by telling them Trans people have always existed 😝
Thank you. Am trying to spread a bit of caring joy, but on the day British Athletics ban trans athletes it shows how much more allies are needed who give more fucks to the trans community than their ideological masters.
I am celebrating by posting Trans Day of Visibility pictures on my social media accounts and watching and listening to relevant stories about trans and nonbinary people on my local public television and radio stations.
This post just reminded me to go to my local rally, thank you!!
just celebrating by reminding myself that it’s my choice to do hrt and that my body is my own :) i struggle daily with feeling guilty for choosing to change my body but i have to keep reminding myself and know that there’s people who support me 🤞
i will make a fire in my backyard tonight. i need an excuse for arson because i enjoy it
Good luck
I was going to go to a demonstration today, but I'm sick and it's cold and rainy.
Im paying for a speeding ticket :( but then having a campfire
Omg my cousin sent me the message and then I subscribed to get alerts from this sub and saw this message and was like fuck yeah! Honestly, I had not thought about how to celebrate except to use Lensa to make AI non-binary looking pfps lol! I did journal and wrote on my pillowfort account tiny bit. This is really awesome though! I hope there is more good days like this in the future! I hope that your spoon goes well! Thank your making this post! 💛🤍💜🖤
I'm at a drag show at a gay pub! So fun!
Happy TDOV to you too! It’s my 1 year anniversary of starting T today, and I’m designing a tattoo to commemorate. Good luck with your appointment <3
Happy trans day of visibility my Enby siblings!
Holy shit, yall see me???? 



(The invisibility cloak doesn't work)
I Was Planning To Celebrate By Just Making A Silly Meme About It (As Alas I'm Not Out To Anyone IRL And I Can't Really Work Towards My Transition In Anyway), But I Wound Up Being Busy And Then Didn't Have The Time :<
forgot that was a holiday. gonna keep doin nothing special
I didn't realise it was trans day of visibility yesterday 😢
Amazing! The very best of luck to you, really hope it goes well and congratulations either way on making the choice to live as your authentic self. It's never the easy choice, but it's always the right one
Proud of you! Remember that you are totally valid regardless of whether you decide to come out today or not! :)
Sometimes it is just about the little things :)
I really wanted some yesterday but didn’t get any 🤔
Amazing news, super excited for you!!
That's wonderful! Super happy for you, and good luck for today!
That's the way to do it! We've always been here and we always will be
100%, if you don't have your own body you don't have anything, do whatever you need to feel comfortable and at home in your own skin
Fuck YES!
Thank you!! <3
That's great, you've already got the first bit of kindling!
Lovely stuff! Glad to have you on the sub, we're all better for having more of us here :) Hope you have a wonderful day!
Nice, have a grand time!
Fantastic! Hope to see that tat on the sub soon :) congratulations!
Thanks. I am sure they will take it well but I’m a very private person so it feels like a monumental task even though I want it known…
I will make mac n cheese for everyone.
Thank you!!! I am also excited.
UPDATE: I did it and she was totally fine with it and it's such a freeing feeling :))))))))
comments like this are why this community is so important to me 🙌 sending hope & the best vibes your way 🤙❤️
Yay!
AAAAAAH YES, congratulations!!! That's amazing, I'm thrilled for you!!

ACT IN SOLIDARITY. DON'T FORGET THE COMMON ENEMY.	"After Trump's recent speech, I feel the need to call for solidarity within the LGBT+ community. I'm cross-posting in hopes of reaching as many people as possible. 

If anyone in subs not related to trans issues and who read this aren't already advocates for trans rights, I'll start with two points. 1) Trans people have always been on the front lines of riots, protests, etc for gay rights. There was no drama about it until some recent discourse that makes some gay/ lesbian/bi people put off. Most trans people are not in the group you are so annoyed with. And even if they are, I hope you don't want them to be part of a conservative genocide of LGBT+ people. 2) Those who want to take down trans people almost always also want to take down gay people as well. This is just a foot in the door. Trump's references to a ""nuclear family"" already show the beginning of this segue. So even if you don't care so much about trans rights, please understand that all gay and bi people are next in line under a conservative regime. 

We need to stand strong together. The current threat to our rights is stronger than it has been for the last ~30 years. The alt-right is trying to take over, eradicate trans people, and take away all rights from gay people in general. They won't stop until sodomy laws come back, gay marriage is illegal, abortion is illegal, trans healthcare is illegal (at all ages), and even gender non-conformity is illegal. Anyone who doesn't conform to a 1950's stepford version of gender and relationships is at risk. 

This is a matter of freedom, autonomy, and basic human rights for the entire LGBT+ community. I urge is all to come together and vote for any and all candidates who support our right to exist without direct threat to our rights."	"LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK

&#x200B;

Remember kids, fascism might try to make you feel special, but it's just to have your help at putting others down. Once they're done, they will come for you and everyone else on the outer circles of their shitty empire.
Its not just LGBTQIA, but also Black, Indigenous and POC, as well as the poor, working class, that they're after, and have always been after. Not to forget the disableist nature of this as well. And the prison slavery. And the immigrants, and asylum seekers. The people of the Third World. I'm sure im missing someone and apologies for that.

But first and foremost, our movements have had solidarity problems from the start. Too long have specifically white people stood in isolated movements and not joined to dismantle them all, namely the fight against racism. white feminists, for example, believe that they only have to fight for the rights of women, and most of the time -- surprise, its rights for only white women they want. 


We need to stand together to defeat all systems of hierarchy and oppression. You cant defeat capitalism without dismantling the systems it depends on to exploit us.
We stand together, or we fall together, simple as that. We've seen over and over how fascism needs an enemy, and as soon as they finish one, they make the next group one, so even ignoring morality, it'd a tactically sound decision to fight with allies instead of hoping they leave you alone. Morally, we all owe each other to fight for the right for us all to exist. Vote. And then? Don't stop, get involved. Whether that be in a directly political way, such as going to or organizing protests, or an indirectly political way, such as through radical acts of kindness that help keep others going when the system fails us. Because the system as it sits fails us all, and needs to change. 

These archconservatives may have hate fueling their movement, but a negative force like that is very hard to build with. We can build something new that actually helps us, if we work together. As a quick aside, it may feel like the choice is between sliding backwards slowly, and throwing yourself backwards. I understand the lure of accelerationism, rip the band aid off, once the aftermath is over, make something better. But remember what that aftermath entails. How many brothers, sisters, siblings, would not make it through the aftermath? Every step we cede to them, is that much closer to that. If we have to slide back inch by inch, instead of stepping back, slide back. Because the alternative? We've seen the alternative. They close the circle, tighter and tighter, cutting out people little by little, until their is nobody left to help the next person.
Liberation for all of us, now
Is there a LGBTQIA+ sub for protests?
WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF BEING POWERLESS, WE'VE HEARD IT ALL AND NO WE'RE NOT IMPRESSED, WE ARE THE NIGHTMARE THAT YOU BROUGHT TO LIFE, SO DON'T TURN OFF THE LIGHTS, THERE'LL BE NO SLEEP TONIGHT

Went out to a lovely dinner with family last night and came home to some amazing news! I qualified for the state healthcare and they'll cover transition costs! I could barely sleep last night I was so excited and wanted to share. HAPPY NON-BINARY DAY!		"congratulations !!!
That’s huge, pal! I’m SO excited for you!!!
aahhhh! congratulations that's awesome!! 🎉
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats!! If you don't mind, where could one find out more about state healthcare and how to qualify?
Thank you!
Thank you I'm excited too!!
thank you!!!!
I know right! lol
I'm in California so I looked into it and I could apply for healthcare through a system called ""Covered California"". When I did that and they saw that I don't have much of an income they sent me to a second application for something called Medi-Cal which is our state-funded healthcare. I then had to upload some photos of ID's and birth certificates and a few days later they sent me a letter saying I qualified! 

&#x200B;

I'm sure if you google ""state-funded healthcare <your state>"" it should come up with something
Oh dang! I only live in Cali for university but not registered there. Will all the hassle of insurance and travel, and now this information, miiiight be worth it lol. Or wait till after college but that's a lot of patience
Check to see if your uni offers any services I'm going to community college and there's not much but I've heard that some colleges especially in CA have pretty trans friendly healthcare options."	cd43dt	NonBinary	152	1.0	2019-07-14 15:13:54

MY TOP SURGERY IS APPROVED!!!!!!!	"Hi all,

I've been posting about my journey pursuing top surgery on a few different subs (transurgery, genderqueer, and here: https://old.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/8hqb3c/update_insurance_decision_on_top_surgery/

I called the pre-certification line today as I hadn't heard anything and they usually make a decision pretty fast on whether or not they will approve something.  Low and behold, **they told me it was approved!!!!** They'll most likely call the surgery office next week asking for a date in which they will contact me and we'll proceed forward from there.

I am so happy as I didn't even know this would be a possibility. I want others to know that if you do your research, fully advocate for yourself and remain patient, good things will happen!

I also want to fully emphasize that for some individuals and their current situation, trans-related healthcare and/or procedures are not available or supported. I want you to know that you are not forgotten and that your identity is still valid regardless of how much you ""pass.""

To everyone else pursuing surgery, getting surgery or are already post-op, keep living your authentic life and sharing your experience. It's been too long since I've allowed my own authenticity to show!"	"So so excited for you! :)
WOO HOO!!! You did it! Congratulations, I hope your surgery goes smoothly.

Not out at work yet. Constantly being misgendered by coworkers and patients and I'm trying to not let it get to me. Any other enbies in healthcare out there?		"Oh my god your hair is so curly and cute!!! Sorry about people misgendering you, that’s really rough 💛
[This is what I do at work](https://imgur.com/gallery/7owu9eA)
I’m in health care too! I have a they/them pin on my badge but still get constantly misgendered anyway 😅
i work at a school and sometimes the kids get confused by my presentation
I work in health care too but I'm too scared to wear a pronoun pin to work. I haven't told anyone at work my gender or pronouns either.
Cool!!! I hate that the first comments you see below it are all hella transphobic 😩 I really like the idea of a pronoun pin though
I never thought of a pin! I might have to look into that. I think I can accept that my patients will probably always misgender me lol but it would be nice if my coworkers knew. How did you come out to them? I'm a floor nurse in a rural hospital"	ezy44f	NonBinary	69	0.98	2020-02-06 20:06:32
Misgendered... by my mother.	"I'm nonbinary (born AFAB, they/them pronouns). I came out and I I had to explain literally everything.

I always thought my mother was supportive, she always asked more about the community, to try and be a better ally. But today she blurted out, ""you ***ARE*** a woman"". I've previously explained the pain and dysphoria deadnaming and misgendering do. And she still said it.

It cut me like a knife, and I don't know what to do.

For some more context, she was talking about ""specifically in the eyes of healthcare"", but it just shows she lacks the knowledge that trans-healthcare is a thing, or fully understands that people ***who are not women***, may have a vagina or a uterus.

I feel like I should be mad at her.

But instead I'm just I'm so disgusted with myself, I've never been so fully reviled by myself before. I hate my own mind. I hate my body. I hate myself. I don't even want to keep breathing. I can't speak up or say anything, my mother is proud and won't admit she's done any wrongdoing, she's already gone back to acting like she hasn't said anything wrong, because in her eyes she hasn't.

That's it, I just needed to blow, thanks for reading.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for the support, everybody. I decided I need to have a long discussion with my mother, and how she phrased her words. I think she understood the impact her of words, and how it affected me. She said she still can't fully understand what I feel inside, and I don't expect her to be able to, but she apologized to me for what she said, and how she said it, as well as how it made me feel. Thanks again everybody, for the support. <3"	"Oh my god. I'm sorry you went through this. This is an unacceptable way to treat someone who's trans / non binary. I am going through my own tough time as well, my own family or rather whatever small contact I had left with them evaporated.

They didn't accept my coming out. They outright rejected it. I was told that I'm mentally sick, that non binary isn't a thing. That I should get a therapist to stop not conforming to my assigned gender at birth.

And yeah, it hurts like hell.

If you want to talk, my dm's are open.
This sounds like a really unpleasant situation, to say the least. I'm sorry you had to go through that. You are valid and your feelings are valid and even though it may not feel like it right now you matter; you mean something.
Is your mother your doctor, or your health insurance? If so, her opinion on your medical care and situation doesn't matter. Feel free to tell her so.
I’m sorry your mom’s a dick."	yuyagg	NonBinary	63	0.95	2022-11-14 12:44:54
Using compounded T cream for bottom growth	"Using T cream locally for bottom growth

CW: this whole thing is full of genitals 

Hey y’all,

Haven’t seen a ton posted on here about this so I thought I’d start a discussion thread. 

I’m using low dose topical T cream applied to my genitals daily with the goal of achieving some bottom growth without too many of the other effects of T.

I’m a 31 year old AFAB NB person. My big goals for medical transition are bottom growth and stopping my period. The reason for my application of T directly to my genitals is to hopefully keep my systemic T levels from getting high enough to cause permanent changes like voice drop and significant body and facial hair growth. I do not plan on being on T long term, and will likely discontinue T if my voice begins to significantly drop - I’m less concerned about facial and body hair. I’m not on enough T to stop my period, so I’m testing out different methods of hormonal birth control to accomplish that. 

Here’s what y’all really want to know:

1) is it working? What’s it like?

Yes. It’s working. I started T on December 18, 2019 (4 weeks ago) and I’ve noticed fairly significant changes with regard to bottom growth. When hard/engorged I’m probably at about 0.5 inches currently. 

For the first 2-2.5 weeks it was kinda overwhelming. I felt very sensitive and stimulation could become overwhelming very quickly. This isn’t to say things felt bad, just a difference degree of sensation and sensitivity which for me made me feel like I was lacking the stamina I previously had. Now the sensitivity is at a way more manageable level. 

Persistent arousal is/was a thing. It definitely has become more manageable over time, but I still get turned on a lot, by a lot. The sensation of arousal is different with more of a “popping a boner” feeling and increased blood flow/engorgement. 

Other bodily changes: a little stinkier and sweatier. A little bit of hormonal acne along chin/jawline. 


SEX TALK

Receiving oral sex feels totally different. I have always been a fan of getting blow jobs - for me oral sex that involves more sucking/suction - but now there’s more for folks to suck on. 

I’ve begun squirting regularly. Both during partner sex (mostly blow jobs) and solo (mostly using a satisfyer 11/10 would recommend). 

I still get sufficiently wet when aroused, but seems to have less staying power than it did pre-T.  Beyond that, no difficulties with penetrative sex. 


END SEX TALK


2) are you using testogel? What’s your dose?

No, it’s not testogel. My prescription is filled by a compounding pharmacy and they mix the testosterone in a cream that’s specifically for genital application. This is because testogel has alcohol in it and therefore can irritate the sensitive membranes in that area.  

According to my prescription, each dose is 2.5mg. I think this is of 1% concentration, but to be honest my script doesn’t say. I apply it once daily - usually before bed so it can hang out undisturbed for a while - directly to my external genitalia. 

3) where did you get this? Did you order it from that overseas pharmacy?

I am fortunate enough to have a trans competent doctor at my university’s campus health clinic. She wrote me a prescription for this cream specifically. A 3 month supply cost me $89, none of it covered by insurance. I have heard about people ordering DHT cream (different from Testosterone cream or gel) and applying it to their genitals for growth. However, DHT is hard to get and I have access to a good doc so I’m going the testosterone route. 

4) can I see pics?

Sure. Def down to share with other NBs. Message me. 

5) how did you think of this?!?!?

I was cruising around reddit trying to figure out if I could get permanent bottom growth while minimizing the other effects of T and ended up on a thread in an entirely different subreddit for cis women in the clitoral enlargement fetish scene. These women are trying to enlarge their clitorises. Some of these women are using DHT cream and some are using topical Testosterone applied directly to their clitorises. (You can search reddit and find these subreddits easily) DHT cream is not available in the United States and is difficult to get sent through customs unless you have a prescription.  I spoke with my healthcare provider, and though she had never heard of this before, she follows WPATH standards around informed consent and wrote me a prescription. She’s been very supportive and informed me of all the potential side effects of HRT. 

DISCLAIMER:

Every body is different. We cannot pick and choose which effects of T will happen when and to what extent. For example, prior to starting T my testosterone levels were already high, that is outside the normal range for AFAB ppl not undergoing HRT. This is likely from polycystic ovarian syndrome, but it could impact the way that the testosterone cream affects me and my results. There is no way of knowing right now. 

That said, there may be some validity to a low dose of T applied locally if a person’s goals are bottom growth and not much else, at least based on my experiences so far and the experiences of the aforementioned clitoral enlargement fetishists. Ultimately though, this is an experiment. I am aware that I may experience some changes with T that I am not shooting for and have accepted that as a potential side effect of my treatment. 

Post questions below and let me know if y’all want updates."	"i know this is late, but this is exactly what i want. im almost in tears hearing how its possible and worked for you, as i struggle with severe bottom dysphoria yet not much elsewhere. i will be talking to my doctor about this. thank you for posting this, even if i am 2 years late. you are a life saver, and helped give me hope for my own transition goals.
Where are you located? I'm in Canada and in the process of getting a gender affirming hysterectomy (but keeping ovaries because I'm not on T) to get rid of my period without going on T or hormonal birth controls. It obviously doesn't help with bottom growth, but is an option a lot of people don't know about
Thank you for posting this. I didn’t even know this was a possibility...
2 month update: 

The persistent arousal and hypersensitivity has more or less passed but the growth seems like it may have stalled out too. Seems like there has been some continued growth just very slow compared to the initial few weeks. 

No appreciable change in voice. A couple of stray chin hairs that were always there seem more noticeable, but that might be my imagination.

Definitely have more acne especially along the jaw/chin. It sucks. I have a 9 step nighttime skincare routine and worse acne than I’ve had since adolescence. 

POP birth control has chilled out my monthly some as super light but now there’s spotting so it feels longer. We’ll see if it’s better next cycle. If it doesn’t seem to be improving might consider another option.

SEX TALK
Still squirting a lot but not as often as after the first month of T. Still enjoying blowjobs and handjobs immensely. 

Lemme know if y’all have any questions!
Hi, I’m curious if you might have a more recent update. I was told this week by my doctor that t just goes into the bloodstream so topical application would not make any difference in bottom growth & I remembered reading this post. Would love to find out what your results have been/if you’re still using this method? Thank you for sharing.
Thank you so much for posting this. I am also NB and have bottom dysphoria. I recently discovered this was a possibility and have read around some of the subs you refer to.
In those subs for cis women, they talk about taking breaks in applying T to limit the other masculinisation effects. It sounds like 2 weeks applying followed by a 2 week break is what many do. Is this something you do?
What's it called?
Wow, I didn’t know this was even an option!! Thank you so much for sharing your findings with us!

Do you have any updates on your experiment? Are you continuing to apply testosterone cream, or have you stopped completely? Did you ever use T beyond the local application mentioned in this post?
Hello! Not sure if you're still responding to this thread, but I'd love a long term update. Hows the growth? I'm AFAB Genderfluid and bottom growth with minimal other changes is my goal as well. I don't mind other changes, but I'm only willing to do the gels in higher doses. 

Ideally I'm looking for as much growth as i can possibly get.
Hey! So I just picked up my first gel dose today!!! Excited to shower tomorrow, so I'm wondering, what exactly did you use to mix it into?
Same, I'm two years too late, but this is exactly the post I needed to see. I'm trans masc nonbinary and I absolutley need bottom growth and simple meta and top surgery later. Bottom growth is the priority right now.
I’m the same way!!! So many trans males have top dysphoria not bottom and it blows my mind! I have bottom dysphoria SO BAD. I’m starting to grow a decent amount but of course I want to reach my maximum potential. I’d really love to have this cream.
I’m in the US. I might consider a surgical option for stopping periods permanently in the future (well next few years before I finish grad school and lose my university health insurance).
Hi! Thanks for the questions. I have achieved a significant amount of growth and still have not experienced other forms of masculinization like voice drop or a significant increase in body hair. You can look on my profile to see pics of my growth. 

Using compounded cream locally and cycling I got up to around 15mg/day as my max dose. Then I stopped cycling and dropped to 10mg/day. About 4 months ago I switched from compounded t cream applied locally to low dose testosterone gel applied to my thigh. This is a lot cheaper ($15 for a 4 month supply) and I don’t think switching to this method has changed much for me. Maybe a little on the engorgement/boner/hardness scale but not a ton.  

Regardless of dosage, cream or gel, and whether it’s applied to the genitals or elsewhere on the body - yes your t levels will increase, it will enter the bloodstream and affect you systemically. What I’ve done is set a target range for my t levels on the lower-side and just below the “average adult cis male range” which seems to have produced the results I want and avoided the ones I don’t.
Thanks for asking! I haven’t done any breaks so far, but I’m also on a much much lower dose of T than the women in those threads. I’m on 2.5mg daily and most of the women I’ve seen are on doses of 12.5mg or 20.5mg a day. I’ve already achieved some growth even at this low dose, but I’m probably going to go up to 5mg or 7.5mg a day soon. If I start having more noticeable masculinizing effects, I’ll probably try doing breaks.
The cream? It’s just compounded t cream. Your doctor would write a prescription to get it made by a compounded pharmacy at whatever strength is prescribed. Since I was applying directly to my genitals, the testosterone was mixed into a vagina/vulva safe base
Still on t! I switched from local application with compounded t cream to using a conventional t gel applied on my thigh (generic fortesta, 10mg) to save on costs. I haven’t noticed a huge difference tbh. 

My t levels on 10mg have landed at about 300 ng/dL. The trans masculinizing target range is about 300ng/dL - 1000ng/dL so I’m at the lowest end of that threshold. 

I’m actually going in for my first T shot today (10 mg/weekly). I’ll probably post about it and any differences I notice once im on it for a bit.
Hey hey! I’m still experimenting! I switched to shots a few months back and have been getting some more changes (with lower t levels somehow?) but on gel I got up to 15mg daily without experiencing significant other sides besides bottom growth. I will say that going on shots has given me a bit of a growth spurt and stronger erections
Are you in the US? How did you get the gel? Good luck!
Thanks so much for the info! Is it testosterone propionate that you are applying? Why are you increasing your dose? Is a larger dose required for more growth? As there isn’t much about this process, I’m wondering if a low dose over a long period of time will have the same amount of growth as a higher dose in a shorter space of time. I guess, it’s more about trial and error, seeing what works for your body and taking the advice of your doctor.
I have my first appointment with a gender therapist next month and am hoping to go the same route as you (doctor prescribing a compound). Also very interested in a hysterectomy (I never did well on contraceptive hormones).
Thanks again for all the info. I’d be very interested in hearing more about your progress/updates.
I’m still riding the high that this is a thing! 😊

Why is American Healthcare so expensive! I was looking into Top surgery costs and this is what I got.		"I'm in the US and on employer insurance. I'm nonbinary and went aesthetically flat. After my insurance covered 90% my out of pocket was $1,300ish.
I think it might just be top surgery specifically as well.
I live in Australia and it's about 14000AUD here (so about 7kUSD roughly)
If it's insurance like mine, you basically hit whatever your max out-of-pocket for one individual is, for me, that's $8150 for the year (total, so other expenses during the year could fill part of that total). I have ""average"" insurance as far as I know.
It's about the same in Sweden if you go privately. Gender affirming care is covered through our free healthcare but only if you've got a diagnosis which takes roughly 4 years to get, therefore many go privately.
MAN I FUCKING LOVE CAPITALISM /s
To be fair when I was doing my research I found that the cost of my surgeon in the US ($10k) worked out the same as going privately in the UK (£7k). I guess it's just an expensive surgery which is why it sucks that so many people have paying out of pocket as their only option.
I toyed with the idea (albeit very early into my discovery) of an abdominal phalloplasty and immediately noped out the second I saw the costs.
Cost is the reason why I’ve just accepted I don’t get the tibby chop.
mine was $3,500 after insurance. not by any means cheap, but not $10,000. i went w dr. mosser in sf. $3,500 to spend the next 50+ years in this body is more than worth it to me.
[deleted]
Going private for the surgery in NZ costs about $25,000 - $30,000 NZD at the moment which translates to about $18,000 US at the top end. Just for comparison.
move to canada it’s covered here
Because you have to jump through a million hoops to get covered by insurance... And capitalism. Consider medical tourism.
I can feel ya. :( In Brazil, healthcare is free for all people, but this kind of surgery is rarely made by SUS (our public system of healthcare). Normally it costs around R$ 10.000 to R$ 20.000, which for USA people is much cheaper than $5.000 dollars, but, for us, it is the same amount of money that  an employee who receives a minimums wage will earn in 10-20 months, if they didn’t have to pay for food, transportation, bills and (usually) a house rent.
That's why I'm hoping to be able to go to Canada and get my Bottom Surgery there instead. (I'm pretty sure it's covered there, correct me if I'm wrong though)
This isn’t for all insurance in USA. Some insurance have trans care like mine and it’s covered better by insurance. Also people don’t realize that just because you have insurance it doesn’t mean youre covered for everything. It depends on the plan of coverage as well. the best option is to call the companies and ask which plan covers what surgery you want ( trans related or not) and see if they offer/have coverage for you.
at that point you might as well just travel and find another country where its cheaper
yeeeep mine was close to 8000 total, down payment was 1000, and that was four years ago at a pretty nice place. they didnt take insurance, could have gotten refunded up to 3k by the good insurance i had at the time but that didnt happen even with proper filing 🤪
Some things are easier to figure out, some are harder. For me it helped to start with Umbrella terms first. Then start researching the specifics bit by bit. Sometimes it will get you answers, sometimes it'll be better to bench it for another day, sometimes it won't get answers (or at least not the easy ones). It's important to know that it's ok to take your time or say no, before trying to fit in a box that you feel unwell in because (feel like) we don't fit. It's also ok to try a box and later find a better box. (Or one that fits better now).
cause america hates civilians
i was planning but mmm... 😳
Mine was about $500 with insurance, but I had already hit my deductible by the time I had my surgery
Same for me, my company insurance covered my surgery. I just had to pay the remainder of my max out-of-pocket for the year. Worked out to about 2,600 for me. I looked at the claim and the total was around 14,000 o.o
Your flair is amazing
Is Australian Healthcare worse? I've always heard it was, but never knew if it was actually true, or just my grandmother's politics about economy.
I think that's because top surgery isn't covered by Medicare most of the time, so you're paying market value, particularly as you're probably going through the private system. So the same problems the US has that create cost barriers.
If you want one in Canada make sure you're in a place with any trans healthcare at all first. Where I live there is a dead zone of trans healthcare, there are almost no trans friendly doctors and there are wait lists for all of them. I was told the waitlist for a nearby trans friendly obgyn was 1.5 YEARS. I've been on a waitlist with a doctor that will HOPEFULLY submit my top surgery funding application for 5 months now. And then I have to wait for that to be approved before getting a surgery date. And then I have to travel out of province to see the surgeon I want and those expenses are still in the way.
It’ll only be covered for you if you have Canadian healthcare. So if you’re a US citizen, you won’t be able to just travel to Canada for a surgery and have it covered by their healthcare.
Yeah, that's politics. US healthcare is worse than most of the first world unless you're wealthy.
We have universal healthcare (somewhat rough at the moment because the Tories funking suck as always) but generally gender affirming surgery isn't covered. There is a growing movement to have it covered by Medicare but I doubt it will happen any time soon unfortunately.

I DID A THING	"After a long long time of consideration... Today I finally did it! I went to the GP and got a referral to the hospital specialising in transgender related healthcare! 

Now the real wait started, because last time I heard you have to wait a year and a half before they can help you. But I can use that time to figure out what I want exactly. As AFAB I get really the most dysphoria during monthly issues and genetics gave me a firm pair of F cup breasts. So that's something I know I want to change. But other than that there are still so many questions: full top surgery or reduction only? T or no T? What pronouns (currently she/they)? 

But let's wait with the questions for today and celebrate that I made the first step!"	"congrats!

Apparently it was inspection day at the clinic!	"It’s long and ranty so there’s a TL;DR at the bottom. 

I’ve been in and out of urgent care for worker’s comp due to a concussion I got at work, and ooooh boy it’s making me hate healthcare a little. 

The first visit was fairly normal, if you count my concussed ass floating through the whole thing in a haze. Still noticed the staff all calling me “he” (She/they are mine, and I was presented quite explicitly feminine) when they thought I couldn’t hear them. When I got my discharge paperwork I had been misgendered on that as well, and I actually went back to mention it to the staff. (I spent a lot of money to change my name and have my records updated, damn it!)

Today, which is the second time I’ve been, I got a different RN than before. This RN asked me specifically if I was pre- or post-op, since I had specified I was on medications for that purpose when asked. 

Y’all, I asked if that was necessary and the RN essentially refused to continue with the paperwork until I answered the question. He kept trying to tell me this and that about how it was just for the office and that he wasn’t trying to make me uncomfortable… fuck off. Even the doctor didn’t really understand why he had asked that. 

For a concussion! I hit my head, not my groin! 

I’ve sent the hospital responsible for the urgent care center I went to a detailed, polite but firm email. Maybe it’s petty but if they don’t at least pretend they’re going to talk to their staff I’m going to drag them through the mud on google. That was unacceptable.

Tl;dr: hit my head at work an RN asked if I’d had “the surgery” despite that being utterly irrelevant to my concussion."	"Unacceptable and downright disgusting; drag them.
Not petty at all, that's stupid unless the nurse could explain how that information was relevant to your care at that point then why ask?!?! will you update us with what they come back with? (if anything).
From the back of a moving vehicle.
Will do. Probably gonna be a couple days before I see a response, if any.
Absolutely no problem, just love closure on situations. I'm sorry you experienced all this by the way 💜."	rkgke8	NonBinary	23	1.0	2021-12-20 06:23:20
Legal Name Change & Dead Naming	"Has anyone here (in the US, specifically) legally changed their name (first, middle, last)? 

I want to in 2022 and am nervous but excited! It will be gender-neutral and it's a big step in affirming who I have always been.💛💜🖤😊

So, what was your experience? Any tips or advice? Anything you wish you'd known before doing it?

Also, how do you deal with people dead-naming you on purpose? (I anticipate it, unfortunately).😑

*EDIT: I should clarify I know my state's process but I'm more curious about the process/chore of changing documents, healthcare stuff, accounts, etc."	"I only have experience changing my last name in Washington state. I didn't change it after I got divorced, and decided a few years later I wanted my maiden name back. I called the courthouse, was told the price, walked in with cash (to get an earlier time, it was pay in cash. Cards were a week or two out), they gave me forms to fill out, and I had my appointment set for three days later.

There were about two dozen people there with me. The judge called us up one at a time, confirmed our names, asked why we wanted to change it, and approved us. Not a single person was rejected before me (about half way through). All I had to say was ""I didn't do it when I got divorced."" And they were like, ""fair enough. We get a lot of those here.""

The one I remember most clearly was a woman who was changing her name from something like Robert to Maria. She said it was because she was getting harassed from family and friends and needed to get away. That one made me feel sad for them.

But there was no big fuss over it, no additional details needed by the judge, no further validation of *why* for anyone other than the most basic, one-sentence reason. Something as simple as ""I don't like my given name and would rather be known as \[name\]"" would probably be enough. You shouldn't even have to explain that you are non-binary, if you don't want to.

Overall, it was hassle-free and straightforward. I can't guarantee what other states will be like, but I'd suspect it would be a fairly similar process. Just start with calling up the courthouse where they do name changes, and follow the steps they give you.
Congrats! I remember it being exciting and also a bit nerve wracking. It’s worth noting that each state is different on the process. So I guess my main advice is make sure you research it for your state specifically. You may have to save up for the fee, wait a certain amount of time, have the form posted publicly, or maybe even go before the judge yourself.

In Oregon, it was pretty simple. I went to the court house and filed a form and paid a fee. Then I went home to wait for a judge to review it and mail it to me. I was worried the people handling my form would be transphobic but everything went smoothly.

When I changed my name socially, I was working as a preschool teacher at a childcare center. I had to tell the preschoolers I was teaching, their families, and the staff at the center. I was met with a lot of positive support right away. But there were a handful of folks that “forgot” a lot. It was annoying but thankfully the kids and some other staff were helpful in reminding them. Having people on your side to support you is so important.

Wishing you tons of luck on this step of your journey!!
It's really easy. You simply have a hearing in a court and the judge will grant the name change. I don't even think I was asked for a reason. This was back in the late 90s.

I changed my middle name from John to Renee several years ago and I go by Renee now.
As I understand in the USA (I'm Canadian) it varies from state to state, so that info may be necessary.
Changed first and middle, but not last. Keep in mind that there's a lot you'll have to change after making the legal change (driver license, social security card, names on student or other loans possibly, bank account, names on insurance and health records, and more I'm sure). I've changed my name on so much more stuff than I was expecting. Here in NY I spent a grand total of around $300 to get my name changed when it was all said and done ($210 to file the paperwork, $40 to publish it in the newspaper although that may not be required in some states -- it isn't in my state anymore but this came into effect after my name change, and $30 to get a license with my new name on it). It was annoying but I'm glad I did it because it's really great to not have to say, ""actually my name is this"" when your old name is printed off somewhere and someone automatically refers to you with it. It's a really really big relief honestly.
This is a great approach to take in all things. Give a limited amount of details. Enough to answer the question but no more. If they need more, they’ll ask for it. If you’re not comfortable giving the increased amount of information they’re asking for, you can politely ask what the information is necessary for.
May I ask how it was changing documents? Like birth cert., healthcare stuff, and degrees?
How was it changing documents, accounts, etc? I'm worried I'll be locked out of things if something's like ""oh your name is different- flagged!"" I know with internet it's faster to change things but it's all new to me.
I know the legal route for my state but I'm more curious about changing documents, accounts, and such. That stuff is more of a chore.
Changing my name with insurance was the biggest pain in the ass. I'm on my dad's plan still because it's really great and I'm not 26 yet. He had to get pictures of my license and SS card with my new name on them and give them to his job's HR for them to process. There was some confusion and it ended up taking awhile. Nothing else was too annoying from what I remember.
For sure! That was a tedious and annoying process. I tried to do everything in one day once I got my official changed name document. I don’t recommend that. Get a new state ID/permit/license first. Bring your legal name change document to the DMV along with all your other typical documents, even though they have your dead name. In mine and my partners experience, the people at the DMV don’t seem to give a f*ck. They might deadname you until they realize what’s happening. You can be upfront about it or just bear it.

Once your official ID comes to you I recommend going to the bank and the social security office right away. Bring your new ID, legal name change document, and all the other old documents with your dead name. Again, people seem to get it or just really don’t care. You should be able to just state you legally changed your name and they’ll do up the paperwork.

From there you can call the companies you pay bills to. It’s mostly just time consuming and annoying to figure out the process for each company. For my electric company I could just change it easily online. For PayPal it was a long process of sending in my documents and waiting for approval. My cell phone company has only changed it over halfway somehow. I still see my dead name in some places. But overall no one really stood in my way or made me uncomfortable. 

I haven’t changed my birth certificate yet. That’s another one that depends on your birth state. For me it’s not too hard but just hard enough I haven’t bothered. So if I ever have to show my birth certificate I make sure I have my legal name change document with it to clarify the situation. This is a very rare circumstance. My partner is like me and hasn’t changed his birth certificate. But he lost his ID recently so when he went to the DMV he made sure to bring the extra document. 

I can’t give you much passport advice as I’ve never had one. My partner tried to get one many many years ago and they asked him to provide a ton of extra proof of his identity since he had mismatched documents. I think the process is better now. But I’d recommend getting your birth certificate updated before trying for a passport update.
That was actually easy. I simply showed places the court order. I only needed that for a few places and changing my license was also easy. I think I had everything changed over in a week. SS card was also easy and was a quick visit to a local office.
Oh! I never bothered to change my high school and  college degrees either because no one has every once looked at it! If you suspect people will need to look at them I think the process should be easy enough by calling up the institution. If you went to a conservative high school it might be uncomfortable.

My insurance/medical providers were chill about it too. At the time I had work place insurance so I asked the business manager to help me get the paperwork for it and had it mailed in. And when I went to the doctor I made sure to confirm my new name and that it was changed in the local system. 

Overall, name changes are a pretty normal thing even if you’re not trans. Most people don’t care or if they do you’ll probably never see them again. Hopefully. It’s also worth noting I live in a pretty liberal area. So people are often happy to show off their allyship."	rsxv5j	NonBinary	21	0.97	2021-12-31 16:43:53
Some personal thoughts on what TDV means to me	"Hey friends and siblings! Today's the Trans Day of Visibility. I'll say up front that, while I do choose to include trans in my labels, not all non-binary people do and that's totally valid. You're still awesome and celebrated today!

For me, TDV is about firsts When I was growing up, I was in a very sheltered environment. I didn't have any trans or GNC people in my life, or representation in the media (at least that I had access to). I was in college before I first found out that some people are transgender, and explored whether that label fit me. Even more years after that, I first found the non-binary label, and then [genderfluid](https://www.egscomics.com/comic/2014-07-01). I wish that someone had been visible, so I could see that I wasn't alone.

Even after connecting with those labels, there was still minimal media representation that I could find outside of porn, and I had no one in my life who identified with a gender other than their presumed gender from birth. Becoming visible to my friends, colleagues and family by coming out would not have been safe for me. I would have lost access to education funding, employment, housing and healthcare. When someone would make transphobic or nb-phobic comments, I wanted to be the one who set the record straight, but being visible was too great a risk for me. So I looked around for someone who was already out that I could involve somehow.

I came out for the first time to a friend of mine when I was 35, and it was super scary. I showed her things like the comic above, and tried to explain my confused and evolving understanding of my gender. She was very supportive, and we got me some clothing options to express myself in a way that was comfortable to me, which... sat in the closet for me to stare at every day for months.

I remember the first time I presented in a way that wasn't in conformance to society's expectations based on my AGAB. My hands were shaking. I ended up having a panic attack. Even though no one was there to see me, it was a first. It was another 4 years before I first presented GNC in front of someone else, and I had to ask them to zip up my jacket for me because my hands were shaking so much.

I remember the first time I came out to my partner. The first time I came out to a family member. The first time I spoke with my doctor about hormones. The first time I was GNC in public. The first time I lost a friendship over being true to who I am.

Today is my first time on facebook explicitly stating I'm trans. I posted it in the context of a fundraiser for the Human Rights Campaign (they're amazing, go donate). I'm in a position in my life where I can finally be **visible**. I can be that visible trans person for my friends to bring their questions to. I can be that visible trans person in my job that gets asked what gender options should be included on forms. I can be the visible trans person for others who are growing up in a world with very little trans visibility, to let them know they're not alone.

I'm transgender, and non-binary, and genderfluid. My existence and identity are not a political statement, nor are they open for debate. I am visible, and I stand up for those who face discrimination and violence, who haven't found or can't use their own voices.

Anyway, sorry for rambling. Happy Visibility Day :)"	"That was wholesome and heartwarming❤️

Advice: changing the language/narrative of abortion being only a “women’s” issue	I’m planning on going out to protest the Texas abortion ban crap but as a nonbinary person I’m struggling with how this issue of abortion gets framed in only a binary gendered way. Plenty of people who do not identify as a woman have uteruses or would be oppressed by this ban. I think this community gets this. The ban is a blatant humans rights abuse, an attempt to control a large portion of the population and stripping vital healthcare away. It’s wrong on so many levels it’s too much to list. How can I help people see that’s it’s more than a woman’s issue? How can I make inclusive signs that are short and get the point across? How can the nonbinary community stand in solidarity and resist?	"""Reproductive rights!"" ""My body, my choice"" etc. 

Here's the deal tho, I don't think a protest is an appropriate place to have a conversation about de-gendering issues like this especially when they are explicitly tied with misogyny. This wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't a majority ""women's issue"" and if you go into a space full of indignant, angry women and attempt to change the conversation away from why they are all there over semantics, I don't see it going well for you.  It may not be a ""women's issue"" in that *everyone* affected is a woman, but it is a ""woman's issue"" in that it is designed to control women because these people who make these laws are not doing so while considering the existence of trans people. They aren't doing this to oppress people with uteruses, they are doing this to oppress women, specifically. While I understand and empathize with you, I don't feel like a protest is the correct place for a conversation.

I wouldn't go farther than using ungendered language in your own sign.
I caught part of an interview with the head of a clinic in Texas last night, and she consistently referred to patients as ""pregnant folks."" It was a bit of goodness in the bad news.
I think the best thing we can do is just show up. Be there and be vocal, and also be openly enby. Use the flag colors and that kind of thing. I think that will help get the point across."	pghy60	NonBinary	16	0.87	2021-09-02 13:31:29
Y'all, I'm pregnant	"(this is good news and I'm happy about it btw.)

So yeah, baby #3 on the way, except this time I've fully come to understand my gender identity. I mean, the first two pregnancies were difficult but I could never pinpoint what was wrong. But anyway, at least I get a baby out of it, which is pretty cool so I can handle the dysphoria for a few months.

Idk if I'm ready to talk about pronouns and stuff with doctors/nurses/staff, or talk about my preferred name, or any of that. And I've worked in healthcare, and that has not left me with a great impression of what healthcare staff are like behind closed doors.

Anyone else dealt with dysphoria during pregnancy (and after, in regards to feeding). Any advice would be more than welcome."	Congratulations! I hope you have a healthy pregnancy ☺️	hrid7h	NonBinary	17	0.96	2020-07-15 06:15:56

breast reduction surgery??	"hi i want to get rid of my breasts, and i’m currently researching the best way to do this. 
trans healthcare in ireland is basically non-existent, and  to get top surgery (in this country anyway) i would need a letter from a doctor validating my gender dysphoria etc etc. 
i’m wondering if breast reduction surgery could give me a similar result? 
i’m a 32DD 🙃 
i’d really appreciate any help or advice. i’m only recently coming to terms with this and i honestly have no idea how to go about it."	"You could do a breast reduction, but it won’t be covered by your insurance unless medical necessity is proven. It isn’t the same thing as a total mastectomy, but you could go down to probably an A or B.
Trying to go through the same thing! In Australia it’s the opposite: breast reduction is covered as a medical surgery but top surgery is cosmetic, and isn’t covered. Still as a DD-E that’ll at least get me flat when binding, which I’m happy with for now
I have a friend who did this and came back a couple of years later to finish the job. It helped them (they had a large chest to start with too) but I think it only got reduced to about a C so wasn’t enough. The effort/energy to get the doctor’s letter might be worth it.
thank you so much for your response! yeah, im trying to weigh up the benefits of going through the public system and waiting years and years for top surgery, or saving up and getting breast reduction privately..it’s tough to wait. but i think i wouldn’t be happy even with an A cup ://
i’m pretty desperate to be flat ahaha especially since summer is here and beaches are a bit of a nightmare 🙃🙃

About a month ago a doctor with the name u/SirReality I asked our community advice about a new non-binary patient come in. Wanted to know if there was anything that the doctors office should especially emphasize or avoid. ? Maybe look them up?
So I'm a NB doctor but honestly still in the same boat as you. I find it pretty difficult to bring up pronouns naturally, especially when you meet so many new people every day. I was thinking about getting a name badge with my pronouns on (they/them). Saves the awkward conversation at least. 

But it's a big decision. In the UK, most medical schools have no training on trans issues and the NHS is fundamentally still quite conservative. I'm worried that being openly trans will effect the way people treat me or will lead to a lot of insensitive comments 

This response was probably of zero help, but hopefully knowing you're not going to be the only NB doctor out there will be nice to know at least!
Hi, I'm a cis male ally who's a doctor. Med school curricula and culture nowadays is very inclusive and I don't think you'd have any problem getting support from the school itself about gender identity and pronouns. Most (good) doctors pride themselves as being advocates for gender and sexual minorities, which include NB.  

Ultimately I would say just take the time you want to figure things out.  If you've discovered you're NB before applications, it's reasonable to be upfront about that - it could very likely be a positive on your application. And those schools (which I'm sadly sure there are a few) that would let that negatively affect your chances, you probably don't want to be at anyway.  I will say even the bog standard med student intro takes too long (hi, I'm student doctor so and so, yes I'm in training, yes you still get to see your regular doctor too) and I would be annoyed at having to explain my pronouns verbally to everyone when I meet so many new people constantly. There's also a lot of (usually older) doctors who say to tell patients nothing of your private life and stay staunchly professional, but that's obviously more difficult if you present androgynous.

Please ask any questions you have - I used to be a premed counselor as well.
I have been summoned and will reply shortly to OP. Thanks!
It is helpful to know I won't be the only one, thank you :)"	ktlqa3	NonBinary	15	1.0	2021-01-09 06:33:49
Anti-trans Bills and Intersex people	"One thing that pisses me off the most about the dozens of anti-trans bills that are popping up is that no one talks about intersex people. Even ignoring the fact that people should be able to make decisions about their gender and healthcare regardless of government interference, there are legitimate biological reasons for someone to appear and identify as neither male nor female.

Intersex people make up 1.7% of the population. Most are not identified as intersex at birth (and if they are their parents might not tell them) and may have no identifying characteristics until puberty or until they try to have kids. This means in a state like Texas over half a million people are intersex, but most probably have no idea. If the argument is that gender should align with biological sex then that’s half a million people who should identify as non-binary. 

I’m both intersex and non-binary and had no idea until I was 21 and stopped taking birth control. I started birth control at 15 because I had extremely light periods, wasn’t developing breasts and had a lot of weird hormonal things going on that my doctor thought birth control would help (she never even considered I might prefer a different hormonal treatment). Turns out my body doesn’t actually produce sex hormones like it should and I am medically better off when on testosterone. 

BUT I knew I was non-binary way before my doctors figured out I was intersex. I started going by a gender neutral nickname when I was 6. I cut my hair short when I was 7. Most people assumed I was a boy unless someone corrected them until I was in high school. I knew and everyone else sort of knew before there was any medical backing for my gender identity. 

The whole anti-trans thing is just stupid and based on a lot of complete misunderstandings about sex and gender. Just because the first doctor to see you after you’re born thinks you’re one thing doesn’t mean you should be stuck with the wrong sex/gender."	"the bills also carve out exceptions that allow doctors to continue giving unnecessary (and often harmful) genital surgeries to intersex children who don't consent to them, because this whole thing is really just about control
on that note.

you got transphobes/trans-haters claiming, that children are too young to get on puberty blockers.

meanwhile they are 100% ignoring the MASSIVE genital mutilation and forced HRT onto intersex people to FORCE THEM into the assigned gender, that came from some child mutilating abusing parasite in a white coat.

and another example is the MASS male genital mutilation going on called ""male circumcision"".

they are murdering babies (yes lots of babies die from this) and  harming them FOR LIFE both physically and mentally/emotionally. it is generally done without any pain medication and it changes FOR LIFE based on all that we do know. all while removing the most sensitive part of the male sexual organs.

\_\_\_\_\_

some freaking how these clear violations of bodily autonomy, that 100% go against the will of the child are nicely ignored by all those trans-haters/-phobes.

isn't that weird?  almost as if they are following a hateful agenda against transgender people and will grab onto whatever straws, that they can find, instead of ""carrying for the children.... ""
Thats so absurd considering they are all up in arms about consented gender affirming surguries. I know this isn't about logic and control but damn that pisses me off 🤬
best part are the talking points from those people.

they will actually say, that trans children get genital surgery before the age of 10.

that is the type of nonsense i am hearing over and over again. showing, that not even the slightest research gets done, or that they are deliberately spreading nonsense.

meanwhile genital mutilation going on with straight up newborns in the form of male genital mutilation ""circumcision"" and intersex genital mutilation and they are clearly all fine with that it seems...."	12drfjm	NonBinary	15	1.0	2023-04-06 17:29:21
The Oklahoma BAN on X gender markers for birth certificates needs more attention.	"I know that some people a not comfortable with having x on their ID because it outs them to people that could harm them. But to outright ban legal acknowledgement of non-binary people is really really bad. Not only could more states try this shit too, but I fear that it would make it even more difficult to receive healthcare either specific to non-binary people or not. Many medical professionals don't take us seriously to begin with, this would only embolden them. Not to mention advocacy for gender neutral restrooms in schools and workplaces. People will be harmed by this shit even if they aren't non-binary specifically, we know stories of even CIS people being harassed because of not fitting ""gender norms"" when it comes to restrooms.

I don't know where I'm going with this but we need to be watching this stuff more closely, it's only going to escalate from here. If anyone has any advice or ideas on what to do it would be greatly appreciated."	"thank you for sharing this. it reminds me of how the first pride was a riot. stay safe 💞
Stay safe, fam
Given that most states have followed with allowing X markers on DLs and birth certificates since the US government allowed them on passports, states are likely going to have a fight on their hands to keep the bans in place...but given the current SCOTUS makeup, that could be on the docket to be overturned as well. I wish I could offer more than support and the suggestion to reach out to your less conservative lawmakers in the state."	uus2gk	NonBinary	14	1.0	2022-05-21 17:41:12
Mental Health	"I've recently began seeking assistance with mental health issues I've been dealing with over the course of my life, and I've met a psychologist that I might feel comfortable enough with to divulge my gender identity to.

*Problem is*, the country I live in, South Africa, is not incredibly trans-friendly, especially in the healthcare system.

My psychologist is a Muslim, cisgender male, around 50-60+ years old, and I'm not sure how to broach the topic of sexuality and gender identity with him, especially where my nonbinary identity is concerned, or even whether he'd understand it.

Psychologists are people, and as such, I can't really expect him to respond perfectly, but I am terrified that he won't make an effort to understand or that he'd conflate my gender identity and sexuality with the mental health issues I'm there to find help with.

It's very common for psychologists to try and pathologize gender and sexuality and I don't want that to end up happening to me."		e2xca2	NonBinary	14	1.0	2019-11-28 12:23:42
Insurance denied my top surgery	"I just got the call that my insurance denied coverage for my top surgery because i ""dont want to be perceived as the opposite gender or want to live as the opposite gender."" 

I had even expressed my worry about this to my therapist and she said my letter should be fine and shes only ever had one denial and it was a long time ago befoe trans healthcare was more accepted. And all they care about is that I meet the criteria (which I do). I know I can appeal it I just feel like I should have said I'm a trans man from the start instead of saying im nb. 

I could just use some kind words or advice right now, I just feel lost and frustrated and offended."	"I’m so sorry you’re having to deal with this, it’s such bullshit. You are valid just as you are, and you deserve the surgery.
I’m so sorry this happened. Just remember you are valid no matter what and deserve the surgery. You can do this!!
This is shit. It will get better don't worry. Just try to enjoy your life as it is and I hope you are able to get it sorted in the near future. Have a wonderful day my fellow human
Also besides all the other stuff, which is all true, if you hadn't used NB, someone else later on would have run into the same thing. If you appeal however, that chance is smaller. So even though it's difficult for you, you helped someone down the line
Thank you <3
I really appreciate it, thank you <3
Thank you this is really encouraging, I hope you have a wonderful day too
Yeah that's a good point, I hadn't thought of it like that. Thank you 💜

Survey on socio-cultural barriers faced by individuals assigned female at birth when attempting to access reproductive healthcare!	"Hello! I'm conducting a study as part of my degree at university and it would be greatly appreciated if you guys could take a quick 5 minutes to fill out this survey :) [https://forms.gle/xXRDz8y2792XZDKe7](https://forms.gle/xXRDz8y2792XZDKe7)

I'm also looking for people to interview so if you have opinions or stories you'd like to share about your experience with accessing sexual and reproductive healthcare please message me!!"	"Done. I love what youre doing. I can tell you one thing that would make me leauges more confortable accessing healthcare and even in this quiz, if they didnt reffer to it constantly as ""female"" sexual and reproductive health. Especially since gender doesnt align with genitals. You could call it vaginal reproductive and sexual health, that would include anyone concidered AFAB without calling them female.
Is this open to people outside Australia? If so, you should strongly consider a ""Yes, I could not afford it"" option in the lack of opportunity question, or be prepared to be inundated with write-ins of that nature from the US.
Done!
Nice! Hope my answers are useful!
Done :)
I understand! I've changed the wording in the survey to replace the word female with vaginal

Healthcare question for non-binary patients	"Hey all, I have a question regarding healthcare and non-binary patients. To be clear, I'm a first year medical student, and I have started collecting patient histories in different clinics affiliated with my school.

Now, when a patient comes to a clinic for the first time, it's standard procedure to ask that patient a number of questions (e.g., what's your diet like? Do you feel safe in your neighborhood? Do you text and drive?). 

Eventually, we arrive at the sexual history of the patient. As medical students, we are taught to ask the following:

Have you been sexually active within the last year? If so, with men, women, or both?

My question is, might there be a better way to ask this question (men, women, or both?)? This is how we are taught to ask the question; however, I was wondering if there might be a more inclusive way to ask. 

I do apologize if this at all seems like a strange or intrusive question. I'd simply like to provide the best medical care I can for anyone who walks into my clinic doors someday. Moreover, I'd like to be the best person I can be! So if anyone has any comments regarding my question, I would appreciate it! I'd also love to know how healthcare in general might be better oriented for the treatment of non-binary folks, and how providers can better meet their needs! Thank you 😊"	"At planned parenthood, they ask 'do you have sex with partners with vaginas, penises, or both', which I think works pretty well and communicates all the actually relevant information. Like, I only sleep with men / male-aligned folks, so I'd answer your version with 'just men', but some of the guys I sleep with are trans, so I have engaged in activity with a partner with a vagina, which is medically relevant.
I think the key to rewording that question has to do with why it's being asked in the first place. I assume it's because certain demographics can have a higher overall risk for certain STIs and that kind of thing? 

I suppose you could reword it to ""what gender(s) have your sexual partners been?"" or something that's more open ended like that.
When I'm asked those questions, I re-frame my answers very pointedly.

""I have only had sex with folks with penises lately, but I have had sex with people with vaginas in the past. The people I currently have sex with are bisexual and polyamorous, and we are all tested regularly.""
I suggest asking if the patient is sexuality active, and if so, in what ways. Like, ask which parts they penetrate with or are penetrated in and whether it is by toys or parts of others, and which acts they use protection for. That should be sufficient to determine what tests etc should be considered. You can tell the patient it's to determine how often and which STI tests they should have.

Because someone's gender doesn't define the anatomy they have/use, it doesn't really make sense to ask about the gender of sexual partners.
From a pure data standpoint I see where you're coming from, but I know if I had a medical professional asking super explicit questions about exactly HOW I have sex during an otherwise routine appointment I would be super creeped out and might leave right then and there. Like even my gyno never asks questions like that when sexual history comes up.
If the question comes with an explanation of what the response is used for it's better than assuming activity based on gender.

It's the policy my Dr takes, but he's also queer so maybe that's what makes it more comfortable?"	ej2u4s	NonBinary	12	0.89	2020-01-02 19:26:08
Being a doctor as a non-binary person	Hey all, I'm a medical student and I think I'm probably non-binary (not certain yet though!) I'm worried about my future career, and was wondering if anyone had any experience being non-binary in any healthcare roles, or knew of any doctors/nurses/etc who are non-binary? Anything at all would be appreciated	"I have no experience, but we have a queer-friendly doctor's office in my city where people go for HRT or even just general check ups with someone who isn't going to judge.
I'm a researcher in the health sciences and I'm the only out trans person across multiple schools/colleges at my university. However, as a patient at my PCP's clinic, lots of health care providers there are out, PAs, nurses, phlebotomists, and doctors. Of all those, there are fewer out docs than any other group.
I identify as non-binary and have worked as a clinician for the last decade. It's come up with patients exactly twice for me, both times with patients who were in extreme emotional distress over gender-related issues and asked me. No other patient has asked or cared, and colleagues have been accepting.
 I'm a nonbinary nursing student and I know a nonbinary EMT! So far, I haven't had any trouble and neither have they. Most of my patients perceive me as an effeminate man, but at least one was visibly a little confused on what exactly I am- she wasn't uncomfortable though and was alright with me providing her personal care.
Look up Dr. Will Powers in Michigan. If you’re interested to be a physician, and you are willing to treat LGBT patients, you will probably have more business than you can handle, including patients who may come from out of state to see you. Dr. Powers is not LGBT, just a caring ally. He has some great videos talking about his practice; I believe he’s a specialist in HRT if not mistaken.
I can only talk as a patient....50 years of seeing a LOT of medical staff (i have cystic fibrosis, so am quite the frequent flyer). The things that are the most important to a patient are empathy, kindness, human connection. I have had the pleasure of being treated by people who present every kind of way, and human empathy and connection are the things that stick with me. You will be dealing with a lot of people in vulnerable positions, and I actually think your gender identity will be low down their list (in a good way, from your point of view). But of course, like in all public life, you will also be a role model to some. Hope that helps....Good luck and go for it!
I am NB and currently coursing through a doctorate in physical therapy. To me it has been a constant attempt at educating and teaching others to honor what we are taught. That the patient's needs, desires and values are just as important for the treatment as anything. Validating a person's identity makes them feel more at trust and as such, more likely to adhere to treatment. There is resistance amongst students to learn and embrace pronouns and gender concepts, but some do their best to understand.
I’m a psychiatry resident. I went to medical school in a very conservative area and it was very stressful as I was obviously “gender non conforming”. My administration at my school was not supportive. I took that into account when matching for residency and I matched to my 3 choice (so not bad at all!) and part of my ranking was based on how LGBTQ friendly the program and area was.

If you have any questions about rotations and interviews- being non-binary or otherwise feel free to DM me!
Thanks, I've been told the profession is quite tolerant. I'm more worried about the patients!
Good to hear that people manage to be out. Crazy that you're the only one in the university, do you think that's to do with the number of staff or is there a negative culture? If you don't mind me asking!
That's amazing! Do you work in trans healthcare or another area? Thank you so much for replying
hey! I'm another nonbinary medical student and I'm wondering how you deal with maybe being out to coworkers, and having people use your right pronouns. I'm only out to close friends and am a bit worried about older people's ability to use they/them in the workplace in the future.
That's so great to hear, thank you!
That's what I'm saying. Cater to a queer patient base.
There are definitely out students, but in terms of faculty and staff across the three schools I work with, I am the only person I know who is out. 

The U is in the midwest, and I think the location plays a role. Faculty and staff at most of the schools have attended trainings on the topic, but I consistently get misgendered across the schools. I'm being vague both to protect my own privacy and because I work on multiple research projects across schools at the U. I can tell you it was enough for me to decide not to pursue tenure track positions there, but I am staying on my research teams until those studies complete. I can also say that the U struggles to retain non-white faculty, especially in the health sciences. I think given those data points, it's fair to assume that folks either don't stick around or feel safe coming out there.
Just general healthcare, not trans specific.
I'm maintaining my record of it not really mattering much to anyone. Some folks, both patients and providers and usually older, seem to pick either he or she for me, which doesn't really bother me. I've got they/them on my nametag, and most of my coworkers use them and speak about me that way to patients.
 No problem! I hope things go well for you."	l4q7y5	NonBinary	11	0.93	2021-01-25 15:35:57
Advice on what to say in breast reduction consult?	"Hi all, I just got booked for a breast reduction consultation in 2 weeks! I have been dreaming of this for years and I am so excited but also so nervous about what to say to make sure I get what I actually want. I live in Canada, and provincial healthcare covers breast reductions for physical reasons, but not for gender reasons as far as I can tell. I have considered top surgery but it is not covered unless you meet very binary-centred criteria that doesn't apply to me (eg. on T for at least a year, can prove you are ""living life as a man"").

I'm currently a DD cup or bigger. I'd like to ideally be an A or AA cup. I am not skinny and I have a bit of a  belly, so I think for cis people, including the doctor, this will seem ""non-proportional""/not ""aesthetic"".  I'm concerned the doctor will try to urge me to only go down to a B or C - something I definitely do not want.

Any advice? I really want to know:

1. what to say to convince the doctor I ""need"" this reduction so that I get approved for health coverage (eg. what kind of back pain should I describe? what are the key words that will help me out here??)
2. how to convince the doctor to take me down to the literal smallest boobs possible, without making it about gender (for coverage reasons)
3. whether I should bring up gender/dysphoria at ALL or if you think it will hurt my chances!"	"I got mine reduced before I came out to myself and I just told my GP that my breasts were causing me pain, I couldn't find bras that fit at all and that I kept getting rashes. Note: they don't cover the fat on the sides of your chest under a reduction, so if you have a lot there you may want to save up so that it will look balanced. Also, depending on the type of surgery used they may be able to reduce your areola if you ask (if that's a thing you want). I have no idea if it'd be a good idea to tell them your gender though, I was still in hard denial.

I am now aiming for top surgery and I've been very clear that I ID as nonbinary, though I specified that I was very much on the boy side of center (even though I'm really more nebulous than that). I am on T though.

Theoretically my surgery has been approved but I'm still waiting (it's been over a year now) for an official message from the clinic that does it. My doctor told me it was approved though... soo.... 🤞

I hope you get what you need!

Edit: just read about your concerns about the surgeon going against your size idea. If it's anything like my reduction, by the time you're talking size you've already been approved and you're with the surgeon, so it's a bit safer. The size they go for depends on the width of your chest in the attempts to not flatten you out, since they can't really reduce width. I would try to explain to the surgeon that you actually want that flattened look and that you know what you're about. They will probably be confused, but just be adamant, it's your body after all.
It really depends on what province you’re in.
Thanks so much for this level of detail. Can you elaborate on what you mean by width of chest/flatten me out/reduce width? I have heard elsewhere that they can only go down a limited amount (eg to a C) due to how they do the surgery...was that not your experience?

Also what you mean by the fat on the sides? Isn’t it all boob? 

Thank you again!!!
I’m in Ontario and looking to get this covered by OHIP if possible.
Np! What I was meaning about the chest width is a very small-framed person with A cups will look different than a larger-framed person with A cups. The cup size isn't relative to body size, so if you tell your surgeon you want A cups they may understand that as you wanting relatively small breasts, not the minimum possible. Usually they are working with cis women, so they tend to assume their patients want noticable breasts still.

I'm not sure if there is a lower limit due to the surgery type (at the time I still assumed I was cis and just wanted smaller breasts, so I didn't push, just assumed they knew what I'd want) or if it's by practice, but it's worth being very precise with them.

As for the side fat, you might not have it, or very much of it, I'm quite a fat person so I have a fair bit of sideboob, and at least in my province they do not consider that part of the breast for the purposes of government funding.

Hope this helps!
I’m really not familiar with Ontario since CAMH ousted that conversion therapist Zucker, I know it used to be really tough to get any help if you were anything but 100% binary conforming and heterosexual back then. 

It looks like Ontario covers chest surgery for gender reasons as part of their gender confirming surgery. 

https://www.ontario.ca/page/gender-confirming-surgery

> Approval for chest surgery
To be approved for chest surgery you’ll need:
one assessment recommending surgery from a qualified doctor or nurse practitioner
the assessment must confirm that you:
have a diagnosis of persistent gender dysphoria
have completed 12 months of continuous hormone therapy with no breast enlargement (unless hormones are not recommended) if you’re seeking breast augmentation

It seems the only thing you would need to qualify is a diagnosis of persistent gender dysphoria.
thank you so much for looking this up! It is very different than what I found when researching this...ugh why is this info so hard to find online!!!! Anyway thanks for bringing this to my attention...maybe I will go through this consultation, see what they say, then use this as Plan B if I don’t have a good experience at the reduction consult.

Changing room awkwardness	As I’m presenting more masculine, I’m feeling more comfortable with myself. No longer feminizing my appearance for others’ gaze. The only place I’m feeling uncomfortable is in the locker room at work. I have to change daily (healthcare scrubs) and I use the women’s room as I’m afab and read as a women by many folks. I don’t have any desire to use the men’s room or modify how I’m presenting. I guess I’m just feeling that awkward teenage feeling I skipped when I was younger. Worrying I’m making others uncomfortable with my tomboyx boxers and body hair. That self conscious feeling of coming off as a creepy predator. It’s been a while since I’ve been around so many straight/cis people and I’m feeling a bit isolated. I’m not comfortable enough to be fully out at work, but trying to guess how people are perceiving me and worrying it’s negative.	"Is there a bathroom stall in the locker room? Can you change in there and then head out after?
There is and I’ve contemplated it, but don’t quite feel uncomfortable enough to yet. I’m hoping to get more comfortable and confident in myself and stop worrying how others perceive me as much, I guess"	sqsczp	NonBinary	9	0.86	2022-02-12 14:09:21

Seeking participants in Ireland to participate in a study on engaging with healthcare.	"Hi all,

I am a PhD researcher in the School of Applied Psychology, University College Cork, and I am conducting a study on the barriers to engaging and communicating with healthcare professionals and services. This research is aimed at identifying the barriers to engaging with health care services in Ireland in order to improve access to healthcare for trans and/or non-binary people.

Participation in the research involves taking part in an interview.  This interview will be conducted online through the use of Microsoft Teams. If you choose to participate in an interview, you will be sent a link that provides access to the interview. You do not need to set up a Microsoft Teams account to participate. This interview will be audio-recorded and is expected to take 30-60 minutes to complete. Recordings will be deleted immediately after they are transcribed verbatim and any potentially identifying information will be redacted from the transcript.

We do not anticipate any negative outcomes from participating in this study. However, as some of the questions asked of you are of a personal nature relating to your experiences as a transgender and/or non-binary person, it may be possible that engaging in these topics could cause distress. Should you wish to do so, you may choose not to answer any questions or bring the interview to an end at any time.  

The information that is provided by participants will help to gain an understanding of the barriers to healthcare for transgender and non-binary people in Ireland, and will also be used to form part of a report to healthcare professionals. 

This research is being conducted by Siobhan Thomas, PhD researcher in the School of Applied Psychology, University College Cork. You can contact me for more information at [siobhan.thomas@ucc.ie](mailto:siobhan.thomas@ucc.ie)

I've been pursuing top surgery since September, but I've run into a few roadblocks on getting the required letter of endorsement from a behavioral health professional. I see a therapist through my college, and she's very supportive, but our college's mental health services will not allow her to write the necessary letter. I also get meds for depression from a psychiatrist off-campus, and when I talked to him about it, he initially agreed to write the letter but backed out later in an email, saying that he's worried about surgery interfering with my depression and my plan to recover in the dorms. (The obvious responses are that 1. dysphoria itself is the greatest contributor to my depression and 2. I don't have anywhere else to go, but judging by his tone and the fact that he didn't ask me to explain anything, just stated his perspective, I'm fairly sure that it's more out of transphobia than actual concern, so I'm seeking help elsewhere.)

I have an appointment with a behavioral health professional next week at Fenway Health in Boston, which specializes in trans healthcare. Their behavioral health department often takes on trans people whose outside doctors are subject to either personal or systematic transphobia, and it's likely that I'll have the letter of recommendation at the end of that meeting. So, how do I make sure that the doctor I'm seeing is convinced of my dysphoria and need for top surgery? So far, I've made a list of my symptoms:
-perceived chest is flat, as opposed to irl chest
-Persistent feeling of wrongness, like a discomfort that's always there, something stuck in my throat that I'm perpetually conscious of. Like when clothing is itchy or fits badly
-Pushing down breasts, only wearing sports bras, hunching over to hide
-Not a dislike of the chest - I'm attracted to breasts and they're alright ones, they're just not for me
-Heavy contributor to depression - it takes a lot of mental energy to deal with the fact that dysphoria makes me feel shit and then still get up and do work and go to class
-Also applies to other aspects of gender - voice, facial shape, hips
-Got really severe during puberty. Has lasted fairly consistently since then. I found identity in being butch

But I want to make sure. What have you guys found success with saying to doctors? How can I make sure that the woman I'm seeing understands nb identities and the need for transition within that?

Tl;dr how do I convince doctors that my identity and dysphoria are real?"	"Honestly, I’m not saying *lie* to the doctor, but I’d only say what needs to be said. You don’t identify as a woman, your chest causes dysphoria, pain from binding, etc. If they ask about social transition/pronouns/etc, I’d answer truthfully. But I would focus on the dysphoria part and not launch into a detailed description of gender identity (unless they ask). The goal is to get a letter, say what needs to be said to make that happen
I would go to a therapist that you haven’t seen before for mental health things and focus specifically on the distress you feel about your chest and how much it would relieve dysphoria and depression to get top surgery. And that you understand surgery won’t cure your depression but it will greatly improve your quality of life.
Yeah I agree. There's a way to phrase things to make them sound more binary, and therefore more ""acceptable"" to doctors. "	aq4t9p	NonBinary	9	0.92	2019-02-13 09:25:33
Amab ramblings	"So I recently came out as nb. I Am amab I just have so many questions/thoughts, like what is a good neutral name my ""legal name ""  Nicholas, please dont say Nicky.  I want to go on hormones but I don't know how to start. Additonally i live in a place where you can be fired for being any sort of queer and I'm worried about losing my healthcare and access to hormones should I start. My body hair gives me dysphoria and I've been waxing / shaving for years and the only time I feel ""normal"" is when I'm hairless. What should I do when people who knew me with my old pronouns refuse to use my preferred pronouns, looking at you mom.... like I said this is just ramblings sorry for bothering you fine folxs. Additionally mods if this type of format is against the rules I'm sorry."	"For the name thing, what about Nic?  (No K.) I've known a couple Nicoles who went by Nic, and it totally fit them. 
Congratulations on coming out!!!
I haven't quite gotten to figuring out the pronouns but I tell you what, as AMAB I completely understand. In fact I used to be very involved and active with the Bear/cub community because it helped me be okay with my body hair. It worked for a bit but now I realize how MUCH my dysphoria is related to my body hair. But it's barely affordable to get it all waxed and my skin is sensitive to hair removal processes. 😓 
European Wax Center that's where I go there really affordable well relatively anyways what's the first time is free eyebrows
I don't think we have one of those around. I may check out going to the cosmetology schools for waxing. They tend to be cheaper
My partner works for them. they are in every state but Alaska as far as internationally idk

Non-binary with Center-Right Politics	"I’m writing this in case anyone else has had / is having my experience. As recently as a month ago, I believed gender was binary. I couldn’t understand what it meant to not feel strongly about your gender assigned at birth. Whenever I thought about it, I would often think “I don’t feel strongly about it, does that make me non-binary?” Admittedly, part of this was easy to dismiss because of my politics, which I would describe as center-right. I have left-leaning positions on some issues, particularly immigration and criminal justice reform, but not so much when it comes to the economy, healthcare, guns, etc. 

After spending a lot of time reflecting with an open mind, I’ve realized that I’m much more comfortable thinking of myself as something in between than I ever was thinking of myself as a man. Even typing the word to describe myself just now made me cringe a little. 

I’m guessing I’m not the only person who’s felt like they can’t be honest with themselves because of preconceptions about non-binary people as a group. If you’re one of those people, regardless about how you feel about anything else, I want to encourage you to approach the subject with an open mind. And if you do find you belong in this community, I want you to know you’re not alone."	"I’m a fucking commie, and anyone who downvotes OP out of spite for their politics is 100% a person who should look more closely at their behavior. Nothing op has stated would conflict with being a good person and a welcome addition to our community. Echo chambers are harmful and don’t allow for growth


This post was at -2, and op’s comment was at -1, and frankly I’m disappointed in some of y’all.
Honestly yeah. The right has just been ruined by really disrespectful people🥲
There is a misconception that all nonbinary people are leftists. I am a social libertarian and economic moderate and I am happy to discuss social and economic issues with people with whom I disagree. How else can I explore my opinions and be exposed to new ideas? Sadly there are many echo chambers that are intolerant of differing opinions.

Be sure to take a political compass test. There are others.
Has your recent self-discovery affected your politics?
Thank you, I came here to make exactly the same complaint about the petty downvotes. You might be a commie but I am pleased that we share values of humanity and inclusion. 😊
I couldn’t agree more. I’m a Libertarian (party membership and everything), but I decided to be broad in my post so more people might relate to it.
No, I hold all the same positions I did before.
😤🤝
This is fair. Non-binary (and/or trans) people are fundamentally *people*, and in a society that weren't so heavily cisnormative and transphobic, we would expect to see an equitable distribution across the entire political spectrum."	uijuhn	NonBinary	9	0.64	2022-05-04 23:41:12
Call For Interview Participants - Transgender, Genderqueer, and Gender Non-Binary Individual's Health Communication about Insurance	My name is Jonathan Baker, and I am graduate student studying health communication at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am currently doing a study about what insurance coverage means for Transgender, Genderqueer, and Gender Non-Binary individuals. I’m interested in how providers explain coverage to you, how you discuss insurance with others in your social circles, and what this means for you in terms of healthcare decision making. You do not need to be currently insured to participate in this study. If you choose to participate I will ask you to do two things: a brief demographics survey online, and an interview talking about your experiences. The online survey will ask you questions about your age, ethnicity, gender identity, etc. The interview will take place at a location and time that is most convenient and comfortable for you (e.g. in-person, over the phone, or video chat). Your participation in this study will remain anonymous to all others but the researchers. To participate you have to be at least 19 years old, and identify as Transgender, Genderqueer, or Gender Non-Binary. In total, participating in this study will take approximately 55 to 75 minutes. Feel free to share this post publicly or privately with your social circles, but please refrain from tagging others in these posts to protect their privacy. My email address is [jbaker@huskers.unl.edu](mailto:jbaker@huskers.unl.edu). Please contact me with any questions you may have.		aa27nt	NonBinary	7	0.77	2018-12-27 19:18:43
Do I want top surgery or just a reduction?	"Light TW for top dysphoria and mentions of trauma

Hi folks, I'm AFAB and currently identifying as gender fluid, but I have a problem: I really hate my chest. This summer I just moved up a size to 34E and I feel like crap about it. Since I first hit puberty I've gotten so much unwarranted attention and dangerous behaviour that makes me a headache for therapists, but not many people I know seem to understand why I'm mentally suffering for having an ""ideal body"" which I hate to hear.

The good news is my grandmother had reduction surgery in her twenties so reductions aren't viewed as a big deal in my family, but what if I want it all gone? I probably won't be considering surgery until my late twenties when I have a stable job and healthcare, but that doesn't mean I don't think about it a lot."	"do what you think will make you most happy
You don't say how old you are now, but assuming you're in your early to mid 20s, this gives you some time to get your head around it.

Do you know if your grandmother had any further breast growth after her reduction? I'm asking this because that is what happened to me. In some cases of breast reduction, the breasts grow back. 

I had a radical reduction, followed 8 years later by top surgery because mine regrew. I'd wanted top surgery to start with, but this was getting on for 30 years ago and would have probably been refused and seen as mutilation. However, due to the regrowth that would likely have recurred, I asked for full removal.

If there is a chance that your breasts could regrow after a reduction, could top surgery be reasonably explained in terms of preventing the chance of regrowth and further surgeries?
I'm in the same boat, and i think for myself Ive decided to get a reduction down to a small B cup if I can, just because I can present fem, masc, or androgynous without much effort in any direction (i.e. a push up bra for cleavage or compression undershirt for a flat chest) but that's only me. I would advise you to take time to really think about it, maybe keep track of how often you wish you were presenting completely flat chested and how often you wished you had smol breasts and see if one option seems more in line with your consistent desires
I'm twenty at the moment, and I'm not entirely sure if she experienced any growth and can't ask because she's dead, but it's likely considering that she still had a larger bust. It's possible that my mom *might* know, so I'll ask.
If she did, this would give you good reason to request full removal on the grounds they would likely grow again. 

Regrowth is more common than you'd imagine and likely caused by hormones."	pcjmqo	NonBinary	8	1.0	2021-08-27 09:01:48
Mom keeps suggesting breast reduction instead of top surgery, how can I get her to stop?	"So, my Mom is technically a boomer, if that explains anything. She was ok with myself identifying as non-binary and is trying to respect that, as well as my partner being non-binary. But it is aggravating when she keeps suggesting breast reduction instead of top surgery. She has at least updated to breast reduction as a precursor to top surgery, but to me that's not much better. I understand why, it's from a  financial aspect (I'm still covered under her military healthcare due to being on the Spectrum/filing for special coverage before she retired, and breast reduction is covered, whereas top surgery is not) and she's concerned that it would be too big of a change all at once, better to ease into it. But I don't want breast reduction, as even if it was an A cup it would still feel too feminine/not right and feed into my dysphoria. Plus my doctor mentioned any time a breast is cut into, it changes the shape and increases the risk of breast cancer, so I'd prefer a one and done. I see people who have undergone top surgery and it inspires me, makes me want that, but I can't get my mom to understand that. Should I keep fighting her at this point, or just give up and smile and nod, doing what I want anyway?

Edit: I finally did talk to my mom and explained how breast reduction would limit my future top surgery options, and she finally dropped it! She's a former lab tech and emt, so explaining the medical aspect worked as well as showing I did my research instead of making an impulsive decision helped her understand, so thank you for the suggestions!"	"personally, I'm a direct person when I can afford to be. here's my advice : depending on how well or badly you think this may go, you could tell her that topic is closed, and if/when she pushes the envelope, you make one attempt to set the boundary via conversation. ie: ""I told you, I'm not accepting comments on that topic. anyway, here's what's up with me that isn't private medical business..."" and then leave / walk away / hang up the phone if she keeps pushing. the hard thing is, if you're gonna try this, you HAVE to follow through, every time.

but, that's DEFINITELY not the right advice for every situation. like I said, I'm direct when I can afford to be.
You could try telling her any of the following:

\-having a reduction first reduces your options for top surgery later

\-think of it like an extreme reduction

\-you could always wear a molded bra if you wanted to be perceived more feminine on a given day, and if you get top surgery, you won't be FORCED to present as feminine

\-a breast reduction is actually a very limited procedure, and the surgeon can't do much in the way of contouring and is limited in how small they can go by the internal anatomy of the breast. With top surgery, you can tell the surgeon where you want your scars/what shape, how much fat tissue to leave, what shape you want your chest to be, and how big your nipples are/where they are placed. (in other words, sell it as having more options, and don't emphasize the part where you're probably going to choose very masculine options).

\-""mom stop suggesting a reduction, I do not want a reduction, and I have thought about this much more than you have, and nothing you can say will ever make me want a reduction. Please respect me enough to believe me when I tell you that I want top surgery.""

The thing I said to my dad that got him to back off on suggesting a reduction was that I wanted to look in the mirror and see *me,* instead of seeing someone who was failing at being a woman."	p738ek	NonBinary	8	1.0	2021-08-18 23:45:47
Dysphoria, binders, sensory/anxiety issues	"Hello, just joined. Please be gentle this is my very first post on reddit ever. I’ve been a long time lurker on many subreddits. 
I was wondering if anyone else deals with dysphoria around their chest but also has major sensory issues and anxiety that prevent them from binding? How do you deal with this?
I have two binders, both of which used to give me some euphoria but now I’m unable to wear them for more than five minutes without wanting to rip them off because I can’t breath. Which brings me back to the dysphoria of having to wear clothing with these things hanging off my chest. I am eventually planning to get top surgery. However, I am an American (need I say more?) and our healthcare system is garbage. 
I have resorted to just not wearing anything at all underneath, and trying to wear clothes that are as baggy as possible. It’s not that I have a big chest at all. I’m just hyper aware of it at all times.
Anyway, I’m just looking to see if anyone else struggles with this here and how they cope... or don’t.
Sending love."	"I have had this issue too, and my personal happy medium is wearing either unlined ""bralettes"" (Auden brand at Target) or an A-tank under my shirt. Granted, I have a fairly small chest, so that definitely won't be everybody's favorite option.
This is my exact experience, for a while I felt like I was the only one so it's oddly reassuring to know that I'm not alone. Right now I just kind of make do with compressive sports bras, and I recently bought TransTape but I was disappointed with how it worked and it was super difficult to use as well. I'm afraid I don't really have any suggestions for how to help, but know that you're not alone.
1) get a binder you can breathe in - if you can't breathe in it you need a size bigger

2) move to Canada for free healthcare (also I would make you cookies)
I sometimes use trans tape instead of binding. Most of the time I wear a sports bra or shelf bra that doesn’t give me any emphasizing and that’s better for my body than binding."	tydpya	NonBinary	8	1.0	2022-04-07 13:59:27
Nonbinary Professionals	"Hello all! I am a 26 year old AFAB nonbinary human who is still struggling with my identity. Part of why I struggle with this identity is because I haven't seen much representation of nonbinary professional that I can aspire to be like. It is difficult to imagine a future when you do not have someone to look up to.

I am an ICU RN and I feel that expressing my identity in the workplace would be difficult. I ear that it would affect my ability to be seen as a serious professional by physicians, patients, and their family members. I also worry that this would be confusing to my patients which is why I continue to use my full birth name at work.

Many of the nonbinary humans I have seen on the internet and out in the world have been either teenagers or people in more artsy professions. I'm glad that these people are able to express themselves but it is difficult for me to imagine myself expressing myself in a very corporate healthcare setting.

I am excited to hear any stories or advice that you all are willing to share! 

Thank you, 

J"	"I work for the NHS, and I'm out to my colleagues as non binary. My email signature has my pronouns and a small non binary flag. I've honestly not had issues with my colleagues, they all try their hardest with my pronouns and have become more aware of equality issues in general since I came out to them. I feel supported and appreciated for being myself, and I live my truth by wearing clothes that are professional but traditionally masculine. I wear a rainbow lanyard with associated pride pins so that people feel able to approach me... It's amazing being out and proud!
I am finishing up my PhD then will (hopefully) be working in academia in a stem field. So not exactly like your situation, but I do know what you mean about not having representation of non binary people in more professional/less artsy careers

I think one important thing is to decide what battles you want to fight. Is it important to you to have your patients call you your preferred name? Is it important to you to have your coworkers use your correct pronouns? Is it important to you to explicitly come out to any of these people? You don’t necessarily need to tell everyone your identity/pronouns/name, if that’s what works for you. Maybe you feel ok not being explicitly out at work, you just want support at home and with friends. Or maybe you can do some small things at work that will help you feel more visible. In my experience, it’s easier to get people to use a preferred name than to use they/them pronouns, so maybe you could try just the name. Or you could get some kind of pride pin/button/card/etc to display.
I feel your struggle OP! I’m also 26 and starting residency this year and had my pronouns (they/them), and thus everybody’s pronouns, put on the “meet the residents” face sheet. It was only kind of nerve wracking.

I’m nervous about how it will go but I plan on being out first with my colleagues etc and I don’t really plan on being like “hi I’m Dr.Appendix I use they/them pronouns” with my patients. Things about me as an individual are really only pertinent if they are therapeutic things I can bring to the relationship, or if a patient is fixated on them. I want to just roll with it. I am pretty androgynous so already in medical school I have had some patients be weird initially about me being their doctor, but a lot of it is easily solved by asking about their concerns etc. 

Not sure if that was helpful, but it’s my plan atleast.
Thank you for sharing your story with me. It is nice to hear tales of respectful workplaces! When you entered your job were you initially open or was it a gradual process? I am about to hit my year at my job and only two of my coworkers are aware of the fact that I have a differing gender identity.
I absolutely have had these exact same thoughts. For me I don't think people using my preferred name or pronouns is important in a professional setting. I can separate those things and I do often offer my preferred name as an option when people ask me what I like to be called since it is a variation of my legal name.

Where I run into conflict is when I begin to make friends with coworkers. I don't want to become a thing that is talked about or made a spectacle of at work.

Thank you for sharing your experience!
As a healthcare provider I relate to you SO much. I don't share my queer identity with my patients ever. However, when I do connect with a patient and they inquire about what I prefer to be called I do give them my preferred name. It's a simple way to develop a good therapeutic relationship with my patients and also get to use my preferred name. 

I'm proud of you for being out as a healthcare provider. I've never met another healthcare provider with an openly queer identity. People can be weird about the androgynous presentation but if I sense weird vibes I usually just try me best to find a way to connect with them as a person and we usually get along just fine. 

I hope things go well for you in residency :)
I was open about my sexuality from the outset, and I think most people were aware I was a bit different due to my personal presentation. It was more gradual with my gender identity because people can be inadvertently transphobic whilst being fine with homosexuality...

I became the educator of the office, so ended up teaching my colleagues a lot about gender and sexuality, which I think made them wonder how I knew so much about it 😂 

Eventually, the misgendering got too much for me and I gradually started coming out to individual colleagues. Then one of my senior colleagues made a slightly transphobic joke and it really upset me, so I kinda came out formally shortly afterwards because it wasn't ok for him to use that language, which was something I discussed with him (and he took really well).

I came out via email, so that everyone knew at the same time and it gave me a chance to explain it better than I could have done in person. It also gave my colleagues a chance to ask questions that they might be unsure of how to ask face to face. It's an ongoing process, and I still have to remind people about pronouns sometimes, but it's worth it to be myself in the workplace.

I also bought a book about pronouns for my colleagues to read, and it went down really well! This is the book, in case you're interested in doing something similar: [An Easy Guide to They /Them Pronouns](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/dp/1620104997/ref=cm_sw_r_other_apa_i_-Z60EbP1HD23W)

Terribly confused- I envy trans women, but I'm already trans-masculine	"I should preface this by saying this is not something that was easy to share for me. I've been struggling with these feelings for so long, expressing them was very hard.


So, for a bit of background, I'm in my early 20s, AFAB and realized I was trans when I was 14. Before that, I didn't know trans men existed, only trans women. Discovering there were other people who felt like me was like a revolution. I struggled with my country's medical healthcare system for years until 3 years ago, when I was finally allowed to go on T. 
In the meantime, I explored my feelings about gender and realized I didn't exactly want to be a man, I just didn't want to be female. I quickly started identifying as agender.


I loved the voice T gave me, the body shape and stamina, however the libido has been overwhelming and feeling kinda like poison, while the hair is kind of a mixed bag of feelings. About 8 months ago, I got top surgery which also was an immense relief. But for some reason, something felt terribly off and for the longest time, I just couldn't put my finger on it.


I'm terribly jealous of trans women. Not trans men, not cis men, not AFAB nb people- *trans women*(alongside some AMAB nb people). I don't know exactly what it is: envy over having been born with more masculine body? fitting in the role of a woman better than I ever could? some internalized misogyny relating to bodies again?


I have no clue. All I know is that while transitionning has made me feel immensely better, I feel that if I had been born with a male body, I would've also ended up transitionning.


I really don't know what this is, and I feel like a creepy fetishist or a ""fake"" transtrender having these feelings.


I've also been looking into nullos (people looking to remove any genitals and secondary sexual characteristics), to whom I relate a lot, but while getting nullification surgery as an AMAB person looks close to GRS for trans women, getting it as an AFAB person looks to other more like FGM and I don't really know how to pursue it without looking like a nutcase. The main appeal behind it, besides the obvious dysphoria I have, would be that nullification looks the same for every sex, and that I would probably look like an AMAB person who's been nullified than the other way around just because guys are the ones who get it the most (and also I pass as male).


Maybe being nonbinary and not having an actual target ""sex"" that exists for it is what's causing the issue here, but it's just so confusing. I don't know if I'm weirdly fetishizing trans women, AMAB bodies, or just having a weirdass nonbinary meltdown.


This probably looks really really weird to most, but if any of you has any clue as to what's going on, or any past experience in mind they can relate to this, I'd love to hear it. Thank you in advance for your help."	"Sad to see you removed it. Shoot me a message if you need to talk. No judgement.
hey, thank you for being so open and sharing your feelings! the more people talk about things that they feel maybe only they experience the easier it is for others who also feel the same, so, thank you! i’m afab as well and i’ve always felt that if i was amab i would still be trans and still have my goals surrounding gender and my body to land somewhere in the middle. i’ve been jealous and often felt that i should have been transfem amab more than the way i am right now. i think that gender is essentially a Huge Mess, super complicated, and often finding answers as to “Why?” is invalidating to all of our diverse experiences. it makes sense to me why we may feel jealous of amab transfem people. the reason that i think i feel that way sometimes is because i like being feminine and i like certain clothes and expression that make me dysphoric because the combination of a pretty dress and my body equals an image that has brought me dysphoria my whole life and makes me look like a girl. i think that i am sometimes jealous of people who achieve an androgynous look through actively feminizing themselves. in that case i am talking about other nonbinary folk, amab tranfems as i mentioned. i think i also am jealous of trans women because they have that autonomy to choose womanhood and whatever version of it that they like. i didn’t choose and don’t want womanhood but that has always been pushed on me as an afab person. so, seeing someone feminine who fought for it makes me jealous because i want that as well even if it is not the same identity and i’m going in a transmasc direction with my body and presentation. someday my body will be more masculine and that’s when i’ll feel comfortable in a dress! i hope this makes sense and helps a little."	cwt2h9	NonBinary	7	0.89	2019-08-29 00:01:09
NY resolutions -- transitioning & doctors	"Hi all!

2018 is the year I take care of myself a bit better. This means doctors (for a lot more than just transitioning - life-threatening allergies, progressive hearing loss, a couple of other fairly minor things). 

Before I talk to the doc about being trans/NB, I want to arm myself with ALL the information, and y'all seem to know what's what!

I'm hoping to talk to the doc about hormone therapy - not as far as T, but like an estrogen blocker that would mimic menopause or something. Google is generous with info about AMAB antiandrogens, and full AFAB HRT but pretty limited with the info I'm looking for (could be my region tho).

Likewise if someone has any experience with this under the Ontario healthcare system, any intel is much appreciated. 

<3 happy new year everyone!
"	"Keep in mind that your body needs hormones to function properly - they do more than just alter outward appearance. So be sure to read up on all the health risks related to taking estrogen blockers without taking testosterone so you're sure that those are risks you're willing to take before you start taking blockers.

For getting a more typically androgynous apperance, if that is what you want, I've known a few genderqueer people who were cafab who decided to go on testosterone for just a couple of months and then stopping. Some changes will reverse when you stop hrt, but some will remain, so they were able to stay more or less as androgynous as they wanted."	7n1bxu	NonBinary	7	0.9	2017-12-30 12:31:08
Navigating enby/ Getting clocked cis	"So I'm a 40 something, late bloomer enby queer type person. The reality of this is that I have always been queer ever since I can remember, I have long been an ally of the lgbtqia+ communities, and so I am not completely new to the neighborhood. Because of this, I am being welcomed into a lot more queer spaces, and it feels so great to be included and feel some sense of belonging. However, there are still bumps in the road for me.

On a couple occasions now, I have been clocked cis male in a queer space, and honestly I get it, and carry this weird guilt about it. As in any culture, there are some folx who are more ""visually representative"" of the culture, and lets just say no one is electing me to represent the queers any time soon. 

Because of this, I get in the weird trauma loop of feeling guilt/ imposter syndrome for entering queer spaces in the first place, so then I feel anxiety when invited or when considering joining an activity, and then depressed because I don't feel a part of my community...

Maybe it's just growing pains and I need to give it time.  I'm just looking to unpack this if anyone wants to take a crack at it. Im safe and no one should have any concern for my well being, all good there. I'm actually in the process of finding a new therapist, and stoked to be getting back to that now that I have a bit of healthcare. Looking forward to your thoughts..."

I really dont understand it myself, other than a deeply rooted belief in sexual dimorphism, and the belief that ""males"" are ""biologically"" a higher class designation, which assumes that ""females"" are naturally oppressed, instead of inflicted by systemic structures of oppression. 

It leaves out the fact that, for example-- a non dysphoric trans woman who defines herself as such is a woman regardless of how she is perceived on the outside. The same goes for anyone, and how they identify. That is to say, we cannot be reduced to our biological functions alone, and plus -- society views us as transgressions to the system when we do not conform perfectly to its standards, it doesnt mean solely to ""look non binary / queer"" in order to resist it.

I am very sorry you are being treated this way, imo the broader community needs to be up on their gender self-determination knowledge. And not assume that everyone conforms to cisheteronormativity, and they themselves should stop assuming everyone they see is cis or het based on stereotyping their outer appearance.
Great example, and thanks! So helpful ☺️"	10hrtd0	NonBinary	8	1.0	2023-01-21 13:57:12
Chest binding + fibrocystic breasts?	"Hi all, I'm new here and hopefully this kind of question is allowed, I haven't been able to find any info about it.

I've known I'm nonbinary for about a year and binding my chest for a few months now and it feels great. I love going to work with my binder on and a button down shirt, I'm more confident than I've ever been and it's helping immensely not just with dysphoria but with body image issues in general.

Currently I'm being worked up by my doctor for a breast lump and pain, and because of the pain I haven't been able to use my binder for a couple of weeks now. He thinks it's probably just fibrocystic changes, which is great (benign!) but it involves having more dense and sometimes tender/painful breast tissue (less great). I work in healthcare (more on the clerical side of things) and specifically see this issue in patients a lot, so I'm at least familiar with it, but something I've not seen or been able to find information on is whether or not people still manage to bind after being diagnosed with this. 

I'm also a little nervous to talk to my doctor about it in case his answer is to just stop. I've considered breast reduction but I have a lot of health issues and even just getting moles removed is a big deal, so it's not ideal. Binding really seemed to be the answer for me and to say I'm disappointed is an understatement. (I'm also really worried that it isn't fibrocystic changes, but this is what my anxiety brain has latched on to hahah)

Tl;dr: Might have fibrocystic breast changes, can't find info about continuing chest binding with this condition, stopping binding would be a huge blow and I'm hoping somebody has experience with this.

Thanks folks :)"	So I know you posted this forever ago but my fabricystic breast have been awful this month so I was going through posts to see if anyone had suggestions on things. One thing my doctor told me to try when it’s been bad in the past is compression and heat. I’ve had to stop binding a long time ago which was upsetting but for a different reason. But sometimes I’ll wear it for a short period of time with a heating pad and it helps my pain a bit. I don’t know what that means as far as long term wear and binding but that’s been my experience at least :)	im23t6	NonBinary	7	0.9	2020-09-03 20:59:46
NEED EMOTIONAL SUPPORT BADLY!!!!	"Hello Friendly pals your friendly neighborhood Non-binary  pal here and I am in dire need of emotional support my gender dysphoria is really bad these days since I just got my period which is one of the worst causes of my dysphoria so I just want someone I can talk to.
(My Facebook name is Phoenix Ameri the one with the cat pfp) 

I don't really like my family so I'm not comfortable of coming out to them and to say my mother is really religious so that's one of the reasons I'm scared of talking to her (if I come out I'll have to say to her that I'm an Apatheist too!) And one of the sources of my trauma is religion itself so I really wouldn't like it if I come out to her both as an Apatheist and Non-binary then she'll just say that I'm lost and need to pray to God (yep she's those type of religious people) Also context! my family isn't really that open minded, my dad always assumes that when someone drives badly then the driver is a woman then I'll go laugh at his face when I see that the driver is a man, then there's my mother who didn't like my phone case because it's a ""boy blue"" she also thinks that when a guy plucks his brows then he's gay so yup my parents are a bunch of stereotyping pricks  

So yep I feel really helpless right now, my mother has contacted a therapist but I haven't actually talked to them (I can't even guarantee if that therapist is gonna be LGBT+ friendly because they're just a local therapist that we don't even need to pay for) 

And to say in the end of the day even if my family accepted me it would still be useless since being trans or Non-binary isn't allowed in my country (yep I live in a religious country with a shitty government) and my family isn't that rich to pay for my healthcare needs or move to another country 

I've also haven't gone to school for more than a year! My parents doesn't know that I didn't go to school for months but my teachers actually still gave me grades and passed me for the school year even doe I didn't contact them about my depression that being said because of all that I have cut off my friends for more than a year now I've also moved to a different school but again I stopped my school year this year since I had to tell my mother about my depression and she agreed so that's something I'm happy about 

Long story short I just really want a helping hand, been depressed for more than a year now and even attempted Su!cide a few months ago but then I remembered that I wanted to celebrate my birthday and that I still want to become an Astronomer or a biologist in the future but I feel like I can't hold on this life any longer living and pretending as someone I am not.
 I don't have anymore real life friends or online friends that could support me because my family isn't there so I just really really want someone to talk to (⊃｡•́‿•̀｡)⊃ please contact my Facebook messenger"		rbjedd	NonBinary	8	1.0	2021-12-08 05:09:28
how do i go about telling my non binary friends i want to pay for their top surgeries?	"how do i go about telling my non binary friends i want to pay for their top surgeries?

i have no desire to have wealth for mylar and i’m fortunate enough to have a well paying job and i can probably get a promotion soon. i’m single and don’t care about material luxuries. the least i can do is help my comrades out with a surgery that will make them more comfortable.

i know you need to be on HRT for a while before the surgery, i’m also unsure if some of my comrades are on it. 

should i just approach them with a check and be like “Hey let’s talk. I know and love you and i want to give you something. i make way too much money to keep it all to myself and frankly i couldn’t give less of shit about spending it on me. i love you and want you to be happy and comfortable in your own body. to have this for HRT treatment and top surgery. it’s nothing to me, so please accept it and take it, no strings attached of course and do as you please, do it your way. if there’s any left over let’s make a fund to pass it on to our next comrade seeking top surgery”

is this crossing a boundary or am i being too over the top? i know it’s a big decision, but fuck this country and privatized healthcare because this shouldn’t even cost anything."	"I would say if it's something they desperately want and confide to you in, you could offer it. Just out of the blue would be a little weird to me

Maybe if they make the go fund me you could donate the full amount or something? Idk it seems kinda cheesy but I think it’d be a nice surprise. Also you’re such a good friend for doing this for them, they’re lucky :)
Oh I see, I'd say go for it!

You're a good friend
i like that! now that i think about though, doesn’t go fund me take a % of the donations?

Oh yeah I forgot they did that, that sucks :/ apparently its like 2.9% which is a lot

[TW miscarriage] Experiences of healthcare	"Hello, so I (afab 30) recently found out I was pregnant after trying for a long time. Sadly this week I miscarried and just wondered if anyone has had similar experiences. 

The nurses and radiographers were lovely but kept referring to me by she/her. I was wearing my they/them badge but was feeling very vulnerable so didn't correct them at the time. I want to send them some feedback and let them know how kind they were but also feedback about using incorrect pronouns for me. Has anyone done this before and how did you go about it? I'm in the UK if that helps so was under NHS care."	"You are valid and it is ok to leave this feedback. I support you.
Sending you love and comfort, that's double rough 

I'm in the states so it's a bit different, if they have an office for diversity, equity and inclusion you could send it there, or check if they have any patient advocacy departmets (may be with your paperwork).
I'll have a look on the trust website and see if they have a feedback form. I don't want it to be a negative as they were so lovely otherwise, it was just something that stood out when I felt vulnerable."	v5l3l8	NonBinary	6	1.0	2022-06-05 19:51:25
What is happening	So the website for my healthcare provider in Tennessee completely took down all their hints or even straight up content for gender affirming care, which brought me so much hope. the profiles of the doctors have it removed, the page of the clinic is completely gone, all of the content nowhere to be found. Was just there, now gone. I wish I could say so much more but I’m gonna have to leave it at this for now and just vent a little bit	"It was probably in response to the Tennessee GOP targeting and calling for investigations into clinics offering gender-affirming care, but I can't say for certain.
Fuck that’s so scary

Transfemme enby questions!	"Hi all,   


I just wanted to get a little bit more information about HRT for transfemme enbies. I'm in a really solid relationship with my finacee right now (and we'd like to have kids one day!), so I was hoping to get some more information in case I ever feel like I'd need E to help me around.

&#x200B;

1: What was the conversation like with your healthcare provider like? Like, the enby part (and in my case not really wanting to transition all the way). How did you know who to talk to in order to start this process?

&#x200B;

2: Can my finacee and I still have babies on E? >.< lol... (I really don't know!) Or would I need to bank sperm?

&#x200B;

Thank you everyone! <3"	"Transneutral nonbinary person over here, but same hormones and process. The conversation with the endocrinologist went very smooth and easy or me. I got a referral letter from my gender therapist, which went over specifying I'm nonbinary, what my dysphoria entails, what my transition goals were and what kind of expectations and information I already had about HRT. I went to the appointment with my spouse (and our toddler) and we discussed all of that in detail. He let me know there was a variety of goals and outcomes for hormones and asked what my specific goals and concerns were. I had been doing a lot of research on the process, effects, side effects and risks of HRT for years before I came to the decision to start, so I had a pretty well informed and realistic understanding of everything going in. He made a plan with me for starting on a very low dose, checking in by phone and increasing the dose gradually every 30 days, then having another appointment at 3 months with blood panels to check my hormone levels and discuss progress. I'm 2 months in on that right now. 

&#x200B;

When I discussed my plan to go on HRT with my spouse, we talked about fertility. We have 2 kids now, a 4 year old and a 20 month old. We hadn't made any plans for any more, but decided that if for some reason we wanted more down the road, we would pursue fostering and/or adoption. With everything related to going on hormones, they tell you there's a variety of reactions and results, because everyone's body responds differently due to a lot of different variables, but that sterility is a possible temporary effect of androgen blockers and E, that could be permanent after you've been on a while (Gigi Gorgeous related a story about this on her youtube channel before). So they generally recommend that if you're not sure about having kids or know you definitely want them, to either wait or freeze a sample for later use (which costs money to store). I explicitly relayed the details and outcome of that conversation with both my gender therapist and the doctor when discussing my transition plans. 
Hi! You would need to bank sperm as long time HRT can cause infertility. You'll be warned of this by professionals anyway I would imagine, but if I remember rightfully, Gigi Gorgeous (I think!) Had a video on her process of going through it. It might answer some questions from a personal experience :)
I can’t answer (2). As a trans masculine nb person on hrt, my best advice for (1) is to focus on how you have dysphoria, you know the impacts of hrt including the risks, you are sure you want it. Very few of my doctors actually asked about identity. They care more about do you match the diagnosis of dysphoria. I never hide my nb identity from them, but I also don’t bring it up unless they ask. 
I'd like to encourage you to adopt if you're having kids instead of making new ones. You wouldn't be able to, anyway, as the others have pointed out. "	azbto8	NonBinary	8	0.91	2019-03-10 03:51:09

Have your experience counted! NHS Trans Healthcare Survey	"Action for Trans Health London are recording the experiences of trans patients accessing NHS healthcare. Wait times at NHS Gender Identity Clinics are criminally long, with many trans patients waiting **two years or more** for a first appointment. Moreover, GICs are failing to keep appropriate records of their wait times, meaning that this crisis may continue to go largely undocumented.

ATH London are a trans-run organisation aiming to support the trans community by recording that data and making our voices heard. The survey is written by trans people, and is open to **all trans people who have experience as an NHS patient in England**. The data will shed light on the extent of the crisis and its effect on trans people. With real data on what we go through, real solutions to service inadequacies can be developed.

Friend in crisis. Share thoughts on transfem and transmasc?	"TW: references to enbyphobia

I have a non-binary trans friend (she/they) who is an emotional wreck after being gaslit by another trans person into questioning their identity. I'm gutted for them and want to give them role models, examples, arguments, etc. to show they are valid as they don't entirely believe me.

The thrust of the enbyphobia, was to assert that ""trans-feminine"" is just about gender expression because allegedly ""feminine"" means expressing femininity, and that my friend was inventing a new meaning for the word by using it otherwise. Then shared some other toxic bile about non-binary people I won't repeat.

Err nope, clear gaslighting. [Read a decent dictionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/feminine). When I go to the *feminine hygiene* section of the supermarket or pharmacy, that doesn't make me femme, ffs. I'd rather they were just called sanitary products to be inclusive of trans mascs and trans men, but the point stands that feminine can mean something different to femme expression.

""Trans-masculine"" and ""trans-feminine"" mean what they mean to the people who use them. This person forgot that we can't know the inner lives of people by their labels, which never capture the true beauty of each and every queer person.

I can however read someone by the smell of their bullshit. What this person was trying to do, was pander to transphobes by invalidating non-binary genders, in the false hope that it will legitimise their identity in the eyes of a cis world. Sadly it won't, because every concession to queerphobic people just shifts the goalposts back, and they go again with their phobia on what remains of us. And newsflash to this person who was cruel to my friend -- medical gatekeeping is incompatible with your invalidation of non-binary genders, because the DSM criteria for gender dypshoria allows for alternative genders. The DSM shouldn't define any of us, but if it does matter to you, at least be logically consistent.

It's not like I don't get it. Transitioning can involve ridiculously long waiting times for healthcare and legal recognition, and that is absolutely crap. But the solution isn't to close the gate behind us when the cis heteronormative patriarchy gives us a few crumbs of recognition. You never know when society will put us back the other side of the gates we create. And why do we settle for crumbs? Let's have the whole cake!

Pepping up my friend up with arguments like this seems to be helping, but it's just my words. I was wondering if anyone could share their take on transfem/transmasc identity to prove to my friend they are not alone?"	"[deleted]
Trans masculine does not mean you are masculine and trans feminine does not mean you are feminine.  The primary use of the term is to indicate transitional directions, trans masc being AFAB trans people and trans fem being AMAB trans people.

Trans masculine people are not inherently masculine, there are trans men who are femboys.  Trans feminine people are not inherently feminine, there are trans women who identify as butch.

From google (economist.com):
""Trans masculine identities are those of people who were assigned female at birth, but do not identify as female. We are a broad group of people who may identify as male, non-binary, agender, or “genderqueer”.""
The fact that there are people in the LGBTQ+ community doing the same thing to others what homophobes/transphobes do and say to them is insane to me. You'd think that they would be more understanding of identities but instead they try to cater to whatever they feel like cis/hetero people are willing to accept and try to make things more palatable to them. I heard in a video once that trans people (in this case enby people) will have a harder time ""proving"" their identity rather than saying they're not trans etc. At the end of the day, an individual knows what their identity is more than any other person which makes them 100% valid. Sorry that turned into a rant LMAO but I hope your friend is feeling better.
This is a wonderful answer! Turns the whole issue on its head... Tysm and just to say you are awesome!!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Thanks, and well put!

I'll share your words with my friend! 🙏
PS this is what my friend uses the term to mean. Such gaslighting to tell her she was making it up!
No need to apologise, completely agree!

My friend is starting to see the light, a bit scared of coming on social media themselves right now so tysm for you, and everyone who has shared
Lol sorry, I totally got self conscious and deleted my post. I saved it thoo :

To me, feminine has a cultural meaning, but is also an identity. It is not mine however! Or masc.

The only fem label I use is femboi as an expression. I am an apora & fluid nb person. My gender identities are more xenic in nature. I am transnb.

I get people who occasionally call me fem but I reject that label. I am flamboyant and ✨shiny ✨

I have gone on an on in this subreddit about it. I dont consider myself feminine or the things that I do to be feminine.  I am outside of the western cultural meaning of femme.  I have also joined in support of the non binary people who look like me who want to be considered non binary and not feminine.

But at the same time, I feel like I am also making room for people who use labels in ways that dont ""match"" to people's perception of what it ""should"" be doing.

Sometimes people get into this mindset that everyone has to be the same, and are very reductive as a result. People are diverse and especially when it comes to our gender, sexuality, and sex -- saying it is a mere spectrum does not do it justice. It is way more fluid and bigger than that.

That is why we should be respectful of people's self-determination and believe people when they tell us who they are instead of fighting them on their identity.

There are few things I would fight a person on their identity about, but even if your friend was ""redefining feminity"" I wouldn't care because I have my own meaning and relationship to the concept which is likely different from your friend.

In a way I actually am redefining the public's perception of people who feel & look like me, re-defining the part of them that believes in binarist, reductive, bioessentialist nonsense.

Tell your friend she is valid and I hope they have a great day!!
There isn't really another commonly held definition for the word.  I've seen some people think trans masc means ""only trans men"" and some think it's ""AFAB trans people who aren't binary men"", both are just misinformed though.  Their misunderstanding is usually just a product of where they've seen the word used contextually.

What were they saying it meant?  I'm a bit confused on that.
👍😊👍
So they were saying that masculine and feminine only refer to gender presentation, and inferring from that, that trans masc and trans fem are only about presentation.

It was all part of trying to make my friend feel like their identity was superficial, also some transmed stuff, seems like transmed gatekeeping and enbyphobia like to team up.

The fact that my friend has dysphoria apparently counts for nothing, apparently.

Can't go on puberty blockers until I'm done puberty :/	Over a month ago I (16 afab) bit the bullet and asked my doctor about starting puberty blockers, my parents are fine with blockers but nothing else until I'm in my 20's so this is all i could of done for now despite really wanting to start T. My doctor was super nice and since she has never had a trans patient before, she gave me a referral to this transgender youth clinic, the only one I know of in my country. A few days ago the referral went through, and because God is cruel, it will take 6 months to get an assessment and around 14 for an actual appointment. By the time I can start BEGINNING to get them ill be basically done puberty and will then have to wait years until I'm allowed T and also have to pay for them out of pocket since I will no longer be under my parent's insurance and our universal healthcare doesn't cover it. I understand hormones dont make you valid or whatever but it fucking sucks to look at yourself trying your hardest to look the way you want and feel like you're playing dressup and being a mockery of how you actually should look. There is no way for me to pass at all without some sort of transition, I'm extremely short, have a round undefined face, titties that keep getting bigger, and long hair, which i cannot cut because without it I would look hideous. So Yay I got my referral, but I will have to wait around a decade to actually use it :/	hello!! i’m around your age,, have you tried using makeup to present more masculine? i personally use a darker shade to sharpen my cheek bones and jaw line and i try it darken and mess up my eyebrows for a more masc look,, if your “tits” are one of the issues see if your parents would allow a binder if not sports bras always help compress a bit. for the hair of it’s not parted in the middle try that! or i tend to slightly gel my hair back so it’s more masc you can always look up masc hair styles!	msxn1a	NonBinary	5	1.0	2021-04-17 19:46:14

top surgery- Unsure if I want nipples?	"Hello folks!


I’m going to start a gofundme to save up some for top surgery. Yay!! 


I’m unsure if I want nipple grafts or not. I plan on getting double incision, and I’ve heard healing after surgery is easier without nipples. I’ve also heard it can be slightly less expensive, a HUGE plus if possible. 


Im unemployed and i have ptsd, cant work atm. Had to quit my job cause I kept having panic attacks at work and i couldnt take it anymore. I got diagnosed with ptsd, trying to get my shit together and heal. I likely wont be able to use my insurance since im covered through my conservative christian grandfather’s military insurance, and there’s no way they’d cover it if I’m not on T. I know of a relatively local doctor who’ll do top surgery on enby folks not on T as long as they have a therapist note. So my plan is to crowdfund the money and get the surgery. I might as well try, hope of improvement feels better than sitting and doing nothing.



TLDR: Does getting nipple grafts or not getting nipple grafts effect the price/healing time of surgery? Are there any better options for healthcare crowdfunding, or is gofundme my best bet for US? Anyone have advice for crowdfunding/ dealing with insurance problems? Also give ya boi emotional support pls im dyin [they/them]"	"I have top surgery and I personally kept my nips, but I have met two people who didn’t keep their nips, and I think it’s a cool option. I considered it, but I decided to keep mine because I was afraid I would miss my nips? If you don’t keep them, you can always get a chest tat or realistic nipples tatted on. There are tons of options, and I hope you figure out what suits you best. Good luck. 🙏🏽❤️

I think it’s probably a bit cheaper to not keep your nips, but I wouldn’t compromise cost for over all quality. Waiting is so rough, so I hope you are blessed with the resources you need.

I got top surgery a few weeks before my friend who did top surgery without nips, and they could take a shower quicker than me, but it wasn’t a big deal because I had a removable shower head. We both did a go fund me separately, and it worked out, but if you can ask people to give you cash, or somehow do a fundraiser for yourself, you will get to keep more of the funds, consider messaging people on social media and asking them, or ask for their address and send out a group letter with stamped envelopes inside for them to send checks or cash if you know enough people or have supportive family members. I got lucky an had some family and some Facebook friends donate and got my costs covered, but I did get charged $400 after unexpectedly because my insurance made a mistake. Save up a little extra if you have the patience and strength to wait for a safety net....
You can always check the ftm page but as far as I know many surgeons do the nipple graft for free and if they do charge is not that big of a difference. Also I don't think you heal faster, you just have an extra thing to heal and cover. My nipples didn't give me any trouble at all, keep them covered and that's about. Keep or remove the nipples cause you want to, you'll prob regret it you make the choice based off something else. Good luck saving up the money! 
My insurance didn't cover grafts, but my doctor offered to do them free of charge. After thinking on it, I decided not to get the grafts because I felt they'd end up looking too overtly masculine, and I'll be getting a chest piece done over the area anyway. I have heard of people who decided tti get grafts later down the line, though!"	aw2432	NonBinary	6	1.0	2019-03-01 07:32:06
AFAB NB - Seriously considering HRT?	"hi there! my name's V, i've identified as nonbinary for about 8 years now and my presentation has really gone all over the place, but something thats always been a bit of a constant is i feel i want some kind of HRT. 

thing is, i know very little about the whole subject, and im kind of a bit paranoid of googling all this stuff, i would love to know more from other nonbinary folk - how does 'low' or 'temporary' doses of HRT work? i'm not quite sure i understand, but it sounds like it might be ideal for me, to have low-dose T (or however it's referred to)? what happens when you stop? etc.

i want my voice to change, i want facial hair, i want my body in general to be more androgynous. while im fine with my boobs, i did use to bind them, so having less of them really isn't a concern to me. i don't fully understand bottom changes either but i don't think i'm terribly bothered by them. all i know is i really don't want to go FULL T, i want to be androgynous, not necessarily masc-passing, you know? but especially as of the last 6 months this urge to go on HRT has been getting to me, even triggering dysphoria i was previously fine with, so i wanted to come and ask on this reddit?

additionally, has anyone had experience with HRT within the UK? i am part of a LGBTQ+ group in my city, but i haven't had the courage to talk to a counsellor about it just yet, as i don't know exactly what it is i'm looking for. any advice at all would be really helpful, any anecdotes or even just explaining HRT to me like i'm 5 (jk.... or am i?)

for more context i am 20, turning 21 in april. while in the UK, our public healthcare is a bit of a mess right now, i am eligible for free prescriptions (under a HC2, a form of benefits), i'm not sure whether that would apply to HRT but i'm throwing it out there just incase. thank you for any responses, in advance!!"	"Low dose t is the same results as regular dose t, but they come on slower.  Temporary t is where you take t for a while and then stop, and the permanent effects (face and body hair, voice changes, bottom growth, possible hair loss) stay basically where they are when you stop taking them.  Other things, such as fat distribution (which changes your body shape) gradually revert back to where they were before you stopped taking them.  

A good gender clinic should be able to explain the details, and they're generally pretty happy to explain and let you take time to think it over. 

Definitely look up the results first, talk to a counselor, and take at least a little time to think it over, what you want, how confident you are that you'd want the permanent changes, how you'd feel about the various possible results (there's some individual variation, and unfortunately you can't pick the results you want) and how you'd deal with being perceived differently by people.  It can be the right choices for some people, but you want to understand what you'd be getting into.
Oh man, being in the UK is bad news for this stuff. If you're looking to see an NHS gender clinic the waiting lists are 3+ years to first appointment. The only other options are private which are very expensive (costs around £600 in appointments to get HRT, you can then usually get your prescriptions through NHS if your GP agrees to it). The system is super broken for us here.
thank you for the explanations on low-dose and temporary T, i appreciate it! i am generally very afraid of approaching the healthcare system with my gender stuff, as when i first came out back in 2012~ i got met with a lot of prejudice and even discrimination. while in all fairness, i WAS 13, it definitely did colour my expectations of receiving treatment and has kept me in a weird half-out half-not state. 

up until recently i didn't even realize HRT was even an option for a neutral/androgynous nonbinary person! i don't know if i just wasn't seeing it, or more folk like me are taking it now, but it just wasn't within my worldview for such a long time. so the idea of it is all very new to me - i used to identify as purely transmasculine and back then i DID want to take full T, but my feelings changed and i kind of tucked that whole thing away as ""something not for people like me"", and obviously that's not the case anymore. i will definitely do my research and atleast try with a gender clinic, and i may not even end up taking HRT now or even ever, but i definitely appreciate your advice and understanding. 

in general, the permanent effects (face/body hair, voice, bottom growth) are the main things i want, so temporary T might be right for me. (for a long time i was under the impression that you had to keep taking hormones indefinitely for *any* changes to stay, but that's obviously not true!)
yikes! In that case, OP should just dress more masculinely and get a short haircut (if not already done), iirc HRT is for those who WANT FULL changes BUT the OP is free to choose whatever is fitting to wants and needs; do not intend to change OP’s views.
Yeah, there's a lot of misapprehensions about what's possible.  Options for nonbinary people have expanded in the past few years, and a lot of what wasn't available not that long ago is available now.

It sounds like it's a close enough fit for what you want that it's worthwhile for you to do more research.  I know some nonbinary people do blogs where they discuss their experiences, and sometimes share results photos.
you're very right! i'm definitely going to look more into it and see if i can ask around in person before yeeting myself off to a gender clinic. i took a look through the ""hrt"" search on this very reddit and i'm so amazed at the difference it can make, i'm very happy it's become more of an option for us! thank you for your advice, i hope you have a great evening <3"	drtm2j	NonBinary	6	1.0	2019-11-05 03:41:03
Survey on the Experiences of Trans and Gender Diverse Folks When Accessing Dental/Oral Healthcare		"I'm a QTPOC dental student doing a survey to get more info on the experiences of folks in my community! Would love if anyone would be willing provide their input! It takes about 5 minutes and is totally anonymous.

This study is designed to better understand the experiences of gender diverse people with regard to oral health care. This is important because we cannot expect high-quality and equitable oral healthcare to be delivered if we are unaware of the various barriers to access and inclusivity that gender diverse individuals face. We need to hear about their experiences in trying to access care and understand how they feel about their interactions with their oral health care providers if we hope to make meaningful change. Therefore, if you identify as gender diverse, we would greatly appreciate your input!

The researchers for this project are Dr. Leslie Martin (she/her) (who can be reached at 951-785-2454 or lmartin@lasierra.edu), Dan Walker (they/them) (who can be reached at 661-477-0528 or dnwalker@uw.edu), and Sam Scott (she/her) (who can be reached at 909-528-9438 or ssco464@lasierra.edu) --if you have any questions that you would like to ask before you make a decision about participating, please reach out to one of them.

If you decide to participate you will be asked to complete a short survey (~5 minutes in length) asking about your satisfaction with your dental care, your fear of going to the dentist, your feelings about being stigmatized in the dental office, and some demographic information. All data are anonymous—you will not be asked to provide any personally-identifiable information and all responses will be analyzed as part of a large group of responses. You are free to skip any question that you don’t want to answer (although we hope you will choose to answer all the questions). You may also stop (withdraw from) the study at any time and there are no negative consequences for doing this. 

We do not anticipate that any of the questions will be particularly disturbing, but, if anything on the survey makes you feel you would like to talk with someone or get additional information, you are encouraged to reach out to an appropriate mental health professional. 

If you have questions or concerns about your rights as a participant you may contact Dr. In-Kyeong Kim (she/her), chair of La Sierra University’s Institutional Review Board at 951-785-2099 or irb@lasierra.edu. If you would like to receive a copy of the results of the study, once it is finished, please send an email to one of the researchers with this request. These email addresses will be saved and a copy of the data will be shared when the project is complete.

If you understand the information above and are willing to participate in this study, please continue to the survey link."	fc54vr	NonBinary	5	1.0	2020-03-02 02:29:12
Non-binary in corporate environment	"Okay so I've been struggling with the fact that I am working in a corporate environment. I love my job, it has taught me many things in the few months that I work there and my colleagues are amazing. I currently am presenting as my AGAB, which is somewhat fine since I'm not on HRT (yet). I love all the creative styles that most nonbinary folks here have, but this is not a style that suits me nor my ambitions. So I was hoping to hear more experiences of people in similar situations to mine, and get to know some enbies who are working and presenting themselves in a corporate environment. How do you all dress? And how are you still perceived as 'professional'? Are you out at work? And if so how does that work? 
For context I work as a consultant in the healthcare setting on governance level regarding IT questions and problems (yes very specific field). And I'm not a native English speaker so sorry if I'm somewhat blunt in my phrasing of this."	"I don't know how much help I will be but I can share my experience so far.

I work at home so all my interactions are zoom or in text.  I'm not 'out' as NB but I did put (He/They) in my email signature, work profile and my zoom name.  I've only been asked about it once and no one has used they/them, so they either haven't noticed or don't feel comfortable using something other than he/him.  I'm considering trying just they/them just to see what happens.

As far as appearance, I have painted nails and regularly wear some subtle makeup (thin eyeliner/mascara, natural eyeshadow colors, etc) and while not traditionally feminine tops, I have been using more colorful choices and such, but nothing really out there.  Bottoms I wear whatever but they don't see that lol.  Again no one has really called out anything about my appearance, either it's too subtle or they're not comfortable, but I probably won't go too overboard anyways.  I plan on getting a septum piercing, but that can just be flipped up on important meetings.
I also want to know! I'm just starting my career in social services and most people are kind about pronouns but there are still expectations about how employees should dress and express themselves socially.
This is something I can't decide how to play

I'm half out at work, my office friends know my gender and are really lovely and supportive, but I've never mentioned it to most of the office - partly because I never mention anything else either, I'm not the kind of person to share personal stuff/details about my home life with colleagues. And most of the time I'm fine with that, I'm a private person so I don't mind them not knowing, but some days I'm tempted to say something. 

For office clothes, we're generally pretty relaxed but I also have to go to a lot of conferences where I need to look more professional - I tend to try and sneak in little bits of me with bracelets, wristbands, subtle stuff that can be more masc or femme depending on how I'm feeling."	lmn0yh	NonBinary	6	1.0	2021-02-18 13:41:29
how do you navigate insurance when seeking gender affirming healthcare in the states?	"i’ve been going back and forth with united healthcare for nearly a year now and every phone call leaves me either in tears or in a heavily dissociative state 🥴

i’m just sick of the invalidation, the transphobia, and don’t even get me started on the hundreds of hoops i have to jump through... 

idk i just feel like giving up at this point. it feels like nobody is on my side."	"it depends on what you're talking about but generally an hrt doctor is just a doctor. your insurance doesn't need to know why you're going there. hrt in general is fairly inexpensive as far as medication goes. if you're talking about surgeries your best bet is going to be to call the doctor you want to work with and ask them questions. they're going to be much more affirming in the whole and have a monetary incentive to help you. 

you got this. it's going to be okay.
Ditto everything here. Getting HRT vs. Getting insurance to cover your HRT is a world of difference in difficulty.

I totally respect if a recurring medical cost is a bit much for you, but while I can't necessarily give you accurate numbers to medication cost, if you can get a perscription it likely won't be that hard to pay for yourself.

I got mine via Pushhealth online
yeah, im only trying to get access to hrt right now. and if it’s this hard for me now, i’m even more scared about how it will be when i have to get insurance approval for surgery. i’ve had really bad experiences with doctors in the past and this obviously hasn’t been helping with that...

for me, hrt would be at least $50 a month without insurance and i really can’t afford that kind of money. so i really need the authorization. and besides, the doctor i’m trying to set up an appointment with won’t even agree to scheduling an intake without insurance authorization- is this not normal?
no I don't think that's normal. I'd recommend checking out QMed. they do telemedicine and are super nice.
fuck... thank you for the resource + letting me know 😭 this whole process has really got me fucked up
yeah of course. I know it's frustrating. best of luck my friend"	mzdgl4	NonBinary	4	1.0	2021-04-27 01:33:54
Spanish Non-Binary Term	"I work at a healthcare non-profit and I’m updating our intake forms to be more inclusive. I’ve looked around on TikTok, google, and Reddit, but haven’t found anything conclusive. 
What is the Spanish spelling for “non-binary”? Is there another term we should be using? Thank you!"	"spanish is a gendered language so there’s two translations, a masculine one “no binario” and a feminine one “no binaria” (which is really dumb), for neutral we use the e instead of the o/a so it could be “no binarie” but a lot of people (transphobes) complain about it not being correct so there’s that too
Thank you! I appreciate you help. Transphobes can go cut themselves while slicing a lemon for all I care ;)

should i move out?? idk. i’m young but it’s too much	"UPDATE BELOW

should i move out?? my parents suck basically.

(posted this on r/Nonbinaryteens but posting here too cuz i need support. i hope that’s ok)

tw: transphob!a and emotional abu$e (i think i’d classify it as that?)

story: for almost a year after i came out, my parents were horribly transphobic and shitty. they’ve made a bit of progress but refuse to apologize for causing me harm and trauma (literally have flashbacks that i’m working on in therapy bc of it). they’re also super controlling and manipulative, and just overall really bad in most areas of parenting. ex, being overly strict, treating me like a baby while expecting me to act like an adult, being rly bad with finances to the point i’ve been crying and overly stressed abt money since i was like ten, yelling all the time, anger issues, secrecy, hypocrisy, etc. i also recently became disabled/chronically ill, and they’re incredibly ableist and make it so much worse even when i tell them what i need from them and that i need to see doctors and listen to my body. im also neurodivergent and they won’t even acknowledge it. so i want to move out. i kind of need to move out. but at the same time i feel kind of bad about it? or like i’m putting myself into a worse situation. advice? i have friends houses to stay at, and this would only be next year when i go to college.

important things to know: my parents are quite old, i have free healthcare in my country so don’t need to worry about that, the friends i mentioned have offered to house me long term, and what i think would be considered emotional abuse towards me and my siblings has been going on since my parents had kids. 

i really need help. i don’t know if this is the right thing to do or not. im scared out of my mind at the idea of staying here for another year though.

UPDATE: i have solid plans to move out soon, financial support as well as my own savings, a stable home with family friends (so basically a situation where in safe but my parents will still be slightly okay with it since they know them well), i’m likely moving at the end of this coming week!! wish me luck!!"	"Move out. There’s no reason to stay and you have offers from your friends already. You can do it; you are so much stronger than you realize. No one deserves to be uncomfortable or treated poorly in their own home.
I would try and focus on the things you can change and start making steps so that you can be confident to move out. Although yeah it does suck being home atm, you have to some extent think a bit more long term when it comes to stuff like school, work etc.

things like perhaps ensuring that having housing with friends can realistically happen and seeing if for that you need work or whatever are things you can look into now so that moving out can eventually happen. Like once you reach a point where your more confident about these sorts of arrangements actually making the leap and moving out would probably become alot easier.

i do want to add that at the end of the day, moving out is probably going to be your best option, just make sure you stay somewhat smart about it since its going to involve a higher degree of responsibility on your part.

Wish you the best of luck =)
Yes, just yes. You deserve to be treated better and with dignity, if you have somewhere safe to go to, do it. They might be your parents in a biological sense, but they sure don’t act like parents should. You matter, your well-being matters, surround yourself with people that support you and acknowledged your needs, even and especially the needs you don’t share with the average people! If someone wants to give you the feeling you or your needs matter less because you are not cis, chronically ill or neurodivergent, they don’t deserve the privilege of being part of your life. I had a partner who lowkey gaslight me about my mental health problems, and gave me the impression the rather unusual needs i have because of it aren’t valid and would prevent others from liking or loving me, separating from them was one of the most liberating things i have ever done! It is a big step and it needs courage, but your future you will thank you for doing it. Please give us an update how it is going and how you are doing. Take care and all the best!
that’s very smart, thank you for your advice. i’ll definitely think about it and make preparations/plans beforehand, so that it goes well and can actually happen without me being completely broke lol. thx again and have a nice day:)
thank you so much <3 i’ll definitely give an update at some point soon aha
UPDATE: i have solid plans to move out soon, financial support as well as my own savings, a stable home with family friends (so basically a situation where in safe but my parents will still be slightly okay with it since they know them well), i’m likely moving at the end of this coming week!! wish me luck!!

I'm worried about discussing gender with healthcare this far into my transition...	"So it took a *very* long time evolving to this point. I transitioned without nailing down a label, and just went with ""transfem and go""...that was all I could figure out. I let everyone draw their own conclusions, cuz ""fucked if I know"", lol. I told people I prefer she/her/they/them and just went with it. In many ways I wouldn't have transitioned at all if I forced myself to wait for a label. In my head I switched between questioning nonbinary and binary repeatedly over almost 2 years of transition but never really sorted it out until very recently...and turns out I'm an enby. As my friend said ""not choosing is paradoxically a choice"", lol. But by now, it doesn't really change a lot in the grand scheme of things....except one detail - I want a surgery to end with ""both parts"", and I have to ask for/about it from healthcare, but I loathe the conversation. I worry if I say ""nonbinary"" they will make assumptions or treat me differently (negatively I mean).... I am mainly fem aligned but what if they suddenly treat my HRT more ""neutral"" or something? The way I see it, I need to do the most fem HRT regimen just to end up in the middle where I'd be happiest. This feels like I'm invalidating myself because I struggled so long to assert my fem side but I don't want to neglect the rest of me either.... I have very specific goals. Sorry, just my thoughts....I know I *need* to have the conversation, I just don't *want* to have the conversation. I worry that I'll be stereotyped and that I can't go back from it."	"find an informed consent clinic and go from there. they are MUCH more knowledgeable about nonbinary transitions and will have better resources for you. ive seen many people keep their natal genitalia while getting a phalloplasty or such so it is definitely an option. you just need the right surgeon and care team.
Well, on paper, the doctor I'm going to is an ""informed consent"" type...but she's told me previously that she's inexperienced, so I doubt she's encountered what I'm going to ask for. I don't have access to anyone else due to it being a small city and I'm already going out of region. I think I'm mostly worried about being judged, but that's on me since I haven't given them the chance. I know the surgery is available, but I need to know if I can get it covered and where to go, and if they will even cover out of country.
honestly, if you need to lie to your doctors to get proper medical care, do so. i might get downvoted for this but you need to protect your ability to transition first and foremost. perhaps bring up nonbinary people as a conversation topic with her first to gauge her reaction before you tell her (if you plan on telling her)
I plan on telling her, assuming I can get the nerve up....only because the question is going to come up.... the ""why"" I would want that surgery, as it's not likely asked for much."	t26tn2	NonBinary	3	0.81	2022-02-26 20:54:07
Unsure about starting HRT	"Hi r/NonBinary! I’m AFAB transmasc nb and I’ve been tossing around the idea of going on T for awhile, but my personal pro and con list is pretty evenly split. Where I’m at currently in my gender is that while I’d like to present more masculine, I don’t want to necessarily be read as a cis-male. Just trying to be my peak nonbinary self. 

I’m currently working on getting a gender therapist and other trans healthcare providers to get more information, but in the meantime I was hoping to hear from other nb folks who have or haven’t started HRT and hear what factors led to your decision? I know everyone’s reasonings are different, and I just wanted to hear several people’s perspectives. Cheers! "	"I'm pretty sure I'm going to start t soon. For me my decision mainly boiled down to the fact that I couldn't stop thinking about it. Also my girlfriend started hormones in January and watching her go through those changes makes me insanely jealous. 

However, I definitely want to look very masc, so I haven't got too many cons to worry about. My main concern was not wanting to be mega hairy and feeling unsure about facial hair but those things are easy to deal with, so it was a pretty easy decision for me to make. But since I'm not sure if I'm nonbinary or ftm I'm still going to see a therapist first and start off very very slow.
Thankfully, HRT isn't just a yes or no. You can take smaller or larger doses, that will affect your body differently and at different rates. And while the changes your body goes through won't revert back if you stop taking hormones, you can stop at any time and your body won't continue to change any further. So there are options!
It's something you can talk to your healthcare provider about :)
I went through the list of changes and the ones that I felt could be a problem/cause additional dysphoria for me were facial hair growth, bottom growth, acne, and balding. 

I ended up going on T, and I'm glad I did. I choose gel just in case I changed my mind and wanted to stop immediately, but that seemed pretty unlikely.

My reasoning was that acne is temporary, facial hair can be shaved, and the chances of going bald when only going on T for a year are pretty slim. As for bottom growth, I considered it neutral with the possibility of actually being negative--I didn't have any genital dysphoria and didn't want to gain any. (But it turned out to be a very positive change for me, so you never really know.)

Doing a search for this topic in this sub can help. The question comes up a lot. 
Definitely agree. I used to think I didn’t want to, but it hasn’t left my mind at all these last few months so it’s really making me question where I want to go with my transition. Thanks!
I’ll definitely keep dosages in mind when I get a healthcare provider. Thanks!
Thank you for sharing! Glad your experience has been a positive one :)"	8ptbj4	NonBinary	4	1.0	2018-06-09 14:58:45
I no longer have time to body sculpt for euphoria, and it's awful	"I turned 30 last year and I'm a graduate student. Up until now I've been able to workout often enough to sculpt my body and keep myself looking androgynous. But with the stress and business of life, and a inevitably slowing metabolism, I know it can't last. It makes me so distressed every time I think about the possibility of the body dysphoria getting worse. I'm in clinical rotations for a healthcare profession, so I have to prioritize getting enough sleep, feeding myself well, and doing other things that bring me joy, I just don't have the time to workout as much as I used to.

Everyone's body changes, and I think it's possible that I might not feel any more or less dysphoric as I get older than I do now, but I can already see my body slowly changing. I currently live in a conservative region of the US and I don't get many opportunities to experience gender euphoria. Body sculpting was one of the few things I had. 

I don't think there's much that can be done for this. Whether it's now or 20 years from now, bodies change. I just needed to get this off my chest. When I try to tell my friends or family they just give me the side-eye and say something like ""I don't think you have anything to worry about"". They don't get that it's not about vanity, it's about gender alignment. It's a nice problem to have, I guess, that I had time to take such good care of myself in the first place. It's devastating to see myself losing something I worked so hard for though."		1266tf6	NonBinary	5	1.0	2023-03-30 01:07:08
Can you stop being non-binary by changing cultures?	"Lets make this example (It may be wrong from gender POV)  
You are AMAB who likes to use skincare product and gets lot of flak for it in his country and therefore you consider yourself non-binary.

Now you move to another country, where wording of healthcare product law allowed severeal skincare company use complex marketing strategy:""We don't sell some MLM crap, we sell approved products of preventive dermatology care."" and people ate it hook, line and sinker, so everyone uses skincare products.

Would you (after you naturalize) cease to be non-binary?"	"i think youre mixing up gender expression with gender identity. expression is the things an individual does, wears, their pronouns, etc. someone who does things unexpected for their gender is considered gender nonconforming, however that doesnt actually change the gender they are or make them nonbinary. we all understand that guys who wear makeup arent nonbinary or girls, for example. theyre just guys who like makeup. additionally, not all nonbinary individuals are androgynous and some look a lot like their assigned gender (ex. afab feminine folks and amab masculine folks). 

gender identity is what a person actually is. societal and cultural norms impact a lot of what gender is and what we associate with gender. expression is a way to show ones identity. however gender is more than just expression and involves a lot of internalized feelings based on the many societal and cultural expectations weve grown up with.

in this example, his use of skincare would cease to be gender nonconforming in a society that regards it as gender neutral. however he would continue to be nonbinary because thats an identity, not a set of actions or expressions. if he did come to the conclusion that he was nonbinary purely off of skincare then yes, i suppose he would cease to be nonbinary. however ive never actually seen that happen since gender is far more complex than that.
I guess it's possible, but I've never heard of someone gendering something like taking care of their skin to the point of considering themselves nonbinary because they do it. Everyone should be taking care of their skin honestly
Being non-binary has nothing to do with skincare and you can’t change your culture. But there are cultures where the standard is not on a gender binary, so there are no “non-binary” people because there’s no binary to begin with.
I think the thing here is the specific example. Some people may consider themselves non-binary based solely on the fact that they're gender non-conforming in their presentation: but based on my experience, that's not usually the sole and exclusive reason someone considers themself to be non-binary. I don't think that the majority of people who consider themselves to be non-binary do so because of one specific aspect of their presentation. 

That being said I think the response to moving into a different culture would depend on the individual and the two different cultures being involved, and pretty heavily on the individual in question.
When it comes to beauty products MLM means multilevel marketing, which is a type of a soft pyramid scheme (or at least it usually starts out ""soft"" so they're under the radar; eventually it ends up becoming a full blown pyramid scheme). Is that where you're getting confused with that exact line? If not, then I'm extremely confused by what you're trying to ask, and forgive me for that.
I am trying to convince myself that all NB people don't want to be different for the sake of being different to the level of swiming across river next to bridge and don't want to harrass other people with made-up words.

Non-binary people aren't very helpful.
Gender being fluid means that even if someone considers themselves nonbinary at one point and then decides that they're cis after all, there's nothing wrong with exploring their identity
not op but i can explain the question! in one country an amab person uses skincare which is considered 100% for women. he gets lots of flak for it and therefore considers himself nonbinary. he then moves to another country where skincare is considered for everyone of all genders. after getting accustomed to the new gender norms of that country does he cease to be nonbinary?

the mlm stuff isnt important to the question and is just an example for why skincare could be gender neutral in the second country.
before you say stuff like ""nonbinary people arent very helpful"" please keep in mind that lots of people replied to this post in the interest of helping you understand us better and that you are responding to a nonbinary person. most people are happy to talk to people about gender, provided questions are respectful, in good faith, and arent about extremely personal things.
Gotcha! I just thought maybe the OP thought in this context that MLM meant men loving men, and that's why they brought the question up. Your explanation makes complete sense. 

They definitely wouldn't cease to be non-binary if the culture has a binary gender setup in any way, shape or form. Even if a culture accepts more than two genders, an enby would still be an enby IMO (the only thing I could think that would change are cultures where there is no gender at all, and that's still a maybe because you were still raised in a different culture and based your identity on what you learned in your born-to culture)."	ewvf96	NonBinary	5	0.78	2020-01-31 21:37:12
What are issues you encounter with healthcare?		"So most answers will probably be about transition related care, but I have a different concern:

I haven't had a primary care physician in over 6 years because I struggle to find a doctor who isn't transphobic. The best I can do is find people who list themselves as treating ""lgbt"" patients, but have no idea about trans people. If I'm in the vulnerable position of seeking medical care, I dont want to be educating my provider.

Zombie name?	"So obviously this could just go on traaaaa, but I'm NB so I'm venting here. Fuck having a dead name that literally everyone you know, knows. And that you haven't had the money to kill properly.

I realised today that I booked a doctor's appointment (unrelated to trans care) with a clinic under my name, but my healthcare information, and ID all has my deadname on it, and now I'm worried that's going to be an issue, and I just wish I didn't have to worry about it."	"Nope. At least, not here in UK 

You're absolutely allowed to go by a chosen name that's different to what's on your legal documents. You could just explain that to the clinic and they'll probably understand :) they will probably have to use the deadname for the insurance purposes, but for addressing you they should use whatever you're comfortable with 

Think of it like a nickname. Your name could be William but no one bats an eyelid if you prefer Billy. The legal name is just for legal purposes, because you can't not have a name

As long as you can prove you're you (photo ID usually, or buttload of various paperwork with your name/s on it, and a birth certificate for example) then name doesn't matter. 

You can even write up your own deed poll and have someone witness it (again, here. I don't know if other countries are the same) which counts. You only need it legalised for certain official things. But most organisations should accept your own one you've drawn up. It's just a document to declare ""this is my name now"""	p91znc	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-08-21 23:51:00
some of my experiences	"I've never felt like my AGAB and the last year or so has been one in which I have discovered my true self. I'm an enby. I changed my name (socially) to something more androgynous and I feel so much happier not feeling like I have to conform to any behaviours or stereotypes. I have been trying to focus on just being me. However, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows. While I feel content as myself, I can't open up to my parents due to their religious background. I don't think that they would understand and I'm afraid my parents would badtalk my psychologist (overall, I just don't think that my mental health could take it). This extends to work as I am afraid of how the school I work at would respond. 

I have also found that some people are very rude when I've told them. One person asked if they could have an exception to call me by my deadname and then also said that they didn't think it was possible for them to see me any differently. I'll grant that they were high, but it was still hurtful as my experience with being high tells me that people are more honest. 

Another thing that happened earlier this year was when a close friend of mine and I met some new people and they asked what our names and pronouns were. I was stoked! This was one of the first times people had made the effort to ask! But my friend then proceeded to seem bemused and made a pronoun joke saying that they were ""Yass/Queen"". It was a bit hurtful because they brought this up recently and said how strange it was to be asked that and how weird those people were being. Yeah... I explained why it was hurtful as best as I could. I think they understood but they never apologised and I feel like they think I'm being overly sensitive. But I don't think it's sensitive to want to be referred to properly.

I was also shocked when my psych lecturer had a class debate about trans healthcare. Only a fraction of the class believed that hormone blockers should be given to children. They seemed to think that surgery is currently being done to minors simply because they ask for it. I feel for our brethren who need surgery. People are so ill-informed.

I must mention that I do have some amazing online friends who have helped me with all of my struggles. Shoutout to them for understanding me and seeing me for the wonderful and weird person I am. <3

You're probably wondering what the purpose of this wall of text is. I wrote this because I'm just really emotional right now. I feel like many of the people around me view me as lesser or a freak. This could be paranoia but I'm definitely feeling down.

If any of you have any advice for dealing with misgendering and general lgbt+-phobia I would love to hear it. I feel so misunderstood. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Life as the 'real' me is both beautiful and challenging. People aren't nice. I would love any advice<3"	"People suck. And don’t get it. And it hurts. The only thing you can do is convey that it’s hurtful and if people don’t care that it is, they don’t get to be in your life. You can also pick your battles. There are some spaces where I know people are going to suck but I have other reasons for being in those spaces so I just accept misgendering while reminding myself I know who I am. Big enby hugs.
I appreciate the hugs greatly <3

Going for chest reduction over top surgery thoughts?	"I got a call for top surgery referral way faster than expected and I'm not out to my parents still, despite living with them lmao. 

But the issue right now is I'm still on the fence about whether I want a reduction or full removal, even after being 3 months on T. I have about a year to figure this out and get surgery and have it be covered by healthcare due to specific circumstances involving me moving out of country. I don't want to rush and make the wrong decision but I want this to be done while I can be in a position to recover at home and not be charged out the ass. 

I hate being topless as my body currently is, but I don't always necessarily hate if my chest is just... smaller, like compressed in a sports bra. Often I want to completely bind, but not 100% of the time, if that makes sense.

I've given up on trying to force specific labels to fit myself because nothing does. I'm probably some form of fluid or flux with a general lean to masc but I don't really know. 

Does anyone else have any experience with this situation? I'm in Canada so it would be covered but I won't be able to see my doctor for a few weeks to discuss if reduction is even an option for trans folx that would be covered, or what.

Thanks."	"Hello friends, I too am on board your reduce vs remove -boat I think haha. 

I am a bit late to the game, in my late 20s, but have been deeply bothered and weighed down (quite literally) by breasts since I was about 13. I am also in Canada (yay) and have just booked in to see my GP two weeks from now. I have been dreaming of a breast reduction/removal for about 10 years now and did not realize until last night that it might actually be covered by MSP?!

At first the thought of a breast reduction was purely physically practical-I am a size H, I have back/neck pain and could easily lose an eye doing a jump-squat, but over the last 2 years I've grown an awareness of gender and am pretty confused about where I sit... I was AFAB but pretty well disagree with the gender binary as it stands and I definitely enjoy expressing masq and am most likely somewhere in the NB spectrum as well.

From a physical perspective, sure, the reduction seems like it would serve my needs, but in terms of gender and aligning my outside with my inside, I'm really not sure...

Do you know if you/we/folks in Canada could have a reduction and then later have a full removal and still have both procedures covered?

Not sure if you've already made up your mind, or if you've even already had your surgery but I hope it went (or goes) well and look forward to hearing about it (as someone possibly at the very start of this process)! much love!"	sdfkya	NonBinary	3	1.0	2022-01-26 20:29:36
Binding with back pain?	"Is this something to be concerned about? My binder is on its way woot! I’m a bit nervous to ask my doctor about this. I am completely judging him with no basis for it and definitely being ageist, but he is in his 60s and I’m worried he won’t really be understanding or open about binding. 

I have PT with a new person tomorrow, so if I like their vibe, I could ask them. It’s just nerve wracking. Unfortunately I have a mystery condition - maybe a musculoskeletal issue? Maybe psoriatic arthritis? I have developed mild scoliosis due to whatever is going on but no one is sure exactly what that might be.

I know no one can give medical advice but I’m curious if anyone has experience with this. Or if you have tips for approaching this with my healthcare team? I really just want to have a flatter chest and am worried my flipping hip and back will ruin that.

Thanks for any advice!"		g9bv65	NonBinary	4	0.83	2020-04-27 23:21:39
Advice and help requested..?	"Vent followed by please help:

I'm trying to get my chest removed completely. Simple as that. I've wanted this since I was 15, before I even knew what trans/NB were, and before I'd even considered I might be trans/NB. 

""Valid"" reasons other than MY BODY MY CHOICE:

1) They're heavy, and a strong contributed to my scholiosis (two 30°+ curves in my spine). For reference, I'm a 28I/J. I'm also 5'4 and 120lbs. This is a large chest for a small frame. Doesn't feel good. 

2) I can't breathe properly without an outside force (pillow, desk, etc) holding up my chest and taking the strain off my body. 

3) General neck/back pain. 

4) Cancer concerns (runs in the family, mostly in large breasted afab people, and a doctor, when doing a check up, informed me i either have large cysts or cancer, and never further explored that with me).

Also, not valid in the eyes of America in any way thus far for me, but IM TRANS/NB. Top makes unhappy. 

I'm a broke person making scraps, can't afford bills, no health insurance, can't work more hours cause I'll be bed ridden in pain, can't work less hours cause the few bills I can afford NEED to be paid. 


QUESTION:


Would anyone with more experience be able to help me in finding an affordable way to get top surgery? I keep doing research, but it just keeps bringing me back to ""expensive"" and ""very bad reviews (especially for LGBT peeps)"". 

I'm TRYING to get insurance through my job, it requires more hours though, which Im struggling to do due to pain, and I was denied state healthcare because ""you make too much"" (I make ~800-1k/mo working more hours than I physically can without pain).

Texas resident if that is of any help."	I wish I could say there's a way to get get it done but the healthcare system (and every other system) in this country is trash. Your best bet is probably gonna be to find a better job with decent insurance. I know it sucks and it's much easier said than done (I've been waiting for 20 years). With all your physical issues, you'd probably only have to pay the deductible and you could most likely get it  done for the medically necessary reasons (possibly fewer hoops to jump through although Texas might cause a problem because Texas). I'm getting mine done through the target insurance and it's very good. They don't pay great and it *is* retail but they do offer insurance to part time workers as well.

In or near Surrey, UK? There's a new trans/nonbinary support group for you!	"  [https://surreytransgendersupport.com/](https://surreytransgendersupport.com/) 

This is a new support group set up by trans people, FOR trans people. It's focused on helping people of all identities and at ANY stage in their transition out with emotional support, providing a judgment-free place to talk about your struggles, and a way to connect with other trans people in your area. It's casual, and has the benefit of having 2 nurses attend who have experience working in trans healthcare/transitioning - both of whom have trans children and are FULLY supportive of all expressions and identities.  Talk about everything from dysphoria, to relationship issues, to transitioning struggles or fears about presenting yourself, to celebrations and support for positive steps. This place is the opposite of gatekeeping when it comes to transition, expression or identity.

It's on the last Saturday of every month, from 6pm to 10pm. The address is:

**Therapy Gardens**  
**Manor Fruit Farm**  
**Normandy**  
**Guildford GU3 2DT**

The next 3 groups are Saturday 29th of February, followed by the 28th of March and then the 25th of April.

If you have any questions about the group, ask me!"	If you haven’t already, you should definitely crosspost this to r/transgenderuk :) I don’t live near Surrey, alas, but this is still encouraging to see ✨	eu5nvk	NonBinary	3	1.0	2020-01-26 11:37:42

Just misgendered myself at work and need a better way of approaching the 'boy/girl' question with kids at work?	"Just misgendered myself at work.

For context, I work in a healthcare setting (dental) with kids as our patient base, where we often see them for appointments without their parents. 

Earlier today I went to bring a patient (about 9 years old) through for her apppointment, and she asked me 'are you a boy or a girl?' I thought about telling her that I'm not either, but I ended up saying 'I'm a girl' out of convenience (and the fact that I'm not out at work) and now I feel awful about misgendering myself. When I asked why they weren't sure they said 'you have hair like a boy' (my hair is pretty short). My cis male colleague who I work with also got asked the same question and was equally confused by it, and after she asked him I said 'I got the same question, don't worry'. We talked about it afterwards, but relaying the conversation she and I had made me feel yuck (as I had to misgender myself a second time). 

Tbh I'm not so much upset about her not being sure whether I was a boy or a girl, but I wasn't happy about having to either misgender or out myself. In hindsight I should have just told her I was an alien or something lol, but it does have me thinking about how to navigate that question with kids who are particularly young/curious (especially as I prefer to present as androgynous as I can). Does anyone else who works with kids have any advice on this front? I know being out at work will play a big part in what I can respond with, but for those of you who are somewhat closeted and work with kids - what do you say when kids ask these sorts of questions?"	"I haven't gotten these questions yet, but if you're out, be upfront with them. Kids appreciate honesty. Just use kid friendly language and answer ONLY the question asked. For example, ""Well, I'm a bit of both,' ""I don't feel like either,"" or ""sometimes I feel like a girl and sometimes I feel like a boy."" And if you're uncomfortable answering a question, you can just tell them, ""That's pretty personal, and I'd like to keep that to myself. But I'm so happy you're curious!"" 

If you're not out, then you'll have to reconcile your reasons for not doing so so you can be okay with misgendering yourself. I'm not 100% out at work, just because I find it awkward to bring up. So I do cringe when I get call Ms. and ""lady"".
You don't have to explain yourself to anyone. 

An easy way to change the akward question... 
Is to answer a question with a question. 

When a kid asks you about your gender. Ask about their's instead. Or ask if they have a pet and if the pet is a boy or a girl.

I have an 11-year-old who identities as non-binary. They also get asked if they're a boy or a girl. They shrug at the person. And ask the same question back. Most kids understand more than we think they do... 

But if you feel uncomfortable explaining non-binary to someone, don't do it."	qh9dbq	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-10-27 23:22:01
Birth control + chest size issue?	"Hi All, 

I'm AFAB and about six months ago my cycle changed (likely just due to getting older) and now I'm feeling and seeing my hormonal fluctuations every month a lot. I used to be a small A all the time, now I swell up to nearly a C a week or two per month and that causes me lots of dysphoria. 

Having a pretty small chest is important to me - I really liked that I could essentially get myself flat with a sports bra instead of a binder, plus the mood swings really suck. But I'm worried that the only thing that would stabilize the hormonal fluctuations - birth control - would just create even more swelling. How have other folks dealt with this? Has a progesterone only pill helped at all? Have you found any other solutions, aside from top surgery? 

(I'm 32 and have access to good healthcare options because I'm in NYC, but surgery isn't in the cards for several years, probably)

Thanks!!"	"hi! i’m a 21 y/o non-binary person on an extended cycle pill. i’m on a generic seasonique called simpese, and the only type of swelling i experience near my cycle is actually bloating around my stomach starting about a month out. the only other adverse effect i’ve experienced is i can spot randomly, which can be made worse by sexual activity of any kind (uterine lining being made thinner by BC = more likely to shed when uterine muscles contract during orgasm). not having an actual period every month is so nice though, so imo the trade was worth it.
im interested as well. ive only been taking birth control for two weeks and my partner said that my chest got bigger which got me worried."	j88f3j	NonBinary	3	1.0	2020-10-09 22:05:09
Having a hard time dealing with jealousy of friends who get top surgery before I do	"A friend of mine is likely going to be able to get a medically-necessary breast reduction, and even though I'm happy for them for getting something that will help the quality of her life, I'm also frustrated at myself and jealous of her for being able to do this before I even get to start binding, or go on testosterone, or do *anything* related to medical transition when I've been wanting it for 5+ years. The friend knows I'm trans and is lovely and super supportive of me and I don't have any issues with them at all, but I don't want to make them feel bad for getting something they need because of my own circumstances. 

I live at home and the pandemic means at least one, if not both of my parents are also home 24/7, so I can't do telehealth stuff or even shop around for a new PCP because I don't trust my current one. I also don't have insurance of my own once I graduate university so I'd either have to pay out of pocket for everything or risk getting outed through my parent's insurance. I'd have to hide physical changes from testosterone from my parents until I'm able to move out, but I've never been able to hold a job above minimum wage and I can't handle working those sorts of jobs for longer than 2-3 months at a time -- gotta love being an unemployable lazy mentally ill art student! Add the insane trans healthcare-related waitlists and COVID-related delays on top of that and I can't fathom being able to get on testosterone within 4-5 years from now, much less getting top surgery. 

I don't even know. I'm just upset and frustrated and needed to vent somewhere. I don't have any IRL trans friends I can turn to in order to help me with these feelings. I can cope with dysphoria most days and I even like my body sometimes, but when I'm reminded of what I don't get to have (yet) it's hard."	"It sucks, and sometimes you just have no idea where to put those feelings. I know someone who is trans, who like, was starting to contemplate transitioning a year ago. Now I get messages in a group chat that they're annoyed b/c a pharmacy screw up means they've been off meds for a few days.

And that sucks, I get it. But I was on the waiting list for 4 years, got seen then discharged onto *another* waiting list, this time for counselling I don't need, for which the waiting list is *another year*. I need to do the therapy, wait for a space to open back up at the gender clinic, and then it'll probably be another year *again* before I can get hormones.

All because I'm looking for T (controlled), and this person was looking for E (not controlled so they just bought it basically).

So it's hard for me whenever this person is posting their struggles with their meds, b/c I want to provide solidarity and sympathy, but at the same time, it really really punches my own feelings in the gut when they talk about it.

So, you have my sympathy on this. It's a sucky thing to be going through, it's really hard to maintain that support of someone who has done nothing wrong! while needing that support yourself due to what their situation raises inside of you.
I definitely feel this, yeah. I just remind myself that what I SHOULD be mad at are the various systems keeping me stuck at home in an environment where I don't know if I can be safe due to financial and transphobic pressures -- but its harder to direct my angst at a vague collection of Things as opposed to a person :P"	s76ezl	NonBinary	3	0.72	2022-01-18 20:03:04
Being nonbinary and working in healthcare	"Hi all,

I’m going to be starting my clinicals soon and wanted to get any advice for working in a hospital setting as a nonbinary person. I’m anxious about correcting people on my pronouns because I don’t want to seem disrespectful to my superiors as a student. 

I’m going into surgical technology which I’m so passionate and excited about and would love to hear any other people’s experiences working in any facet of the healthcare."	"Heeeey, congrats on clinicals!!!

My answer is: it depends on which system and hospital, it's all down to individual culture. I work for a larger academic system and we have a good DEI office with different diversity community groups and our policy explicitly protects sexual and gender identities, even if the states we're in don't. I actually came out at work before I did to my family because I felt safe enough to do so. However, even in my system other folks may not be out because of the local culture. 

I would say being out about your pronouns would be a good litmus test to see if where you're planning to work has a good culture fit in the long term. Setting healthy boundaries about your identity is not being disrespectful. Trust is a really important foundation in health care, and speaking up about issues (""safe to speak"") is high priority right now.
I'm assuming you would have a name tag, right? If so, could you pronouns be added to that or add a pin that has your pronouns? I got a they/them pronoun pin to add to my lanyard at work and it has helped some people to remember.
I’ll be able to wear it outside the OR but most of the time I’m gonna be scrubbed and gowned. I have one currently that I’ve had some success with with classmates, thank you!"	10qzuqg	NonBinary	3	1.0	2023-02-01 17:05:14
Top surgery consult	"Got top surgery consult by a ‘good top surgery surgeon’. He misgendered me in the consult even tho my fucking chart even says they/them/theirs.

My wife almost punched him. ❤️❤️"	"no one ever reads the fucking charts. absolutely fucking nobody. 

 It's frustrating that you have to deal with someone so thoughtless, especially when they're supposed to have a good reputation.

Should I go for HRT?	Hello, I'm non-binary (he/she/them) afab and have been out to myself for about a year. I have some dysphoria and I'd like a top surgery at some point, but right now I'm mostly thinking about low-dosing T for a year to see how it goes (kinda afraid i'll end up being a full-on transman in denial??). The thing is that I'm pretty young (turning 18 this year) and I have to live with my parents. I also live in a country where I can't get any gender-affirming healthcare and I have to rely on DIY-ing. So, with all of that, I'd love to hear from someone with more experience, what do you think? Is it safe for me to try HRT? (I'd really love to tho, that dysphoria has been harsh on me lately) And if I do, is there any way to sneak it past my parents or will they notice the change?	"There is no safe way to DIY testosterone. What might be a safe and effective dose for one person could lead to deadly complications in another. Results desirable for one person may not be desirable for another. Every individual has different goals, and every body will react differently to medication. Without a doctor to keep track of things and getting regular lab work, trying to DIY HRT can kill you. I know that's not the answer you were hoping for, but it's the unfortunate reality of current medical science.

Also, the effects of testosterone are pretty noticeable even at lower doses, so hiding it from your parents may be tricky depending on circumstances."	mx5xs5	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-04-23 21:48:13
A set back in physical transition (afab non-binary)	"First time posting here, everybody seems super nice and supportive so decided to give it a go. Sorry for the long post. Also English isn't my first language. TLDR in the bottom.

Some backround: I'm 25 nb (they/them), living in Finland. The trans healthcare here isn't as good as one could hope(compared to the US or UK for example). In addition to the common stuff like long waitinglists and jumping through million hoops in hopes of a diagnosis and gender conforming treatments there's stuff like having to prove you're infertile to change your legal gender marker and there only being two gender clinics in the whole country(You also cant go private if you want hrt for reasons I wont bore you with). The government is working on a new ''trans law'', but it won't cover a whole lot of stuff that the experts and community hoped for like the rights of underage trans people. In addition to the binary trans people's struggles there's the non- binary folk who are fighting for their even worse conditions. For example there was a ban on nb treatments a year ago, which was luckily resolved after a lot of backlash.

One of the worries trans people looking for treatment here is not being able to be honest about your mental health because the clinics are known for stalling the diagnostic progress or putting people on ''time outs'' to sort their mental health issues. I do realize this is a responsible and good thing in some cases but when it gets to the point of people not being honest about their health to get what they want I feel like something is wrong. A big part of the diagnostic progress is ruling out any mental illnesses or symptoms that might be affecting the patients view of their gender indentity (psychosis, personality disorders etc.) and those might be missed if the patient is not being truthful and avoiding ''getting caught''. Also for some people one of the biggest contributing factors to their mental health issues is the reason they're there to get treatment i.e. gender dysphoria.

Anyways, against all the advice from a support group I go to, I decided to be honest about my mental health which honestly could be better(depression and anxiety), but I've made a lot of progress. I go to therapy and a support group and see my gp regularly. Mental health issues were one of the reasons I didn't seek treatment earlier. I wanted to feel like I was ready and could handle the stuff and that's what I've been feeling like lately. Therapist and gp both feel like I've come a long way and that I'm well and stable enough to go through the process. I have the most supportive partner and I recently came out to my mom who has also been great.

I've been in the diagnostic process for a little over a year now and gone through all the tests. All that remains between me and the treatment I need, is a phone call appointment with the psychologist where they are going to either recommend that I get the treatment or a ''time out'' and a meeting with the clinic doctor to either get the diagnosis and treatment or to figure out stuff to get to the point they would go with the first option.

Today I had the call appointment. I was told that while my gender identity ''seems legit'' and they weren't able to find anything negative that could affect it, they weren't going to recommend for me to receive treatment for the time being. And oh yes, you guessed it! The reason for this is that they were concerned about my mental well- being. There's still a slight chance that the doctor will disagree with the psychologist and I will get what I need, but I'm not too happy about the odds. I'm gutted and anxious and don't know how to feel.

TLDR: Been in the process of getting a diagnosis and treatment for gender dysphoria for over a year. Trans clinic psychologist recommended that I should not get treatment as of now because of a concern about mental well- being. Me, my therapist and my gp feel like this wasn't the right decision. Going private isn't an option because of legal gate keeping concerning hrt in my country. Feeling shitty.

Any advice or comments are welcome!

edit. used the wrong term"	"Is there any other therapist that you could go to that might disagree with original doc?
Seems like a messed up process TBH sorry you have to go through this
Ugh, I am sorry.
It's the clinic's own psychologist so there's no way of getting a second opinion. My only hope is that the doc disagrees with the psychologist's recommendation and I don't think that's going to happen.
The doc, an therapist  being in the same place!
That is super gatekeeping WTF and they probably discuss cases with each other! 
The worst of it is if they deny you,  your happiness  is going to go down and then they will hold that over you. You could try and ask a second opinion on the therapists ruling, not sure if you have that option but it is worth a try.
Best of luck to you
Yeah, the whole diagnostics process is done in the clinic and all of the people that do the assesments work together. I dont think I can ask for a second opinion and even if I did, it would take another three appointments that take 6 months to complete. So it would be the same as getting a 6 month time out plus having to go through the assesments again.

Microdosing Testosterone	Hello folks! Curious if any nb folks on T have lowered their testosterone dose to a microdose & if so, I'm curious how their body reacted to the change. I've been on testosterone for almost two months and have been taking about 60mg per week via injection. I'm liking the changes but also am feeling a bit overwhelmed and am thinking I'd prefer to slow things down. I have endometriosis & very painful periods so am worried about what a drop in T could do to my hormones and to my period in particular. My healthcare providers haven't been able to give me the answers that I'm looking for.		k0b1ga	NonBinary	2	1.0	2020-11-24 18:47:33
‘Women’s Health’	"Good Morning, Reddit!

Just needed to vent about something that really bothered me this morning. I am an AFAB person and have used an IUD for the last 5 years now. At the time, I did not have insurance, but since I live in WA, the visit was completely free thru Planned Parenthood. Additionally, though I couldn’t speak to their ability to provide care to trans &non-binary people as I was still identifying as a woman at the time, my doctors and staff were extremely friendly and welcoming. I had a really positive experience. 

Fast forward to today when I realize that it’s time to have my IUD replaced. So I scheduled my appointment online with the same PP clinic I had my current one placed at. Haven’t had my legal name changed which always sucks (my insurance provider’s member services apparently requires their employees to call you ma’am at every opportunity despite the many times I’ve asked to make a note not to), but PP asks for your chosen name as well as your pronouns and has adaptive nearly all of their verbiage to be more respectful of trans and non-binary people who need to access gynecological services. However, once I got to my appointment, reception informed me that my insurance (which is a catastrophic plan that runs nearly $300 a month) basically bans people from seeing other providers even though they provide the crappiest services. Don’t even get me started on their mental health department... I would have had to pay $500 out of pocket to have my IUD replaced. Shoutout to the front desk employees who went OUT OF THEIR WAY to see if there were any loopholes/ways around the system for me. Planned parenthood: 10/10 

So now I have to make an appointment w/my health insurance provider’s office. 

1. You cannot schedule an appointment online. To see a ‘specialist’ which a gynecologist is, you have to call your primary physician to get a referral and then you can call the ‘Women’s Health Department’ to schedule your appointment. 

2. Under list of specialties, rather than ‘Sexual Health specialties’ or ‘gynecological specialties’ or ‘obstetrics specialties’ they continue to use ‘Women’s Health.’ It is extremely frustrating that I am prohibited from seeing doctor’s/using a facility that validates my identity to be met with a system that is actively dysphoric. A company that hasn’t even attempted to change their verbiage surely can’t be making any attempts to train and ensure their employees and physicians are respectful and knowledgeable of trans and non-binary identities. 

3. Women’s Health directs you to Sexual Health which THEN directs you to Transgender, Lesbian, and Bisexual Health... 
They have a really nice, flowery FAQ on transgender identities and why it’s important to manage your stress and how to support loved ones who are transgendered. They mention “non-binary” exactly once and out it in quotes like it’s not “not really real.” 

But if they know that it’s important to validate and respect trans people... why do they call the department “women’s health” seemingly knowing full well that we aren’t women. Why, when by Women’s Health they usually mean AFAB Health, are they including trans women? Also, I’m sure some may disagree with me (and I’d love to hear your opinions), but I don’t appreciate healthcare lumping gender identities and sexual identities together. I think cis/het people often conflate the two in problematic ways that can be invalidating (I had a coworker who couldn’t wrap his mind around that fact that his straight cis male friend was still straight “even though his girlfriend is {trans}” (he didn’t use ‘trans’) 

3. In addition to the $300/month premium, the visit will cost $200. So, all in all, I get to pay $500 to access dysphoria-inducing care when I could’ve paid $0 had I not had insurance at all. Thanks, America. 

Anyway, thanks for reading this rant. I hope you’re all staying safe out there!"		gzr8wc	NonBinary	2	1.0	2020-06-09 17:06:10
Nonbinary and Transgender experiences in healthcare professions	"Hey dudes, here is a cool study by Dimant et al., (2019) I just read about the experiences of transgender and nonbinary medical students, residents, and physicians. The fear of facing discrimination in medical school / postgraduate programs is one of the biggest reasons I'm afraid of not formally being out. :(

UK based healthcare advice	"Looking for advice from any UK-based enbies out there. I want to be referred to a gender clinic and as far as I can work out I need to be referred by my GP. 

Now if I could see my usual GP I think I'd feel relatively safe but my GP surgery are hugely struggling at the moment and both the regular GPs are off sick, they're using locum doctors so it's completely random who you'll see on the day. My worry is if I end up speaking to a GP whose personal or cultural beliefs mean they're not okay with anything outside the gender binary can they refuse to treat me? I think I would die a bit inside if that happens.

I'm feeling really dysphoric lately and being refused care might be really damaging for me mental health wise. Do I suck it up and go and see a mystery GP or try and hang on until a nebulous future date when one of the GPs I trust is back?

Thanks for your time reading this 💛🤍💜🖤"	"So, funnily enough, I watched the PhilosphyTube video on just this thing a few weeks back. Whilst Abigail (of PhilosphyTube) is a binary trans woman, this still applies to us enbys. She talked about having this experience a few times in a row with the same GP ""forgetting"" to send her referral letter to the local GIC. She moved before it was ever resolved and, when she went to see her new local GP, she brought along the NHS guidelines on treating trans patients and highlighting the relevant section on referring patients to their nearest GIC. She doesn't show the document in the video, but I think I might have found what she was talking about:

[https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/transhealth/documents/gender-dysphoria-guide-for-gps-and-other-health-care-staff.pdf](https://www.nhs.uk/livewell/transhealth/documents/gender-dysphoria-guide-for-gps-and-other-health-care-staff.pdf)

I've only skimmed the first 4-5 pages, but all of it looks like it could scare the GP into sending you to your nearest GIC. I would suggest printing all of it out (or at least the relevant pages, but don't cut anything out) and taking it with you. When I talked to my GP about being referred, I wasn't really familiar with them, but they still did what I asked and sent a referral. According to some research Abigail showed from 2021, just over 1 in 10 trans people reported being refused medical help from their GPs, so the numbers are in your favour for being helped. All the same, having the document on you ready to show to whatever clown you might face could be something of a lifesaver.

Sorry that this was so long, but I wanted to be thorough (and I never know when to shut up!) Sending luck and love your way ❤
Thank you! That is so helpful, I'll have a look for that video but thanks so much for finding the document. You are an absolute angel!"	106053r	NonBinary	2	1.0	2023-01-07 21:25:17
PMDD Pre-Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder as gender dysphoria?	"Hey enbies. 💖

I came out as non-binary almost a decade ago, and I’m finally buckling down for top-surgery stuff. I’m in consultation to get a letter of support, and in my intake I was asked about how my mental and physical health struggles present. It brought up questions about PMDD I wanted to check in and see what others here know.

I have realized I have extreme responses to what others sometimes experience as PMS. My body was assigned female at birth and as far as I know I’m XX chromosomally. Around age 25 l realized that all of my historic serious self harm attempts since age 13 have occurred in the days before I menstruate. It has not been a conscious association. Regardless of if I’m tracking my cycle or not I just become completely overcome with doom and a desire to not exist. Almost as soon as I start bleeding (sometime beginning in the couple of hours before) I feel the emotional burden lift. I can deal with menstrual blood fine, but it’s the brain/presumably the hormonal shift that makes me absolutely lose my mind.

I’m curious if this is an expression of transness? I guess I’ve never really considered the two as related, but when a healthcare professional asked me how gender dysphoria shows up for me, I thought to ask.

So your turn to share perspectives… does my experience with PMDD sound like it could be related to transness? Where can I learn more about this? Who’s having this conversation?"	"TW:ED  
Hello, not exactly an answer to your question regarding transness, but I can share what might be a tenuously-related PMDD experience.  I have struggled with an eating disorder and the desire to be unsettelingly thin and shapeless, despite my curvy nature, since the dawn of puberty (17 years of noticing this pattern now).  My perception of my body gets majorly warped when PMDD'ing out.  I also want to crawl into traffic or into a little hole to die alone, but the perceptual distortions of my body has solidified as an ""uh oh this is actually really not normal"" thing over the last few years as I have grown into an objectively successful, well-educated ourwardly confident and vivacious adult.  I am reminded of Cardi B's iconic quote, ""LET ME FAT IN PEACE"".  Also I am, and will probably always be, in therapy. I know the way I think about my body is not healthy not only while in the depths of PMDD and have all kinds of trauma to forever unpack about my body, autonomy, and beauty standards.  
Anyway, I stopped menstruating about 5 years ago when I had an IUD installed to control hormonal migraines then got the Nexplanon arm implant this past spring with a similar positive response.  My predicament is that I don't get the emotional release and obvious confirmation from bleeding.  Instead I am passively suicidal, have no libido, and see and believe myself to be the most disgusting human in the world for about two weeks of the month.  It feels very insidious and sneaks up on me every time usually after the worst is over.  Some months I don't have so much stress and am not as negatively affected, but a few times a year I get absolutely decimated by crushing despair, disgust, hopelessness and anxiety and one way I can control that is by not eating.
Thanks for sharing your experience. Mine’s very similar, including ongoing eating disorder stuff. Are you non-binary?"	qqbd8f	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-11-09 19:34:11
Partial Transitioning	I was wondering if anyone here has had any experience with partial transitioning with hrt, surgeries, etc.? What worked/didn't work? Were you able to find healthcare providers that understood and supported your process? I am very nervous/don't know exactly how to proceed for myself since most trans healthcare seems to be binary focused. Thanks in advance for your stories and input!	"everyone’s definition of a partial transition will be different. what are some things you’re interested in pursuing / secondary characteristics you ideally want?
If you transition as much as you intend to, it's still a complete transition, whether or not it looks the same as a binary person's transition.

As to how easy or difficult it is to medically transition as a nonbinary person, a lot of it depends on your insurance and/or national healthcare system. You would get a lot more relevant advice if you indicated which country you're in.
Well, the easiest, I feel, is getting rid of my body hair especially my facial hair, so I am already looking into laser/electrolysis. After that, I feel like things get really complicated. I want to have more feminine features but not transition all the way to female. There's definitely surgeries down the line (if I can ever afford them) such as ffs, potentially. 

Hrt intrigues me and also makes me nervous. It doesn't help that most of the medical literature I have read is only geared towards binary transitioning. There was a post a long time ago on reddit where a user broke down the various drugs and what *might* work for different people, but they made it clear they were not a medical professional and that there was insufficient data to guarantee anything.

I guess I was mostly interested in hearing how other enbies had approached it. Whether they had even decided to pursue the medical route, or if they did were they happy with it, etc. I understand that everyone has their own journey and no two will be necessarily the same. I guess I just wanted to feel less alone in the process. All my friends are cis, so there is a limit to how much they can relate/discuss.
Very true, I had not looked at it that way. I've only ever heard it referred to as partial transitioning.

I am in the US, so it varies highly by state. Sorry I forgot to mention that before. That is part of why I am curious what other people's experiences have been, though in part, I was not looking for as much direct advice, more a general curiosity about how other enbies had approached it.
totally. i’m afab and medically transitioned so my experience probably wouldn’t offer much help. if you haven’t yet it could also be helpful to cross post in mtf and transytalk to reach a broader audience for advice. i always overlap communities even tho i’m not binary trans. i hope you get some good insight friend! 💜

It only really varies by state all that much if you're on Medicaid. It's more down to insurance company than anything.

While the US healthcare system is obviously a dumpster fire, we do have one thing going for us in that we can get HRT through informed consent. This means HRT is pretty easily accessible even for nonbinary people. Since I'm AFAB, my own experiences are much use in terms of med choice, dosages, etc.

When it came to surgery, there are a couple times where I felt it was safest to ""lie"" and say I was a trans man. But it also doesn't really distress me all that much to be referred to with masculine pronouns or dress in a masculine way for a couple of appointments, especially if the alternative was not getting surgery.

Every LGBT provider I had, be it in the LGBT clinic I went to or just providers that happened to be LGBT, made comments that showed they were cool with nonbinary people. I've gotten a lot of microaggressions from elsewhere, though, especially in the women's hospital I went to for top surgery. (The surgeon herself was great, but she specialized in mastectomies for cancer patients.)
Thank you! I'll work on those crossposts.
Sadly, I am on Medicaid. :/
Hopefully, I will someday get a job that has better benefits/ higher pay.

I am very happy we have informed consent. I also found a great therapy clinic that specializes in all gender and sexual identities. They provided a web page that listed medical providers in my area that were ""friendly"" though I read through some of their responses to a questionnaire and some were definitely gatekeepers, so I totally understand the necessity of ""lying.""

Hi! uh... kinda just need to heard out about a transmed best friend haha	"Sorry if this is... a bad post?? this is literally my first time posting on reddit, I don't have anyone else to talk about this stuff, and I just... really need someone to Also Know what I just went though

He's been my best friend for over a decade, and he's been an out but... fairly quiet transmed for years now. He agrees nonbinary people are valid, but says you need SOME kind of dysphoria to not be cis, and seriously hates neopronouns & genderfluid people... along with basically idolizing Kalvin Garrah.

When I thought I was cis, I just kind of stayed quiet whenever he would say things I thought were cruel, because i figured as a ""cis"" person i wouldn't have say in the matter... apparently he thought I was supporting him. After this and that in our friend discord, I say transmedicalist ideas are hard to grow out of, and he takes offense. I say he's the only one I've seen that doesn't hate nonbinary people. He brings up Garrah. I say he would've called me a trantrender and insulted my body. He says Garrah isn't like that anymore. I say he still popularized the idea that one needs to want surgery to be trans, even if he Really Did Change. 

I try to give up and stop the conversation after he says ""no, people just assume that, youre on the wrong side of history"" by saying ""agree to disagree!""

He tells me he's offended. That he's trying to be supportive, and that I'm attacking his ideology. He's my best friend, so I panic and try to soothe him by saying *his* version of transmedicalism is fine, its the rest that sucks. He says I don't get to SPEAK on transmedicalism because I ""don't know anything""

So, obviously, I say ""I'm speaking on it as someone who's been HURT by it."" Transmedicalist ideas I've unfortunately absorbed lead me to constantly worrying about whether or not I'm just ""playing trans"" because I don't hate my body, or particularly hate being misgendered, and I've almost gone back to calling myself a cis person multiple times. He knows I worry about it.

He starts quizzing me, demanding proof that, yes, I'd been hurt. I have memory problems, but I can still remember one of his worse moments, gossiping about a transman who didn't match up to his (rather, Grarrah's) idea of transness, saying he isn't really trans because he didn't want surgery. He throws out my evidence because he doesn't remember doing it himself, so its basically just heresay.

And then he says ""but yeah, I'd agree with old me.""

I don't notice that he basically just said ""yes, I still fully think you need surgery to be trans"" and I'm still thinking about how he was focusing on social dysphoria a few messages back, so I point out how he's contradicting himself when he says he's only ever thought social dysphoria was necessary... and then I finally realize what he'd just told me, and I give up. I start focusing on how I thought most transmedicalists outright hated nonbinary people, and how I was wrong about that, so we can just stop the conversation. He keeps going.

He says I just don't wanna admit he's right, that ""agree to disagree is a shitty way to end an argument"" and that I'm ignoring HIS proof, that I'm a being a Dick about his beliefs that I've apparently defended relentlessly. He told me he thinks I'm *Really Actually For Real* Nonbinary because I experience social dysphoria. In that same sentence he says I decided I was nonbinary. He has been my best friend for over a decade.

I tell him once I realized his ideology excluded swaths of people, he says *that's not what transmedicalim is.* He says I don't know shit because I only just recently came out, even though I know I've spent hours enjoying watching trans people talk about their experiences and thoughts on ""trans discourse"" years before I came out. He says i'm pulling the ""trans card"" and acting like i know everything and that I'm *putting him down* in our friend discord.

He calls me a radfem, because I think Kalvin Garrah is a bad person, and that you don't need dysphoria to be trans. Then he talks about some bullshit about how neopronouns are ruining the credibility of *\~Real Trans People\~* and goes on to talk about how hating transmedicalists is radfem culture """"because it excludes people from Healthcare they need to realize their gender identity by invalidating it""""

I double down on apologizing for thinking most transmedicalists outright hated nonbinary people. it finally holds, and he focuses in on it. The conversion comes to a close. But not before he DMs me to say he doesn't forgive me."	"Shit, I'm sorry. Not many nonbinary-hating things get to me anymore, but transmedicalism always finds a way to upset me. I think it's because the people who are meant to understand us and be our allies turn on us, it feels like a betrayal and it angers me. They claim to still support us but we're always on the edge it feels like, if you're not a ""good nonbinary"" then you get attacked. I'm sorry this happened to you, it sounds horrific and stressful."	ojz9ay	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-07-14 07:26:40

Experiences in Healthcare	"Hi :) I already did one of these polls in another subreddit (not enby specific) to find out what experiences people have with health care (both in the system and with accessing it).

I am a trans guy and am currently personally struggling a bit against and in the system, so for my college ethics class I am investigating how trans nonbinary/gender non-conforming individuals experience access to and treatment within the health care system they are in.

The results will not be published or anything, it's just for a report for my college professors. I also hope this is ok to post here, I do not mean to make anyone uncomfortable!

Please feel free to comment under the post to specify or elaborate on your answer or to share anything you want to.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ra9uzj)"	"All of the above. I talk to some of my providers about my identity but not others. Sometimes they respect me and sometimes they don't. Sometimes they will gatekeep care, or my insurance won't cover it and I can't afford it out of pocket. Sometimes I avoid treatment because of the reactions I've received in the past (see: trans broken arm syndrome). And some trans-specific medical care isn't on my agenda to be comfortable and healthy.
I do not want any gender related medical procedures.

I have avoided seeking treatment/routine care because I don’t have a doctor I can be out to and the care I need causes dysphoria.

I am quite scared to talk about my identity with my health care provider especially because I am nonbinary and I am not out to my employer, which provides my medical insurance."	ra9uzj	NonBinary	1	1.0	2021-12-06 15:30:20
HRT for enbys	"So I'm an AMAB androphilic queer and I identify as non-binary. To that end, I'm interested in enhancing my femininity, without reducing my masculinity, and I'm thinking about doing so using HRT. I feel like I'm imbalanced too much in the direction of masculinity and hope increasing my femininity through taking feminizing hormones will help even things out. 

I'm primarily interested in internal, psychological changes that will permit a closer, more visceral relationship with my emotions and an arousal pattern more frequently seen in AFAB people, amongst other effects. I'm also hoping to change the way my penis functions so that it becomes more sensitized and doesn't require an erection and ejaculation to have an orgasm. I'm not terribly concerned with things like fat distribution, changes in skin, breast development, etc. one way or the other. I'd prefer to continue to pass as male when I want to for social fit but it's not a deal-breaker.

I do have dysphoria in the sense that my inability to connect with my emotions and me not really feeling like my penis is mine creates what can be, at times, severe discomfort. 

Based on my research, it would seem to be that estradiol by itself (without spiro or progesterone) would be the best option to achieve what I'm looking for. Has anyone here tried something similar to this? If so, how did you find it?

I know that this doesn't fit into the ""typical"" trans healthcare paradigm so I'm also looking for advice on how to present myself to a clinician so that they don't just boot me out of the door. I'm waiting to get a call back from the local gender clinic to set up an appointment and wanted to know what to say going in. Unfortunately, the system is not designed for enbies, so I need to learn how to work it.

Thanks to everyone in advance!"		nadzi4	NonBinary	1	1.0	2021-05-12 02:11:36
Has anyone who is diagnosed with a personality disorder & who identifies as trans and/or nonbinary found their identity questioned by their healthcare professionals?	"Full disclosure - I am nonbinary trans, and have BPD. I am extremely lucky that my therapist has been incredibly supportive of my coming out & transitioning. I know there are biases against us by some (such as known bigot James Cantor) who claim that because a feature of BPD is lack of personal identity means that we can’t “claim to be trans” because we will “never know who we are” (never mind the fact that not all pwBPD experience this particular feature/diagnostic criteria). I’m trying to come up with a research proposal in my class to explore this, but I am having a hard time finding data on people’s experiences. Does anyone have any suggestions on where to start, or have lived experiences of their own they would feel comfortable sharing? I will not be using any responses in my data & research, just trying to get a feel for what direction I should go in. 

Mods, if this post goes against any community guidelines, I deeply apologize & will take this post down."	"You might have better luck posting this to the BPD subreddit. I don't have BPD but I have bipolar type 2 and was always worried that I would be dismissed or invalidated because of my mental health. 

I work with a social worker who currently has a BPD client. She kept misgendering him and making it sound like she believed his trans identity was invalid because of his BPD. I don't know how she acts towards him but I hope he finds a new therapist if that's the way she thinks.
That’s some sage advice - I just went ahead and put this post up over in one of the BPD subreddits. Thank you for your input!

As for your social worker colleague - that’s incredibly disheartening to hear, and it’s precisely the kind of thing I want to explore more of, and to see how widespread or common this perception of pwBPD is in the trans community. I want to get more qualitative data on this in order to bring awareness to this type of bias. I hope her client seeks a different provider, as well - he deserves better than that.

should I do T?	"to preface: I'm 16 and have a certain leaning towards ""masculinity"", I guess.
No it's not that I'm masculine—I'm **not.** I am *so* far from masculine and I can tell you that right now; I'm 4'11"", 85lb, and I actually really hate the thought of being beefy or hairy or square or you know *traditionally masculine in pretty much any sense.*
It's more a leaning towards, I guess, being a feminine boy. Like those scene boys from 2007, you feel? Take away the ""rawr lol xD"" part and I shamelessly wish I looked just a *bit* more like them.
But of course there's a certain inherent genderqueerness in that that makes me not a ""full"" boy.

Then there's the body dysphoria. Frankly, right now, its the most present kind of dysphoria I have and it won't go away. As for my breasts I'm torn between keeping them and working towards a mastectomy but I'm not sure; I already bind pretty much all the time so it's not like there's much of a point in keeping them, but sometimes I still want to keep them and I'm not sure if it's real or if I just like how they look or something else /shrug emoji
Theeen there's the bottom dysphoria and that is *much* stronger. I want a dick, and its really as plain and simple as that. Out of this whole mess of confusion I've been dealing with for a year, if there's one thing I can wholeheartedly take from it it is that *goddamn I wish I had a dick.* A lot of the time I pack and honestly its a little embarrassing to admit I like to shove a sock down my pants but for me it's pretty helpful. That and pretty much whenever I think about having any kind of sex with anyone, like ya do, I imagine myself with a dick almost all the time.

Don't get me wrong though, I'm not a boy. In terms of my *body* I might have leanings towards something more male, but in every other aspect I'm pretty much entirely androgynous.
What I want to know if I should try going on T. Maybe not now, maybe not for a long time, but if I'm going to do it eventually I might as well start working towards it now (especially since my country supposedly might have just taken away my healthcare what up lmao)

thanks I'll check them out!!
As for a gender therapist I'm not quiiiite sure how to go about that since I do already have a regular therapist (though she does have experience with trans kids and does know some about my gender situation) and am looking for a psychiatrist for other reasons, sooo???
And about the penis thing: I already know going in what I'll get in terms of that if I go on T. What I'm *really* wondering is if just being on T will help or ease or really do anything about the dysphoria
yeah that's what I was thinking, but I'm still not sure if it would be 100% worth it, considering the expenses and other effects of T ://
The hair for example—thats something I want 0 part of
Thanks;  that was what I worried about, especially since I really don't know the full extent of if

Doing Research On Disparities In Health Care Outcomes For The Trans And Non-Binary Community - Looking For Resources!	" Tldr: I'm doing a research assignment about trans and nonbinary healthcare and would love any personal anecdotes and resources.

I'm a health sciences student currently taking a Cultural Aspects Of Health class, where we learn about communicating with and to cultural groups outside of our original cultural bias. As health care providers, there's an early push to accept certain viewpoints and dynamics between yourself and a patient, which often becomes this attitude of self-importance that can lead to miscommunications with patients. This, along with pre-established ideas about patient populations, can negatively affect treatment/care outcomes for many groups.

Our final project for the class is doing a presentation on the health outcomes for a group of our choice. One of my siblings is in the process of transitioning ftm right now, so I'm really interested in learning about what barriers or biases trans and non-binary individuals face in trying to get quality health care. If anyone is interested, I'd really appreciate some resources and insight on these points:

1. ""Identify resources that providers may access when caring for a specific cultural population."" Despite years of college and internships, a lot of doctors don't really have a good idea what departments to refer their trans and non-binary patients to and where to get resources so they can provide the best care. If you have reputable websites or help centers for trans and non-binary health care, I would really appreciate links to them.
2. ""Investigate opportunities and challenges that a specific cultural group/sub-group face in obtaining and utilizing unbiased healthcare."" What are some the unique challenges trans and non-binary individuals face in trying to obtain the best care possible? Health insurance bias, barriers in access to surgery/hormones/ect, discrimination in entering health care, anything that makes obtaining care harder.
3. ""What are some beliefs, customs, and behavioral patterns of a cultural group/sub-group in the United States society that should be considered and understood by a health care provider?"" If a health care provider has a Hmong patient who cannot do repeated blood tests due to their beliefs, they might be frustrated and label it as non-compliance if they aren't first aware of those beliefs. In the context of the trans and non-binary community, are there reasons individuals may avoid or be hesitant to obtain care, such as fear of misgendering/invasive questions? What should a doctor understand so they can provide sympathetic and compassionate care?
4. ""Relate strategies to address the unique health care needs among various cultural groups and sub-group."" Are there any resources I can look into for learning about the unique health care needs of trans and non-binary patients, and how health care providers can address these?

I'll also be going to [r/ftm](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/) and r/MtF for more information. Seriously, if you've taken the time to read this long post and are comfortable providing me with resources for my presentation, thank you!"	"I changed my gender to non-binary on my care providers app (university backed health care) and it prompted that I needed to schedule a mammogram as a result. Am amab, and found that amusing.
For point 1, my first thought is the WPATH standards, though they certainly have some problems. Planned Parenthood is a good resource in a lot of cases, with access to informed consent HRT. Local transgender/non-binary groups are an obvious suggestion, but are going to vary depending on where the provider is located.

For point 2, probably the biggest barriers are cost and bias. Insurance isn't legally required to cover transition care in a lot of cases, or may consider some procedures to be elective when they really aren't (but might be in other circumstances). As far as bias goes, there are plenty of doctors out there who don't believe transgender and non-binary identities are real, or may have reservations about treating a trans/non-binary patient for a number of reasons from religious grounds to lack of training in the kinds of care we need. Of particular note in the bias arena is the prevalence of Trans Broken Arm Syndrome. ""Doctor, I fell off my bike and broke my arm, can you help me?"" ""Sure, but first let's talk about your gender. Have you tried therapy?"" I've been turned away from care where the doctor won't even see me for things that are clearly within their scope and training, to doctors who will see me but literally talk about nothing I'm seeking care for because they focus solely on my gender. Doctors in the US healthcare system are afforded a lot of latitude in their personal practices, and those that are biased against transgender and non-binary patients exercise that regularly. And it's particularly problematic in rural areas, where access to other providers may be limited, which brings us back around to cost since it's more expensive to drive to another city to seek care and miss work etc.

For 3, my two top concerns are addressing patients respectfully and asking appropriate questions related to care. Forms should have fields that describe things that actually matter, for example don't ask about gender if what you really mean is sex; don't skip pregnancy questions just because someone identifies as a man. Have a write-in option for pronouns and true name (if different from legal name), and train all staff from doctors to sanitation crew to respect what's written on the chart. And don't ask me about my genitals when I'm in for a broken arm; keep questions directed to the care at hand, and don't use position authority to satisfy personal curiosity. Many patients won't know if these questions are relevant or not, and will feel pressured to answer, even though it will have no bearing on the assessment or treatment. Also, recognize that we're routinely denied access to healthcare and refused respectful address. Many of us specifically avoid care for these reasons, or may have maladaptive behaviors that can produce medical issues. Self harm is an obvious possibility, but discomfort using gendered bathrooms at work or school can result in a patient not drinking fluids, resulting in frequent UTIs (ask me how I know).

For 4, I mean you could ask here and get a laundry list. I'm happy to provide a bunch of concerns and unique care needs if that would be helpful. I don't have a specific resource in mind that would list them though.

Honestly the resources you're asking for don't really exist, or are not so well known that I've heard of them despite working in healthcare for a decade *and* being non-binary. I'm guessing one of the outcomes of your research is that a centralized resource for healthcare providers to understand gender-diverse patients and their needs is sorely needed."	qprdln	NonBinary	1	1.0	2021-11-09 00:28:47
