In case anyone needs affirmation, here’s a comic reminding you that your interests aren’t gendered. Like what you like! ✨		"Exactly. If cis people’s gender isn’t defined by their interests, why should that be the case for trans people? 💛
This was so needed today. I stopped wearing makeup for a few months after I started using they/them pronouns so I could get “taken seriously”. As it turns out…I love wearing makeup with traditionally masc looks! True gender euphoria for me is a combination of both.
I needed this, and honestly at this point I don't consider myself ""trans-anything"" except maybe ""trans-myself,"" but the ""trans"" label still doesn't feel right as I'm not ""transitioning,"" rather just allowing myself to be myself.  A concept which I struggled with for several months before finally figuring it out and accepting it 🤷‍♂️🤷
Gender is an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Take the stuff you like, leave the stuff you don't.  Want to mix ice cream, mashed potatoes, and peas?  Cool.
I needed this, TY!
Gendering hobbies is such bullshit. I've been discredited my whole life in things I enjoy as an AFAB because they're traditionally 'masculine'. Whatever the hell that means.

It's a huge reason why I'm done with gendering anything and everyone unless they specifically ask for it. Why would I judge anyone's capabilities or interests by their gender?
This. So much. The gender is still in our heads even as we try to walk the other way. But really it's only a label attached by society
I really struggle with this - I'm a nonbinary trans man with a lot of 'feminine' interests and hobbies - and it's so daft. a cis dude wouldn't be less of a dude for liking soft toys, why am I beating myself up for it? thank you for this comic <3
We need to normalize this for people of every gender/sexual identity - whether they're trans, cis, nonbinary, gay, straight, etc...

Society will be a lot happier (and hopefully a lot less bigoted) once we stop asking ourselves ""oh, is it okay for me as \[insert gender/sexuality here\] to like this thing?""
Yup. I cycle through pretty much every stage in this comic on repeat. It can be frustrating but I try to remember it's just part of how I'm growing and learning about how I prefer to present.
Yeah... That's about where I am right now. Lil genderflux trans girl just having a meltdown every time I find myself being ""too masculine"". It's really eating at me. I think this is why even though I LOVE being a girl I also quite love the idea of being non binary. It feels liberating. Again though, this is flawed: just because I specifically feel very happy being exclusively she/her doesn't mean I have to limit myself and avoid supposedly ""manly things"". 

Anyway... I wish I could abandon my toxic thinking faster.
I'm still working on deconstructing this mindset. I find it really easy to get caught up in what is feminine and masculine, even when it doesn't pertain to gender in fears that people will question my ""transness"". It was a weird realisation moment for me that these things don't matter, when I started to receive compliments that I had associated as being directed at women such as pretty and beautiful (I'm transmasc), but were followed up with bro/man. It made me realise that people could still see me as a guy despite my ""femininity"" and in fact, it made no difference. Realising this made me far more confident in expressing the parts of myself that I had preciously deemed as ""feminine"".
This, 100%! I’m a trans man, and I’m so glad I’ve finally gained some confidence in who I am. It was really rough being young and self-conscious about my interests. I am a grown man and if I want crochet and grow flowers and teach my niece to style her hair, then I am going to fucking do it. 

No such thing as gendered interests.
Thank you! I've been recently able to explore what I used to see as feminine interests and likes and it's been so nice. I used to try to force out anything remotely feminine all my life. It's so nice to not feel guilty for enjoying nice things, I'm really trying to savour that feeling. Love your comics <3
An important part of it for me was realizing that the important part wasn’t that I still enjoyed dresses despite being agender—it was that those things didn’t make me _feel feminine._

I like makeup because I’m an artist, not because it makes me feel feminine.
I feel so grateful that the first trans person I knew was a trans woman with the world's most 'masculine' degree, job AND hobbies. It helped me understand early on that those things don't have anything to do with anything.
Exactly! I love sewing and cooking, and I had my favorite dolls when I was a child, but I also loved playing with my brother's and friends' building toys, and I am proud of my skill in fixing things in the house.
Yes, this. All of this.
I know I'm still working on that. I love makeup as just a form of art, I love painting on myself, it just so happens most of my practice is in really dramatic fem makeup . I know it's fine to be masc and like fem makeup but It still reminds me of all the years in the closet where that was my normal. I kinda have to think of it like drag or being a gay femboy (both of which is kinda true) but I hope some day it can just be self expression. I just need more time I think.
The panel with the alcoholic drinks makes a good point. Beer is often seen as masculine, and other fruity or sweet drinks are seen as feminine. But the real, objective, ungendered truth is that beer is ass and fruity/sweet drinks are the best.
Thank you. This really is a beautiful comic. That's been me with interests on and off. It's clothing choices at the moment.
As a transfem person I’ve recently taken up a couple of stereotypically masculine interests such as car maintenance. If you’re interested in something, don’t let how it’s gendered stop you
Love thiss! Amazing work.
I appreciate this 🏳️‍🌈❤️🔥
I'm some kinda masc gender but I totally did the same thing,
I tried hiding all my ""feminine"" likes and even the way I spoke or walked because I felt like no one would take me seriously other wise since ""that's not how boys / guys do stuff""

Made me feel worse but kept going till I hit a point that I didn't even feel like myself anymore or anything I'd like to transition to. 

Finally quit trying so hard and feel a lot better. 
I am myself, nothing more or less.
Exactly, I have came out as Non-binary after 2-3 years now And recognized that I can do whatever I want without worrying about my Gender because what I like or what I do is separated from my Gender identity
Your art style is super pretty..
Love this! Good job tackling a difficult subject in do few words! Comics are hard
Edit: so few*
I have a few Barbie dolls and I wear masculine clothes. I have masculine manga and anime interests (who said enbies can't like Dragon Ball?).
What a beautiful post. Thank you.
omg thank you for this, as someone who loves ""girly"" stuff like squishmallows, makeup, decorating my apartment, skincare, I always felt like I had to tone it down but this is adorable
this is something I'm still working on bc I went through something similar when I started questioning my identity, just from the opposite starting point as OP. it's good to see not only that I'm not alone in that struggle, but that there's a light at the end of the tunnel :)
I love historical working class dresses. I feel good and myself in them. It doesn't make me less NB for it. Hell given some the the odd shapes of the underpinnings it is very non-binary esc. (I'm a sucker for the shape stays give my body lol).
I find this interesting! Ever since coming out I have started to learn how to use tools and do typical “masculine” things like woodwork, maintenance, etc which when I identified as Cis seemed far from a task that interested me, probably due to me hiding from myself that I didn’t want to be a male
# #genderabolition
Damn this hits 😩💯
Damn this hits 😩💯
Damn this hits 😩💯
I see you.
This is so true, and idk if anyone else experienced something similar. I initially fought to be super masculine to ""suppress"" the feminine portions of myself, until just like the comic completely flipped to be affirmed as a woman. Although now, and I'm unsure if others here feel the same, now ""I am me"" pretty well defines who I am. Not male, not female, not any gender in particular, in fact. Just another person with trauma trying to move on in life and enjoy whatever I find enjoyable, dress however I choose to dress and see the forest for the trees so to speak. 
And idk if this will bring about condemnation in this thread, but I'm now beyond caring what gender I am (or anyone is, for that matter. It may be controversial, but I find it liberating. People are just people, not men and women, not trans men and trans women, not enbies and agender, just people. We seem so focused on learning all we can about the world around us and naming and categorising life as a whole. We forget that those ""categories"" are just figments of society. They may be someone's personal truth, but that's the great thing about personal truths they are yours to believe, and no one can change that. If you choose those ""truths"" are untrue, then simply choose different truths.
I struggle with this a lot. Mostly I don't care but I do have a problem with my parents in law and what they will think. Especially since I'm not out to them and never will and I'm AFAB. I'm afraid to like feminine things because everytime I come dressed in a skirt or a dress or put makeup on, they see me more as a woman and are happy (I usually dress very masculine) because it's the stupid society expectation. I don't blame them - they aren't exactly involved with ""politics"", they tend to keep their distance and I'm sure if they knew how I feel when they react to me being more *stereotypically* feminine, they would stop. They are good people. I came out to them as bisexual 2 years ago and they didn't say anything wrong. They took their time to accept this piece of info but their behaviour towards me didn't change one bit. I can't come out as nb or whatever I am (constantly questioning) so I can't exactly tell them not to be happy when I ""dress like a girl"". And I love skirts on occassion!
I have a shop with a car lift where I build jeeps and classic cars.  Not once, in any shop, have I seen someone effectively turn a wrench on a vehicle with their penis.

Love what you do and let the haters choke on their bigotry.
To be fair I think a fair amount of cis people only have interests because it is something stereotypically associated with their gender.
same, but the other way around.  i thought having to get up early enough to put on a full face would be my undoing, but really what i've learned is that i just love doing my eyes up, and the rest of my face really doesn't bother me so much anymore.  so i'll throw on some mascara and liner for most days, masc or femme, and if i'm feeling REALLY fancy then i'll break out the pallettes, lol.
Same! It feels good to be doing my makeup for myself now instead of feeling like I shouldn’t wear it because I’m enby or that I was wearing it because it is societally expected of AFAB people.
I want do start doing makeup that way. Do you have any tips? I haven't done any makeup in so long..
Is there a word for vicarious gender euphoria
Trans actually doesn't refer to transition at all. It is  Latin word root that before describing gender was used in chemestry to describe molicule configurations. Trans mean across / on the other side of and cis means on the same side as. For gender it only means that someone's gender is anything different than what was assigned to them at birth. No transition is needed at all for someone to be trans and unless they are fluid or something most trans people feel they have always been their gender from the day they were born but were just labeled wrong.

This is not however saying you should use a label you don't feel connected to. Just explaining the label in case that helps.
Same and it feels good reading someone that feels the same way 🥰
I feel this so much, like yes I'm technically transgender by definition (I don't agree with being afab)
However even if I transition I feel like I'm just being me. 
I don't know, I cycle through gender identitys, one day one thing will sound good then the next day it doesn't, so I've pretty much just gave up trying to pin it down and focus on being happy / figuring out what I want to do transition wise.
My thoughts exactly!
This is incredibly wholesome to see, I love it
>Gender is an all-you-can-eat buffet.

I like to say gender presentation is a stage show and you get to pick your costume and props, but I like this too!
Wasabi peas and ice cream sounds kinda good
Yes!

My mother isn't what you'd call an LGBTQ ally, but she's usually pretty supportive of me. I came out as nonbinary to her and she asked me to explain what it meant. By the time I finished she scoffed and said ""that just sounds like a bunch of stupid labels people made up. Just be yourself."" She's supportive in her own way.

Of course, I later tested the waters about clothing by telling her about F1NN5TER and talking about how a lot of conventionally fem clothes were originally popularized as men's fashion in the past. She made it very clear that she finds men wearing women's clothing disgusting and she hopes I never do that.

So I keep that stuff in the closet for now. Baby steps.
Society does not define who we are. If it did trans people wouldn’t exist. Society is often wrong
My late husband was a cis man whose Second Life avator was a beautiful female fairy, and he loved making jewelry, but also building and repairing machinery and things around the house.
Love this for you. Never feel invalidated or insecure about your interests and hobbies! They’re wonderful and don’t add or remove anything from your gender identity.
Teddy bears are the most manly thing ever - it's a wild, dangerous animal and you've gotten a miniature, inanimate one and are keeping it in your home.
It takes time, just be gentle with yourself! I hope in time you’ll be able to accept all parts of yourself and see the validity of that :)
>even though I LOVE being a girl I also quite love the idea of being non binary. It feels liberating.

AFAB here who feels the exact same way sometimes. Of every gender identity out there ""woman"" feels the least wrong but it's not quite right either, and I like the concept of gender as a fluctuating point on a spectrum, not a static setting on a binary switch.
That’s awesome! Yes, just let yourself enjoy things ✨
What are the most masculine hobbies?
Thank you so much 💕
Thank you for acknowledging this! One of the hardest parts of making these comics is fitting big ideas (often complex emotions or social issues!) into 4 short panels with as few words as possible…it’s a lot harder than the artwork itself lol!
Those are all wonderful things that have no gender! Squishmallows are for all people, never deprive yourself of that joy! 😄
This is such a cool interest/hobby! Now I want to look into this and try one on!
Gender abolition is trans abolition, FYI. People are allowed to have genders, it’s part of nature. Don’t ever confuse stereotypes with gender. That’s exactly what the comic is about
Mobile bug lol
Yes many don’t even realize how they’ve been duped by companies. I can’t telll you the number of people who bite back at me when I say women only shave their legs and Pitts now because of marketing from The BIC razor company. It’s literally invented by a razor company to sell more razors and the “meaning” of diamonds it’s by a diamond company to sell more diamonds! It’s all marketing BS. Companies gender things to sell twice as much of their product for no reason.
My makeup routine tends to be pretty simple (I sweat easily lol), but I usually like a simple glitter on the eyes, a soft winged eyeliner, and a bold lipstick! Simplicity tends to make an outfit pop in my opinion.
I guess I've been reading too much transmed stuff in a desperate attempt to invalidate myself 🥺😥
I'm saving this comment, excellently written!
110%
I am so sorry for your loss, thank you for sharing this though it's really lovely
I don't want to be too specific, but engineering and mechanics-y things.

I am definitely not saying those things OUGHT to be male-coded, but they are.
right!! squishmallows are the best
It's a **very** expensive hobby to get into. I learned sewing and dyeing just to be able to afford it lol. I dye my own muslin (because it's a tough as nails fabric and well suited for working class clothes).
Depends on what exactly you mean by ""gender abolition"". There are certainly some people who mean ""homogenize everyone into the same 'mix of everything' gender"", but, at least in my experience, they're less common than the ones who, like myself, mean something more like ""knock gender down to a trait that people are no more divided into groups by than, say, eye color"".
>Companies gender things to sell twice as much of their product for no reason.

Gender was invented by bathroom companies to sell twice as many bathrooms! 

And knowing women only shave their body hair because of razor company marketing makes me feel a lot better as an AFAB person who chooses not to shave mine, not for gender reasons but just because it costs spoons I don't have and it's more annoying when it's growing back after shaving it than it is if I leave it alone.
Nice! That sounds awesome 🙂
I'm sorry you're dealing with that.
Thank you.
Amazing!! That’s so cool!
Yes you found the meme I was referencing! lol and I agree it’s like why would anyone shave if it was unnecessary? It’s okay if you shave because you like to but it’s stupid to shame people for not doing it when the stuff literally grows on your body.

"Stop asking if you ""pass as non-binary"" (Rant)"	"That isn't a *thing*. You can't ""pass"" as non-binary any more than you can ""pass"" as gay. If you're gay you're gay. If you're non-binary, YOU. ARE. NON-BINARY.

**Non-binary** **≠ Androgyny.**

If you are asking if your clothing or makeup helps to make you look more androgynous because that's how *you* would like to look, that is a perfectly fine question. But carrying the mindset that non-binary people should look more androgynous as a way of more fully stepping into their enby identity is harmful to both you (believing you need to do *X* in order to ""pass"") and the non-binary community more broadly, where it can invalidate identity by setting irrelevant expectations based on looks, and can trigger dysphoria for others.

Thank you for listening to my TEDTalk.

EDIT: This also applies to seemingly positive posts saying, ""Look how enby I look today!"" -- because you can't ""look enby"", you *are* enby. You're just dressing in a way that further validates that for **you**, just as any other type of dress can be validating for another enby. ""I love how this clothing makes me feel like myself!"" = perfect."	"Thank you for saying this! Agreed! I’m so sick of seeing posts like those. It’s so invalidating for so many in our community. I, as an androgynous enby who loves androgyny for myself, don’t ever want to be seen as “more nonbinary” or more valid in my identity than enbies who aren’t or don’t want to be androgynous. The whole concept of “passing” is so harmful and is a huge step backwards in a community where we’re trying to show the world that anyone of any gender (or lack thereof) can and should express themselves however they want!
Thank you! It's triggering for me whenever people say that so it doesn't create a safe space for me here too. I get told all the time, as an actor, that I don't look non-binary enough, even tho that is bullshit. Considering leaving the group because of that.
Thank you for this post. I’ve been seeing a rise in the past week of these posts and it’s honestly been making me feel like crap. I’m also worried that newer/discovering enbies will think they have to look a certain way to be “truly” be nonbinary when that isn’t the case at all. That’s why I’m so glad that the r/LGBT subreddit made a new rule addressing this issue.
THANK YOU. It feels like this sub is 50% ""do I pass?"" and 50% ""what should my name be?"" and it's starting to become tiresome. Surely there are more interesting and relevant things we could discuss that are less likely to trigger dysphoria for people innocently scrolling.
I also don't really think that it's possible to look androgynous in the sense that many people mean it - I think some people use androgynous to mean having other people not be able to guess your assigned or presenting gender, which is incredibly difficult to achieve and depends entirely on the person looking at you and the cultural context in which you live.

I think it's more achievable to present androgynously in the sense of being read 50/50 by other people, or intentionally presenting mixed gender cues, but of course neither is necessary for being non-binary!
Ppl doesnt understand the difference between gender identity, gender expression and sexual orientation
THANK YOU!!! This trend is suuuuuuper upsetting to me, and I think it ought to be added to the rules, because it makes me feel dysphoric and small. I literally hate the concept of passing. Like, do I pass the acceptance of the cis test?? It’s absurd.
THANK YOUUUUU. Nonbinary is an umbrella term. It does not mean ""genderless"".
A million times yes, queerness is about not fitting a mold and owning your whole self, androgyny is one way to express yourself but relegating non-binary people into an ambiguous “third gender” is so regressive. 

I really wish we could take some kind of action, to stop this constant gender checking. It’s so triggering !
Yes!!! It is so invalidating and harmful to this community to repeatedly see posts defining what classifies as a “non-binary look”. The point is that we are not confined to any look or definition. Gender euphoria is great and we are here to support each other’s self expression, but not to decide what does and doesn’t fit into a stereotypical view of what it means to be non-binary. When one person’s goal becomes recognized as a universal standard for non-binary presentation it can be so invalidating to other people.
Yeah that’s totally true. I just like always saying “yes you do” to those posts no matter what they look like lmao.

That’s basically the main reason I support their existence.
I agree with this. I’m AFAB and sometimes I present extremely feminine. Does that detract from the fact that I am non-binary? Absolutely not. Sometimes I present extremely masculine. Sometimes androgyny is the word of the day. None of these things weigh into the fact that I finally know who I am. That’s where the joy lies for me.
There have been days where I've just wanted to step out of this sub because I'm never going to look androgynous, I don't want to look androgynous, and I feel less valid because of all the pressure to do so.

It's bad enough outside of spaces like this, I don't like that it's coming from INSIDE these spaces, too.
I will never be androgynous. I have huge tits and a fat ass. That don't make me any less enby. 

Thank you for your ted talk.
 I don't believe in any kind of universal nonbinary expression - there's no way to pass as something people don't recognize the existence of in the first place - or even any universal expression of the binary genders. 

The idea of passing-as-goal is just so deeply toxic. At best, ""I must meet these arbitrary benchmarks of physicality and behavior for my own safety"" is symptomatic of a broken society, and at worst we get bullshit like ""if you cannot meet these arbitrary standards, you should just cease to exist"" and it's infuriating. Life is hard enough, don't tear down your sibs, we don't owe androgyny or ambiguity to anyone for any reason
Yeah as a trans masculine nonbinary person it really sucks to see so many younger folks (I'm 25) asking if they pass or not, as well as makes me feel less and less accepted as nonbinary since people view me as a man 90% of the time.

It shouldn't even be a thing for trans men and women honestly, because it still enforces colonialism and pushes western beauty standards and aesthetics onto people who have nothing to do with the person asking.

Our physical features do not have a gender, that's just what society wants us to believe so that we'll change ourselves to fit into cisnormative boxes. Not only is that not accessible to everyone, not everyone wants to change their bodies in ways that would make them ""pass"" and they shouldn't be made to feel wrong for that.

I know most in defense of this phenomenon will claim it's only about the feelings of those asking, but that's not true nor is it realistic. There will always be people who look like you and who don't have the same gender as you. Asking if you pass it's putting scrutiny on those people as well along with anyone else who may share key features with you that contribute to both how you view yourself and how others view you.
Honestly I'd like a ban on selfies as well as the 'do I look [gender]' posts, or at least limiting them to recurring threads on certain days. Inherent problems with seeking validation on one's appearance on the internet aside, they tend to detract from threads with more substantive discussion.
*Thank you.* I've been feeling like shit because I'm a little more femme than a lot of people on this subreddit. I am non-binary, but I present as femme sometimes. Not that I want to, that's just how it is

I appreciate you saying this
When i first came out I tried so hard to look androgynous as a large framed person. 
Eventually I realized I don't owe the world an image to make knowing me easier.
I agree with this so much there is no non-binary “look” hence the point but if people want to be androgynous look wise there is a community for that called r/androgynoushotties there they discuss questions such as do I “look” androgynous
The trend is very annoying, ngl.
Agreed. I’m tired of these posts and the ones asking if their name sounds gendered. I don’t want to focus on gender, I want to think as little about it as possible.
THANK YOU. 

I hate those posts too. I was recently told I can't be enby because I'm too feminine.
Like ok thanks, I just had a baby and I wasn't skinny enough to do physical androgyny in the first place (ever notice how enby fashion only ever seems to have uber skinny white models??) but thanks for erasing me due to factors beyond my control!
Yeah I keep asking myself if I need to find a different sub because I see those so often. They do kinda make me think “oh am I supposed to be aiming for a look?”
I’m so happy that people are addressing this more. I avoided enby spaces for a long time, and it took me a while to even feel comfortable IDing as enby, because of the equation of non-binary identities with androgyny and the expectation that being non-binary had to look a certain way. We’re all just people, and we’re non-binary. That doesn’t come with a certain look because we’re a diverse community and it’s really important to not project our personal experiences onto other people. There is no single valid way to be non-binary.
I DISAGREE.  One CAN look enby.  
They simply must be wearing a froggie hat.  
All jokes aside, I firmly agree.  I'm transmasc but I don't like to bind and a lot of the times the ""do I look enby"" posts are thin and flat chested and... yeah, yeah you do look like what cis people imagine enbys to look like.  But, I don't.  That doesn't make me look less enby.  FeelsBad™️.

Edited because I don't know how Reddit formatting works shhh
I like this. I wore make up once and then some of my friends said something like, “You are finally exptessing yourswlf!” I was like…..since I was assinged male at birth, I guess you assume any male expression is faked, but thst is not true. I love wearing suits. I love tight fitting tshirts (male style). I love being confident while dancing. I have been expressing myself since I was about 16. Granted I do hide some parts of myself, but that does not mean I “finally started expressing” myself when I fo something feminine. Just express myself in a new way.
Louder for the people at the back please. Can we pin this at top of our sub? Can we get sub rules of which this is one? Can we ban the posts that don't understand how counter productive they are being? These posts dominate our sub and push people away
thank you, i needed this.
Thank you for making this post. I am guilty of this mistake myself
THANK YOU
You are 100% correct. None of us owe androgyny. But this knowledge does nothing to take away the pain that I, a large masc-presenting brute, experience at everyday misgendering. No amount of education and no number of pronoun badges has eased my plight. Androgyny is my last resort.
Thank you im glad someone finally said it
Honestly? I needed this today.
THANK YOU! If we are outside of the binary box system, we shouldn't create another box. Fuck the boxes.
Honestly yeah. Some of the validation being sought is validation for the wrong thing.
Thank you 🙏 fr it's toxic
#THANK YOU

And can mods please enforce this?  Remove reported posts that are asking if someone passes/what their AGAB looks like? PLEASE?
110%. Thank you. Somebody enby who is AFAB, uses she pronouns, dresses up in skirts and full makeup every day is JUST AS NONBINARY AS SOMEBODY ANDROGYNOUS. Nonbinary doesn't have a look. You can't 'pass' as nonbinary. Clothes don't have gender. You can't dress more or less nonbinary
Honestly all those posts make me feel unwelcome for whatever reason and invalid. I question if I'm ""enby enough"" because I'm AMAB but identify as agender, but I don't like to wear things to make me look more fem because I'm not fem, I want to be outside of that binary.

I know I don't owe anyone androgyny but coming here and feeling not good enough did drain on my confidence that I am enby.
Thank you.

I've struggled with my enby identity because NOTHING about androgyny sounds appealing to me. I don't want to look androgynous at all. But for years, I believed that meant I wasn't non-binary because I thought ""real"" enby people looked androgynous. It's still something I struggle with. I still spend a lot of time telling myself that I'm not actually enby, because I'm AFAB and like to present as feminine. I doubt that will ever go completely away, but hearing and seeing people talk less about ""looking non-binary"" certainly wouldn't go unappreciated.
This. I don’t want to look more “nonbinary.” I just want to look less feminine.
Peole need to know that r/androgynous exists too
Would “Look how androgynous I look today!” be fine?
This. Yes.
I'm gonna link this post from now on
Agreed! Literally said the same thing yesterday in this same sub. Can we please stop replicating the cissexual idea of looking gendered?
Thank you!! I actually messaged the mods about this yesterday, hopefully they listen soon!!
As high femme nb ty
capital B Based
posts like that do make me sad
This!!!!
Thank you for saying exactly what I feel. I’ve been going to an lgbtq+ support group and saying exactly this every week! How I feel imposter phenomenon because I don’t always look androgynous, but that these feelings are wrong because it doesn’t matter what I look like to others, it matters how I feel about myself. Thank you again!
This post should be pinned
It gives ""you don't look trans"" /  ""you're pretty for a trans person"" / ""you're pretty for a black girl"" / ""you don't look autistic"" vibes.
Thank you! Even with hormones, I can't change my facial structure or body shape, so those posts feel invalidating, especially to a POC.
I agree with saying that an outfit makes someone feel good/pretty/whatever is a better way to phrase it.
You’re looking for r/nonbinaryover30 mi amor. The kids are still working on it.
Agreed
YES. THANK YOU.
So this. I have no non offensive way to describe my physical features.  I am short have a very curvy butt and large breasts.  I am not a woman but I am in that I share a lot of common experiences.  People assume I’m cisgender all the time. It’s frustrating. Because I constantly have to educate people and it takes a lot of energy. 

I am agender.  So under the umbrella trans-gender, not binary. , agender. It’s the closet fitting box. 

I literally had a women in transition berate be in this private group chat because she didn’t believe that non-binary folks being ignored in the sports world in terms of classification. She thought that “female gender based division doesn’t make me feel like I don’t belong because I don’t have a gender.

I had to leave the group and said some hurtful things which I regret. But I was so taken off guard because it was such a safe space. 

The original post was a lovely post that while a lot of the group were woman there where also non-binary folks who were part of and while we support them we don’t want to be erased. I
Everything about this!

I've been considering leaving this sub because all of those post really trigger my dysphoria and make me question if I'm ""really nonbinary enough"" because I am so femme presenting most of the time.
Thank youuuu!! I am not androgynous like at all. I would never be confused for a dude. It honestly sucks so much seeing people asking about this constantly and acting like being androgynous is the only way you can be nonbinary. We're all enby. Idc if you have massive boobs or a beard and chest hair. Idc if you like to wear tight tops and skirts or oversized jeans and hoodies. There's not a certain look you should have for people to respect you and use your pronouns. Honestly this sub makes me feel more insecure in my identity than anything has before. Be androgynous if that's you I'm so happy for you. But it's not me. It's not so many of us. I'm not gonna try fit myself into a tiny box right in between the male-female binary just so people respect me.
The idea of passing is toxic to begin with, even for binary trans people. It comes from a culture of “clocking” trans people and it just sucks. Plain and simple.
It sounds what people might be looking for is a ""vibe check"", which is probably a better way to phrase it than ""do I look androgynous/enby"".
This! Also the posts that are like “would you assume I’m AMAB or AFAB?” I just scroll by because I know they’re looking for affirmations but it really annoys me because your sex assigned at birth has nothing to do with being non-binary.
The purely aesthetic thing with the non-binary world is so fucking irritating. For some people that’s really all it is
That's the thing about passing. Because of the gender binary as a social structure, people will *try* to categorize everyone as one thing or another. Now, one could be in a position where people find it actively harder to categorize, but that is *because* they're *attempting* to do so. And when we talk about passing, that is the dynamic we're talking about. So I agree, it is kind of impossible to *'pass'* as nonbinary.

Slightly separate, but linked; as you say, there is no such thing as 'looking nonbinary', just as there is no such thing as 'looking gay'. If you are, then you are.
Mods sticky this pleeeease
Passing discussion always just ends up uplifting cis-het standards of how people are allowed to appear. Always gives me a bit of ""am I pleasing my oppressors"" vibe even when the question is ""Do I look neither male nor female?""

Not to mention how these kinds of post denigrate folks who can't or don't want to ""pass.""
Absolutely agree, you can identify as non-binary and dress however you like. 

You don't have to ""pass"" as anything other than your own authentic self.
Yes! THANK YOU! I can not upvote this enough.
Thank you for saying this, it was all I was seeing lol. I know for some people it's just something they're not aware of yet and maybe think the terms are interchangable and it's not their fault really, but it was getting very much.
I aim to look androgynous over non binary.  

I’m okay looking either male or female most days- but some days I want to look like neither and both at the same time. I enjoy diverse fashion and I want to look masculine sometimes and feminine others. It’s different for everyone. I consider myself non binary but I still prefer the pronoun she. I do get happy when people call me he on mistake though. It means I’m coming across the way I want to.
Thank you for saying that. I’m afab and with my height and figure I’ll always be perceived feminine and if I tried to force an androgynous look, I would at most look like a young boy, which I don’t want. Like, I’d love to look androgynous but the way I want it isn’t achievable for me so I’m just… mostly sticking to very basic clothing and everyone assumes I’m a woman 🤷
Its true that as a Nonbinary person there is no such thing as passing when you can dress as you please. I've also saw someone post a reddit for these kinds of things if people want to ask. 

Other than that as you said if they are asking I think it's a form of feedback especially if you're going for a certain look.
thank you for saying this. 💕

in other non-binary subs, people have - completely unprompted - told me how to change my body to fit their standards. & i do understand why they do that: my body is so lacking in traditional androgyny, it’d drive people absolutely wild to be forced to live in it. *i’m* not having a great time living in it.

but i don’t understand why people push a whole different set of standards instead of realizing that the standards are, in fact, the problem. it’s impossible for my body to obtain traditional androgyny: maybe the definition of traditional androgyny is the problem. maybe being androgynous being the only way to exist as non-binary in this world is the problem. maybe nobody’s body is the fucking problem.
Thank you this is very frustrating for me. I’m afab and I will always have curves but that doesn’t make me ANY less non-binary.
I think the discussion about passing as a binary man or woman is valid cause that can be about safety as much as it is about easing dysphoria. But I fear passing as nonbianary might make it seem like a solid third gender instead of the umbrella term it is. We can celebrate how presentation and even flagging give us gender euphoria but there's as many ways to ""look nonbianary"" as there are nonbianary people.
if i could upvote this 100x i would. it’s so annoying, i’ve considered leaving the forum bcs it’s constant posts like that. you look like a human in clothes, that’s it.
Facts. I’ve been seeing so many of these posts and every time I think 


“Do y’all not get it?”
THIS!!!! I adore the pics of people feeling good or trying out something new and looking for validation, or anyone who just wants to share a selfie :) it’s great seeing people in our community! I love y’all!

But please don’t ask about Passing unless you need help looking like a “cis” person for safety or something.

Always happy to help people asking how to look more masc/fem/androgynous etc. That’s absolutely fine! It’s a great way to find tips on reducing our dysphoria and making us feel happier! I always want you to be happier! (Yes, you reading this!).

If you don’t feel “nonbinary enough” that’s okay. I don’t most days either. It doesn’t mean anything bad. It doesn’t mean you aren’t valid. It means society is pushing us so many directions and we are trying to find out how best to express ourselves, be healthy and safe. Please just say you are feeling unsure or want to know if you are valid (you are! But it’s okay to ask that if you need to hear it!).

TL;DR: you are valid and great just how you are. But if you want specific advice or support, say so xxx
I really like the ""look how enby I look today"" posts because everybody looks so different.
You said it. This is why the term nonbinary exists in the first place. It’s literally a category so you don’t HAVE to fall into a gender category. Nonbinary is like a free space in a bingo game, or a free choice activity for art class. Anything you want. Anything YOU want.

If you are more feminine and want to present feminine features, go for it! You are not less valid or more valid than someone who chooses to present as androgynous.

If you want to present as androgynous, your presentation is not ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ because as nonbinary, you do not fit into binary gender constructs, and therefore don’t fit into one certain appearance to represent all.

My point is that, just do what makes you happy. Dress, act, talk, feel the way you want. You are not right or wrong. Stay safe, all.

- Kíeran, he/him (I still like this sub because identifying as nb for years was a big part of my identity, and I like to honor it. I also like complimenting people lol. And, my partner is nb, even though I’ma trans guy)
But we can still ask if we pass as androgynous, correct? It's really important for some of us.
thx!! the concept of ""passing"" as nonbinary has lowkey hurt me as an afab demigirl, bc it makez me feel like i can NEVER be even remotely fem/be ok with fem language or my identity wont be valid anymore and i wont be TRULY nonbinary, which is just absolute bullcrap. to me, skirts and shorts are just pieces of fabric and pinks and blues are just colors so idc abt fitting my presentation into a box, i just dress how i want and look how i want and ive gotta remind myself that doesnt make me ""less nonbinary"" or whatevr <3
This is right up there with referring to people as they/thems. There's already a gender neutral term for people that is not men or women. It's people/person. There's no need to make up a new word that plays off some non-binary people using they/them pronouns.
For myself it's a huge thing to also look more androgynous/masc-leaning/whatever. 🤷🏻‍♂️ I can't speak for others, but in my daily life I still get 85-95% of the time misgendered and I made a post a few days ago cause I really started to question my looks and efforts.

Some people have a drive to bring inner stuff to the outside. Like I also have some tattoos of the, for me, most important things. Like I have a tattoo for the people I lost in my life, but not everyone could think about getting a tattoo. Not only cause you have to find someone who is really able to do what you like, also some people just can't think of showing important things like that around.

In my native language and location you for example have no kind of ""they/them"". So I, as a patient with multiple chronic diseases, has every time to tell the docs to call me by chosen first name (extremely uncommon to do this, it's only ok if you are really familiar) and the formal use of ""you"".

Even if I do this, I still get all the time misgendered everywhere.

That is something that makes ME very dysphoric.

That's why I asked here, how others here would see me, cause I needed outside opinions.

I think the most others who post similar questions like how good they ""pass"" or what others think, is born out of similar issues.

Maybe that helps understanding a bit more both sides.
This is a very good point, but the same can be said if a trans men was to make a post asking ""do I pass as a man?. That's not invalidating trans men who don't wish or can't ""pass"" as a man. Getting called ""she, miss, young lady"" kills me. I can't reach into people's minds and scream ""I'm fucking nonbinary!!"" So I want something, anything about my outward appearance that can other people see that will get me gendered correctly.
As long as we’re ranting in here … wow I would love it if I could go ONE day without being bombarded with binary affirmations / celebrations / references here in the NONBINARY sub!

“Gender euphoria because I look so masculine today!” I … okay? Great? I’m happy for you, but … is this remotely on topic? “My partner called me her girlfriend and it was amazing!” Again … love it, I celebrate and elevate you, but in what possible way is that nonbinary?!?!

I struggle because gatekeeping is a shitty thing to do, but come on, this feels to me like going into the Skyrim sub and talking about how much you love Elden Ring, and it’s just CONSTANT in this sub!

</rant>, thanks for listening, and feel free to let me know if I’m thinking about this wrong, I’m open to feedback and learning
[deleted]
People want to look distinct from the men and women in their lives and that's valid actually. They're not asking for the one true enby form, and it's actually not very empathetic or nice to project that onto people. It's okay to care about how you're perceived and if you don't suffer from dysphoria, congrats, some people do tho and it's worth contemplating whether ""just look like how you want to"" is actually going to make someone feel better or not.

If you've spent your life only knowing what you're not, someone telling you you're heccin valid just do whatever kinda sucks!
Yeah… I dunno, “dressing in a way that validates you” and “signaling that you are non-binary with style choices” and “passing” are all kinda the same thing. Isn’t “I love how this clothing makes me feel about myself” just the subtext of a phrase like “Look how enby I look today?” Idk, I think for some (not all) playing with the ambiguities of everything is really enjoyable.

Like I pass as enby in the sense that when I meet new ppl out in the world I will sometimes be asked my pronouns (no one else will be asked this question) and when they assume, they go they/them. Ppl see my style and appearance and assume something about me.

That’s just passing no?
Stop gatekeeping and telling people the rules. There aren’t rules. People get to live their lives the way they want and you don’t get a say in it. We’ve been fighting too damn long to get other people to stop telling us how to live into our true selves to just let another group of people start telling us how to live.
I personally view social acceptance of your non-binary identity to be rooted in ""failing"" rather than ""passing"". When people who don't know are no longer reading you as either binary gender I'd consider you to do the non-binary equivalent of passing.
IS EVERY SOCIAL MEDIA CALLING ME OUT TONIGHT WTF?
[deleted]
I think a lot of it just comes from a mix of insecurity and still struggling to re-wire the brain to think of gender differently than how it is treated in the cis world. Ik it can suck to see bc the person clearly isnt really understanding a lot about what gender actually is, but I think it’s important to keep in mind that we’re all in different places of our gender journey and a lot of people are still learning and growing and becoming more comfortable. 
I think we as a community need to be careful how we treat other non-binary people who are still figuring themselves out and de-programming their way of thinking. It should be more of a priority to help our fellows than automatically get mad at them, even if it can be frustrating.
There was a post about this about two weeks ago, and it made me so happy at the time to see that other people had a similar opinion to me on this (it had several thousand upvotes). 

And then... Nothing was really done about it. I thought that maybe it would be added as one of the rules of the sub that you couldn't make those sorts of posts, because so many people were sick of them and commented saying so. But, nothing.

I was actually considering leaving this sub for exactly the reasons you mentioned until your post. I might hang around a little longer and see if things do change. If they don't, I guess I'll leave.

Edit: apologies, it was about 'what gender do I look?', not 'do I look enby?'. Both problematic questions tbh,  and ones it's clear many people here are sick of. https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/z0zyam/the_what_gender_do_you_assume_i_am_posts_need_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
Thank you. I know that there is supposedly an authentic look. I hate that there is an unspoken measurement. I'm nonbinary every day. My androgyny is innate. I don't have to wear it I'd perform it. It's not an aesthetic. It's in my spirit.
I agree. It makes me feel like I’m not nonbinary enough because I have long hair and look more feminine. Nonbinary shouldn’t have rules or certain ways to look. It makes no sense.
It is very very wrong but I don’t fault people thinking that they need to pass some kind of test for being non-binary Given that in every other group there seems to be some kind of criteria about how you need to be to do X otherwise you’re not  y enough. it is incorrect But not surprising to imagine that people think that it’s the same for this. What didn’t seem to get is the non-binary by its very definition Abandoned notion of traditional gender roles or even criteria in general. You are what you are because you say you are. You could be the most masculine Scottish highland games type man but not feel like that inside and if he were to Declared that he was non-binary he would be. People need to understand that it’s all about self affirmation and acceptance not the acceptance of people that somehow think it’s necessary to clamp criteria on something that by its very existence is criteria less
YW
Thanks I honestly needed to hear that
I appreciate the positivity of this post. However, I understand where people may be coming from with asking if they ""pass as nb"", because I've literally been asked ""how can you be non-binary with a big chest"" and also nobody at work can get my pronouns right even though I wear a pronoun pin AND we've had work meetings about it AND I correct them, they always want to address me as my AGAB. While how I've learned into my identity is what makes me comfortable, a v small part of it is also so people actually respect and remember and identify that I am nb 😞
Anyone who asks me if the pass from now on is only ever going to get a yes and aggressve support from me when others disagree.
The idea of passing and the standards set for passing are standards set by people who aren't even queer or trans.
Enough is enough. Let's set our own standards 💕
LOUDER FOR THE PEOPLE IN THE BACK
why limit it to enbys? it's less obvious but technically nobody passes as a woman or man either.
And not to mention the privilege that comes with being able to look androgynous in the first place
> is a huge step backwards in a community where we’re trying to show the world that anyone of any gender (or lack thereof) can and should express themselves however they want!

Preach 🙌🏽
Yessss like ik society loves boxes but why does it have to be a hierarchy? I dress more femme but it doesn't change how I feel about my gender.
I completely agree with this my androgyny is from my dysphoria non from me being non binary.
It’s so sad and wrong that you get told that. There is no way to “look nonbinary” so I’m sorry you have to hear such invalidating stuff all the time. I support you! Enbies can and should present in any way that makes them feel the best! And so should binary people for that matter!
100% yes
Cultural context speaks to another awkward aspect of this which is the appeal to the dominant cultural ideas of androgeny. Thin and white, to put it bluntly. It's not intentional, I know. But we should be better than not racist, we should be anti-racist: that means we face down our unconscious biases fearlessly and without getting defensive.

Let's play with gender norms freely, but not create new ones with which to police bodies.

With love to all my enby community!
Yes! Personally people gender me maybe 70% fem 30% masc and I'm sure that almost nobody see me and thinks ""oh an agender one"". We learned to put a gender to everyone so people do that automatically
>intentionally presenting mixed gender cues,

this is what a i personally prefer. realistically i am never going to be 50/50 androgynous so id rather go full genderfuck.
I can't imagine that you mean it's *impossible* to look androgynous in exactly the way you've described: causing great difficulty in guessing your AGAB.
I'd encourage people to ponder the difference between gender expression and gender perception as well. How other people interpret your expression can be at times (frustratingly) more consequential than your expression itself. It's an unpleasant reality that it breaks my heart to see queer people still facing despite how far society has come.
All posts where people are asking how others perceive them should be banned, to be honest because A: our perception is not going to be representative of the rest of the mostly cishet world and B: it's all grounded in stereotypes

It's not useful and is potentially quite upsetting. There should be a separate subreddit for it if people want feedback on their gender presentation
I second the idea about adding it to the rules !
I can relate! I was thinking this too!
Really well said
I really love the sub r/NonBinaryTalk for this reason ❤️
I agree about the “do I look [gender]” posts, but not selfies in general. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to share your look with people you should be able to expect to not judge you based on gender conformance. 

Yes, it’s validation-seeking, but some of us need a little bit of that from the online community because we don’t have access to any IRL support. 

I don’t begrudge anyone the need for validation. I think we *do* need to redirect what people are looking to have validated.
Yea no, with the amount of queerphobia in the world, we shouldn't be banning trans people from posting selfies. And there's nothing wrong with I th seeking validation if it's something you can't get easily irl
This 👆🏽 for me too ❤️
This 🙌🏽
I feel like its more for advice when asking though. If you want a certain look I think its fine to ask and give advice.

Then there are subreddits for that if asking.
Post on r/transpassing for posts like the person is describing
Yes because androgynous is a word that can be used as a descriptor of physical appearance, nonbinary cannot be used in that same way.
Also, stop asking people to name you!

A name should be personal, not the result of a Reddit thread.
Thank you for this.
Yes this! I honestly hate seeing any AMAB v AFAB discussions and tend to leave or mute a group when I see them. We’re all nonbinary, right? Why the focus on what’s in our pants when we know that it feels gross when the outside world is already so caught up about it.
Well said 🙌🏽
That would be fine.
I feel this. I'm not ok with fem language for myself it makes me feel squicky but 100% same for me otherwise
Im sure its more for advice. I think it's fine if people ask if certain clothing styles or whatever look they are going for would help.
Then make a post saying “do I look androgynous/masc” not “do I look non-binary”, that’s all the post was saying.
day 284829 of people mistaking gender identity for expression
You are in fact thinking about this the wrong way. Nonbinary doesn’t mean genderless. Nonbinary is an umbrella term that encompasses anyone who does not feel 100% man or 100% woman. Enbies can have no gender, multiple genders, etc. There’s no right way to be nonbinary. Nonbinary people can get euphoria from gendered terms. There are trans masculine enbies and trans feminine enbies, there are enbies who are both men and women (me), and sometimes it makes us euphoric to hear ourselves referred to in binary terms. I love being called boyfriend but that doesn’t make me less nonbinary. Your comment does come across as gatekeepy because, again, there is no right or wrong way to be nonbinary. Being nonbinary means something different to every enby.
I mean, there are nonbinary men and nonbinary women. Nonbinary doesn't just mean ""genderless"". So, posts about how happy someone is that were able to express their nonbinary gender are not out of place here.

Edit: actually, fuck it, I *hate* how hostile this place can be to literally anyone who is not 100% androgynous all the time. I'm nonbinary. I'm a dude. I like being masculine. I like being called ""husband"" and ""brother"". That makes me feel good, *because i am a nonbinary guy*. And it really, really feels like this place, which is supposed to be *for all nonbinary people* count me as a traitor to be kept out of this space. 

Which, fine. I don't have the fucking energy for this anymore. If you think I, a NONBINARY person, should be gatekept out of NONBINARY spaces I'll show myself out.
You really misread the post huh. OP isn’t trying to dictate how people look or stop them from looking androgynous, what they’re saying is that people saying “Do I look nonbinary” when they mean “do I look androgynous” can be harmful, as it implies that nonbinary=androgyny, when nonbinary people can actually look however they want and not just androgynous.
That’s not what OP is saying. This is about people using nonbinary when they mean androgynous. When someone is looking for validation in how they look they can say something like “do i look androgynous?” or any other descriptor. The issue here is that nonbinary is not an adjective that can describe physical appearance and when you use it like it is one, it’s very invalidating to nonbinary people who don’t fit that mold. 

OP isn’t saying “you’re valid, do whatever” they’re saying “you’re valid, do what feels right for YOU” they’re saying that there shouldn’t be any sort of expectation for how an enby “should” look because we can look any sort of way, same with binary people. 


It’s sort of like how a woman who is trying to look feminine shouldn’t say “do i look like a woman?” Because women can look any sort of way, masculine, feminine, androgynous, etc. What she should ask is “do i look feminine?” Because that’s not invalidating to the women who don’t look feminine.
Of course it’s valid, that’s not what I’m saying here
""look how enby I look today"" implies that *a specific look is nonbinary* and that *everyone who doesn't look like that doesn't look nonbinary*. ""This clothing makes my gender feel good"" doesn't do that.
Read the other comments in this thread to see why you’re looking at this the wrong way. I don’t feel like typing out a bunch of stuff again.
You can't really 'pass' as enby since there is no single way to present among all enbys. Some enbys are agender, some are multigenger, some are fluid, some are closer to one side of the binary than the other. All of those are very different. And even among the same gender identity people might want to present differently
I agree, but this is missing the point…
The entire concept of “passing” is based in binary gender norms.
saying 'not all non binary people present the same way and implying so is invalidating and bigoted' is not saying 'non binary people don't experience dysphoria'
Did you just try to pit people who dress androgynous and people who don't against each other?  We are all here because we identify or are questioning being non-binary. Nobody said androgynous dressing people are bad or have any other sort of ranking within this community.

The FACT of the matter is one's gender identity does not dictate how one should dress or look. Period.  Personally, I think using verbiage that correlates the two is harmful in any way that it's used.  I shouldn't feel like I'm ""doing it wrong"" or that my acquaintances are going to wonder if I'm ""faking it"" because I was AFAB and decided to wear a skirt today.
> there are some non-binary people where androgyny is the only cure for dysphoria

Then they're welcome to ask /r/androgyny how well they're pulling it off. While there's correlation between angrogyny and nonbinary people, it's not inherently linked. And frankly, it's taken me a lot longer to internalise this _precisely because_ of the number of people who post androgynous selfies here — impostor syndrome is a bitch.
A lot of people with that type of insecurity will see posts like this or overly-critical comments on their post and automatically want to hide away and disengage in the community. Which is really sad to me
i’m FINALLY being perceived as more androgynous to people now, but it took over a year of T and mostly my new mullet to make that happen. and i’m still perceived more as a girl than anything else, just an uptick of “are you a boy or a girl” question has happened in the past month
thank you
Yep. I dress almost exclusively in men's clothes but have a very feminine body shape so I read as feminine anyways.
Tbh I disagree with this sentiment. Being seen as androgynous is typically not a privilege, even if it’s gender affirming. Gender non conforming people are generally not treated very well by the general public I’ve found
I wouldn’t consider it a privilege cuz anyone can look androgynous if they try hard enough, just like how anyone can look more femme if they want to
My hero of the day
Right? Like, I'm a fat person. I'm not going to be gendered androgynously pretty much ever because people in the western world largely think it means 'thin white afab person with jaw-length hair'.
Androgyny is culturally relative for sure, because masculinity and femininity are likewise culturally relative. I'd most likely be considered far more androgynous in certain other cultures than in my own. Other cultures would see me as more masculine, because the feminine side of me isn't considered feminine there. Paradoxically this is both incredibly affirming and deeply soul-crushing.
Wait, I don't really get it, can you explain in more detail? 

There are PoC that look feminine, there are PoC that look masculine, why do you say that they can't look andro? /gen
I don't think that it's strictly impossible in the sense that it's never something any individual has been able to do - there are a lot of people in the world and I'm sure that a small percentage of manage it.

However, I feel like aiming for it is like aiming for the edge of a knife; most of the time you're going to end up on one side or the other. Even in situations where someone isn't sure about someone's gender, most cis people in my experience seem to prefer to just assume one or the other and hope for the best, so the end result is that you get read 50/50 rather than being read specifically as androgynous. They might recognize that you're a fairly androgynous person, but they'll still decide that you're an androgynous woman or an androgynous man.

This is because there's less of a social construct for non-binary people and what we look like, and what is there is primarily only for thin white afab people and therefore ends up contributing to the idea that non-binary people are just women-lite.

I point this out because I feel like attempting to fit into that small stereotyped and fairly privileged space to get read as non-binary in a few specific queer friendly cities is going to be a pretty difficult goal for most people, and I think if people are going to aim for that they should have realistic expectations.
honestly yeah this.

as much as i despise the concept of ""passing"" (even the NAME is so degrading), i cant ignore the fact that knowing how others read you can be important for ones safety in some situations/environments.
BUT. i agree that this really isnt the place for it, for exactly the reasons youve stated. all it does in an environment like this is cause harm.
why not here?
I don’t think I’ve ever phrased it that way, but thank you :)
As I said, I can only talk for myself^^

But for me it is very important to not look as my AGAB, cause it's really bothering me.

I have for example more curves than I would like, thanks to stuff like lipoedema. One day I will have to get Liposuction for it, although I know, that it's the second deadliest ""beauty"" surgery after BBL.

So from my point of view it's totally ok if someone needs opinions from others, who can more likely feel the struggle.
If you would have looked into my post, you would have seen, that I asked is I look masc-leaning to others.

Maybe try to read, BEFORE trying to smartass someone 🙄
Yeah, I fucked up. I apologize.
Similarly, ""they"" isn't ***the*** non-binary pronoun. There is no non-binary pronoun.

Any gender or non-gender can self-refer as they. 

And, a non-binary person can go by any pronoun. Even their AGAB. It's valid.
Very sincere thanks for the reply, I appreciate it. That helps a lot, I can see where I was making some big misunderstandings and assumptions. I have some more listening to do.
Yeah, your identity is valid and so is your frustration and anger at my ignorance. You absolutely belong here and now I think I’m the one who doesn’t. I didn’t understand what I was talking about and I apologize.
""you can't look enby"" great good love it very nice upvoteupvoteupvote

like come on. People can have their own understanding of femininity, but the average person is going to be _pretty good_ at estimating whether a stranger will gender a particular person as female or not. And I'm _struggling_ to understand how yalls aren't reducing their struggle to ""actually they should stop caring 🙃"" Doh! Why didn't! They think of that! Of course , we solved gender!

It would be great if gender were cordoned off into your own personal feelings but it isn't, _other people's understanding of gender matters to us_ whether we want it to or not.
My assumption is that you believe ""do i pass as non-binary"" is invalid. Like the understandable knee jerk reaction is that it's encouraging some form of gatekeeping but it feels a lot more complex than that
I feel like “this clothing makes my gender feel good” is a really… weird way of phrasing it tbh. “this clothing gives me gender euphoria” would be a better way of saying that one I think
Does it? Or is that just what you hear?
You know I did and I wasn’t convinced.
I agree, but only to an extent. ""Passing"" is a phenomenon that applies beyond just gender. It is a state of being in which how others perceive you is aligned to how you express yourself, and it's something we perpetually do unless we truly do not care about the perception of others. Few people can sincerely claim not to care about passing in some way or another, be that in regards to gender or something else.
I wish this would happen to me. All anyone sees is a boy and I have to present masc at work (conservative industry).
I feel like its hardly possible to be consistently considered androgynous. Once my face changed enough from T I'm treated as a guy. If I tie my hair back I'm stared at as a girl. People generally just pick one. I think its better to just try to get more people to stop assuming one or the other, and not feel weird if people are cautiously neutral.
I never said they had privilege in the way of being accepted into hegemonic gender norms, I’m saying that generally speaking in order to present androgynously, it requires access to more clothes, makeup, accessories, surgeries, etc etc to be read as “confusing” to most people which is in of itself, a privilege. 

When it comes to the privilege of partaking in hegemony, of course androgynous people don’t have that privilege, but having access to enough capital to present as they see fit, is a privilege many don’t have.
Not everyone can look androgynous. Stop blaming those of us who want to but can't for ""not trying hard enough"".
hard disagree.

i have a very hyper-female body shape, to the point where people ask if i have had plastic surgery or have some sorta estrogen disorder.

i have talked to multiple doctors: if i lost enough weight to be skinny enough to have an “androgynous” body shape (ie, no curves, bc that’s how mainstream society thinks about it), i’d actually die. i’d have to be so underweight that my body would fail.

so no, not everyone can have a “stereotypically androgynous” body - which is why we (in my opinion) need to expand the definition of androgyny to be more inclusive. people that identify with that word shouldn’t be excluded bc of how they look, regardless of gender identity or sex assigned at birth.
Yeah I could easily pass as AMAB in terms of build if I just didn’t have wide hips, which I mostly gave because of my weight (not huge, def not skinny). Because of that and my round (also from weight) face, I’m stuck getting misgendered.
It's not particular to androgeny. For someone to talk about whether they ""look X"" we are defining X and that calls on cultural norms. The dominant culture is white European, so that has a lot of gravity in all gender expressions.

Serena Williams is sometimes described in masculine terms, or be told she was born male. This is racist culture policing a PoC woman's body.

All bodies are policed, all genders of all ethnicities are policed, as a community we have the opportunity to not build up new ideals but celebrate all bodies.

Which I think many people do! Our community is wonderful! It's just something to watch ourselves for because unconscious bias is powerful.
I don't think they meant PoC can't look andro. When people on this sub speak of looking andro, they often have a particular ideal in mind that is informed by cultural, unconscious bias. Just look at the ref names that constantly come up for ""peak androgyny"" (like Bowie and Swinton).
Oh for sure. Most cis-het people probably have two drawers they can sort you into, and they'll only let someone sit on the countertop for so long until they decide where to put you. But even just the initial confusion would mean androgyny had been achieved IMO
no seriously what’s wrong with posting selfies here? Is it bad?
Reread the beginning of your comment and tell me again that I read it wrong.

That’s on you bro.
Yep! Pronouns are a form of gender expression and gender expression is not the same thing as gender! 

I go by they/he but i feel like i’m just as much of a woman as i am a man. They/he just feels better than they/he/she right now for me.
I appreciate you listening! We all have room to grow and learn, that’s what this community is for!
You’re misunderstanding me entirely. I’m not saying that people should ignore their dysphoria or “stop caring” about how they look or are perceived. I’m saying we need to stop conflating a certain look with being nonbinary because it really sucks for the nonbinary people who don’t have THAT look. 

Listen, other people’s understanding of gender *does* tend to matter to us, **and that’s why what I’m saying is so important**. As a community, we should not want society to equate androgyny with being nonbinary because that really really sucks for two major groups of people: non-androgynous enbies, and androgynous binary people. And it also gives people the complete wrong idea about what nonbinary means! Being nonbinary means something different to every single enby. The concept of passing is increasingly harmful to our community. 

No one is saying that people shouldn’t seek to have the presentation that makes them feel good, no one is saying that people can’t come here for validation, we’re saying stop using nonbinary as a physical descriptor when it isn’t one. Use terms that are more accurate so that you don’t alienate a huge portion of this community by making them feel like they’re not “nonbinary enough” just because they aren’t or don’t want to be androgynous!
No, it is of course more complex. My point is only that while I can empathize with the (likely painful) reasons why someone is asking that question, it also demonstrates that they are unaware of the pain that ripples out into a community beyond themselves by asking it. Evidenced by some of the other comments here including one where they feel like they can't be here anymore because those posts hurt too much.
That’s a matter of semantics because both statements you mention are saying the exact same thing if it is the clothing giving a person gender euphoria, the clothing *is* making their gender feel good. We should avoid policing how people express their satisfaction with their gender.
You read all the comments of people being like yeah these types of posts make me feel super excluded and alienated from this community? You don’t think that’s a bad thing? To alienate and exclude other enbies from our community.
If the question is based on appearance and vibes (feminine, masculine, androgynous, punk, cottagecore, or anything descriptive of a vibe) then it’s not based on gender. 

If you’re asking if you look like a man, woman, or non-binary, there are NO descriptors attached to those categories. The only metrics that exist are rooted in gender norms. 

I get that the majority of people assume gender based on appearance, but isn’t the goal to move away from that? Can’t women be masculine and men be feminine without their gender being assumed?
I feel you there completely mate. I have facial hair that particularly gives disphoria for me but it grows so fast that I can’t even bother sometimes.
If I dont know pronouns, i always use ‘they’ until I’m corrected and thats how I’m gonna keep doing it.
I agree with where you’re coming from, but I don’t think I agree that being androgynous requires money or privilege. Some of the most disenfranchised people in the world are poor trans women, who are often read as androgynous or gender ambiguous. 

We may be using different definitions of androgyny here. If you mean “someone who you cannot tell the gender of”, I agree that’s a pretty hard thing to do. Most people “pass” as either male or female, and it does require a lot of effort to be read as totally neutral in your presentation. 

I tend to think of androgyny as a combination of masculinity and femininity, which can be achieved by almost everyone. Tbh “a combination of masculinity and femininity” is the place a lot of “non passing” trans people find themselves, often not by choice. 

Let me know if I’m missing any part of your point here, I’m mostly operating from my own experience as a trans person who is perceived as androgynous most of the time
Woah there relax, I never once said I blame those who want to but “can’t” I’m just saying anyone can be androgynous just like anyone can be feminine. Just because someone doesn’t “pass” doesn’t mean they aren’t androgynous. A lot of people who are androgynous still get misgendered such as myself
Oh my god trying to dress more masc with my giant hips is a nightmare. I don't even necessarily want to be read as masculine but like sometimes I'd like to be read as slightly less feminine.
Well put!
I just talked over the post I did as a standalone. Cause the whole post here is ranting over others and it's just tiring.

Instead of talking to each other and try to reason, WHY someone thinks something excluding or whatever some people (and it seems like not a minority) more love to hate and rant about others, although we are a friggin minority in this world, as far as I know.

And again, it seems like you didn't take a look in a profile, you just tried to invalidate my experience and my kind of speech (hey, I'm not a native English speaker).

So, please go away and hate on others, I have better things to do.

You can come back after maturing and being able to have a proper talk.
>I go by they/he but i feel like i’m just as much of a woman as i am a man. They/he just feels better than they/he/she right now for me.

Yeah, thank goodness there's no need to restrict oneself. Wouldn't it be horrifying to feel uncomfortable with one's pronoun, but because of no alternative, be all ""okay this is my life now ***\*suffers\****""
fair, I feel like I only see posts asking for help and people not getting it but I don't see everything idk.
sure, but I don’t think the former is how anyone would ever refer to it
This. Keeping up with it has pushed me over the edge to when I can’t keep up it starts pushing me into self-harm ideation territory where I’m actually afraid I’m going to do something stupid while shaving, have a meltdown, then do something really incredibly fucking stupid.

Thankfully I’m going to start laser soon cause I’ve had enough of this negative feedback emotional shit.
I do that too. Hoping to normalize to people around me by just doing it alot.
Isn’t that just correct grammar?
We aren’t talking about binary trans people, we are talking about non-binary people. Androgyny as a “passing” goal, or as an aesthetic criterion that non-binary people must conform to or not be considered non-binary is a stance that comes from privilege.
I mean, I'm a very short very curvy AFAB human that rocks long hair I wont cut because it's culturally important to me. I'd love to know this secret way of being androgynous, cause it has literally never been my lived experience - despite flannel shirts, binders, or like...grilling while talking about nascar (lol, for real tho). I have never not been assumed to be my AGAB.

If there's a secret I'm missing someone please let a brother know.
No, you said anyone can ""look androgynous if they try hard enough"", which is simply not true. Pray tell me how am I supposed to look androgynous without the ability to wear binders or make-up, when I'm still automatically assumed to be female even with a buzz cut and wide, baggy clothes?

Yes, it is a privilege.
What the hell are you talking about
Also fair, I agree that helping and looking out for each other in this community is the #1 goal
Same here.
Yes. The other valid option is asking the person their pronouns, but sometimes people dont want to be asked their pronouns. All around, just using they until corrected seems like the appropriate answer.
I guess I don't see a huge distinction between binary and non-binary trans people in this context. There are non-binary people who medically transition (myself being one of them) and there are binary trans people who never medically transition. I think binary and non-binary trans people have more in common between the two groups than within either group, if that makes sense. There is so much diversity in the trans community that I find markers like ""binary"" and ""non-binary"" sort of immaterial. 

I agree with you that it's wrong to hold any trans person to any standards of ""passing."" I've found that in non-binary communities there is a very specific type of androgyny that is rewarded (white, thin, masculine-adjacent afab people) and any other type of androgyny is not really celebrated in the same way. I think this has more to do with white supremacy and transmisogyny than an actual acceptance of androgyny or gender nonconformity.

I think the idea that non-binary people should be expected to fit this standard comes from privilege, but I don't think that even most androgynous people fit this standard. There are a million ways to be androgynous, that's why I brought up ""non-passing"" trans people as an example of androgyny that most people aren't being pressured to emulate.
For me, also a curvy AFAB, it helped throwing out like 70% of my clothing. Skirts, dresses, very femme tops,... I sold it on Vinted.

Instead now I am wearing a more classy male style, what was a solution for me, cause I liked this kind of style before, but I totally get if not everyone feels like that.

But a big thing for me was chopping of my hair, cause it changes the looks of the face. 🤷🏻‍♂️ But I totally get you, when you say you don't want to get rid of it (and I always envied people with really long, nice hair, cause I could only grow it max to half my back 😬 and it didn't suit me...)

I had/have the ""advantage"" that my face is cut more androgynous or how my hubby would say ""German"" 😅😂

But I also have enough stuff there I have a problem with, cause it doesn't look like I want ^^'
There is no “secret” way and I’m sorry you have not had a good experience!
I can imagine how frustrating that is, I’m sorry you have had to deal with that
This just validated my point, thank you, I'm out.
Right, I think the idea that anyone should be pressured to fit an aesthetic goal comes from privilege relating to the things that you described, transmisogyny, white supremacy. 

I know it’s anecdotal but I have been told in my experience that I can’t be enby because I grow facial hair, and yes I too have noticed the masc adjacent androgyny. I suppose what I’m trying to say is that enbies get more comments on how they should be androgynous and are conflated with androgyny, whatever the definition is, should use specific pronouns, etc while binary trans people experience the same oppression but in a different way. 

It’s like how Caitlyn Jenner talks about how trans women who don’t pass are giving her a bad name. She’s saying so from a place of privilege.
I really appreciate the advice! I should totally rock classy menswear... especially when it's too extra for the occasion. I think ascots deserve a comeback!! (I'm like...kinda serious??? Lol).

I'm a member of the Long Hair Clan of the Eastern Band of Cherokee, so...cutting my hair would kinda be giving the middle finger to my heritage. At least to me! I know literally one in my tribe or clan cares, but I care ..even though it makes people misgender me :/ damn...epic flowing locks...

"Me: ""I'm very subtle about my sexual orientation and gender identity."" Also me: *pride shoelaces go brr*"		"Omg those are so good & also the exact way Id expose my orientation (also those are my flags too  🤝)
Yoooo, they're so cool!!!! Did you get them from somewhere or make them?!?!?! These are my exact flags too
*waves at you w/ pan / enby solidarity* 
 
:D
 
very pretty!!!
Oh me goooosh, we share the same flags!
I wear a rainbow mask and have two different pronoun pins attached to my jacket lol 

I wanna get even more, like an ace ring and something for me being a lesbian
Hey, I like your shoelaces 👀
Dude, I JUST got both of these!!
Guuuh they're so fucking cute
Omg. I need to get those, i got rainbow laces from wish but they where not the greatest quality.
woah, where did you get these? i want them too
omg where the same
I have converse shoes and I put pride flags on the little bits on the toes. It’s funny I put the same flags on and on the same shoes.
if they had the asexual flag would they be shoe aces?
omg I adore this
clown shoes?
I'm convinced that pride shoelaces are the pinnacle of gender
Is nobody else gonna ask why they look like clown shoes?
Those are class 👊
HA Ha Ha, I can relate as well XD.
those are so cute!
love these!!
These are soooo so pretty!  I’m guessing these are from Etsy or somewhere? They have tons of cute Pride accessories. Admittedly I too try to be super subtle about “pride-signaling” (lol) out of safety, usually just with flags that most people wouldn’t recognize.

For example, I found these cute enamel pins on Etsy that are desserts based off various Pride flags. I bought three that fit my identity/orientation I don’t think any patron who wasn’t also LGBTQ noticed them. https://www.etsy.com/listing/550861186/pastry-pride-enamel-pins-sets-individual?ref=shop_home_active_4
My child will want those shoelaces. I hope there’s a link lol
I need these ! 
Where did you find it ?
Omg I wanna buy the enby ones
Yeaaahhh!!!
Enby pans, untie!

...I mean, UNITE!
OMG YESSS!!!!
Also I need that as well like really bad
You’re just like me
Okay. Those shoes look really comfy. Please tell me what they are. O.O
This literally screams ‘gender is but a social construct’ lol
Those are great!!
I got these flags as keychains on my backpack! Cool to see you!
Oh awesome! I have a bunch of pride items, but I never thought about shoe laces. I'll definitely check out the links you posted in the replies, since I too am enby pan, also vegan (cool shoes BTW.)
We share the same flags
Nothing about these shoes or laces is subtle about your gender or sexual identity.
My 1st thought: clown shoes
I need these
Welcome to the club!   
Nobody in my country probably knows the flags, except the people that have these flags, so not exposed. :D
Mine too!
Same flags tooo 💟
Nonbinary pansexual here too!
They're from etsy. Just search for -whatever lgbtqia+ term- pride shoelaces on there.
*\*Waves back\**

Thank u.
That's cool!
op stole them from the president
Thank u.
I've got them from etsy. :D
Etsy, just search for -lgbtqia+ term you want the flag of- pride shoelaces.
Thank u.
Nope?
Agreeable. -And oversized hoodies.-
Someone already asked. These are barefoot shoes (simulate barefoot walk that is proven to be healthier for feet if you have correct way of walking), so they have more space for toes, otherwise it would defy the purpose.
Yeah, they are from etsy. *I've written that in responses like 20 times already.* :D

I love pins, but I don't have where to put them, so I rather buy clothes nobody's gonna get if I'm not out to them.

There's somewhere link in a comment response, so you can check it out.
I've got them from etsy. Pride shoelaces, if you wanna check.
Does that mean we're sibs now? :D
It's Ahinsa vegan-leather barefoot shoes and the shoelaces are from etsy.
Some kind of barefoot shoe I think - maybe Vivobarefoot - and I want them and the laces, those are my flags too.
Thank u.
Yeah... that's... kinda the point of the joke I made?
They are barefoot shoes. They stimulate barefoot walking without having to make your legs dirty.
Haha, Ive been in the club for the past decade! ✨And yeah I feel ya. Country Im originally from (but not residing in now) is the same. It is in fact dangerous to be recognized as queer over there.
ayy same flags here too
Hooray for nb pans ✨🤝
Which president? :D
Finally the response I'm looking for 👀
Boooooooo
the wide toe made me think of clown shoes
Thanks !
Yeah
Nice! 🤘 The material looks pretty flexible, are they comfy? Hello fellow vegan pan enby! ☺️ Currently rocking vegan barefoot five-toe Vibrams, sooo comfy. ✊
Nice! They all look really great - how to choose?  Hmm...
They're Ahinsa brand and the laces are from etsy.
You're very welcome. 👍
Oh nice
Sounds like my country's eastern neighborhood.
🖖🏽
That makes sense. They're barefoot shoes, so they wouldn't have that effect if they were narrower.
They are the comfiest I've ever had if I don't count actually walking without shoes. :D Glad to find a fellow vegan pan enby here!
ohhhh i’ve never heard of those
Welp, now you have. :D
I’ve been wearing barefoot shoes daily for 2 years now and I absolutely love them! What company are those from?
Ahinsa, they make awesome and very comfortable vegan-leather shoes.

"I'm giving my first national academic presentation tonight since ""coming out"" about both my gender identity and my struggle with my mental health! This is my zoom outfit (the bottom half will obvi be PJs)"		"[deleted]
For all your r/QueerStem nerds hanging around, I'm going to be talking about the molecular mechanism of CBD for mental health disorders. 

I'm going to go over both traditional pharmacology (receptor pharmacodynamics and enzyme inhibition) and a more novel theory that's gaining traction that involves structural modifications of the plasma membrane contributing to receptor pharmacodynamics.

Here's the abstact:

The link between Cannabis sativa and mental health disorders is complicated; both the neurochemical pathology of individual patients and the neuropharmacology of plant extracts are highly variable conditions that are impossible to replicate in the laboratory or across large sample populations in clinical settings. As a result, there is conflicting evidence for Cannabis sativa as both a potential therapeutic and a potential aggravator of mental health disorders including schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, bipolar, and autism spectrum disorder. However, there is theoretical precedence for the efficacy for Cannabis as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and atypical antipsychotic. The proposed molecular mechanisms for these effects have been investigated in animal and human models from the early conception of endocannabinoid system (ECS) research. More recently, the identification of the biosynthetic and metabolic ECS enzymes have added to these findings. Activation of the ECS by direct interaction with receptors or inhibition of metabolic enzymes has been shown to modulate the serotoninergic and dopaminergic systems – the traditional pharmacological targets for mental health disorders. Furthermore the ECS is a critical regulator of social reward and metabolism, both of which can be contributing factors to mental health disorders. Through synergistic interactions with ECS receptors and enzymes, specific formulations of multiple cannabinoids present in modified hemp extracts were capable of aborting/preventing panic attacks, decreasing baseline anxiety, reducing suicidal ideations, reducing hyperesthesia, and reducing auditory hallucinations in a patient formerly diagnosed with co-morbid mental health disorders. Reported is the detailed methodology for titrating the minimum therapeutic dosage and determining a dose-schedule; and the proposed mechanism for chemodiverse cannabinoid formulations that have increased therapeutic efficacy with decreased risk of negative side effects and abuse potential.
Ive never seen a vest worn so well ♡(ӦｖӦ｡)
Enjoy your.... GENDER PRESENTATION
You look amazing!!  🤩
You look very sharp! Best of luck on your presentation, and congrats! ☺👌
classic zoutfit (zoom outfit): classy waist-up, comfy waist-down
🌟
You look so happy!! I'm so glad for you :)
absolutely beaming!! you look amazing!!!
Now this is some incredible gender euphoria!!
Hell yes!! Thank you for the bravery and representation!
thats awesome, congrats!! i hope the presentation goes well, im rooting for ya
I really love the outfit. Very sharp and professional. I would really like to dress like that. Is the vest from a men's shop? I always wondered how it would fit me but I never found one in the ladies section.
That is a stunning look. Jealous 😜
wish i had your hands & arms wow
You look stunning! Go knock them dead with your knowledge and experiances!! 🖤🌈🖤
You look great!! Break a leg!
Slay Your Eminence!
You look sick, love the vibe! Fellow academic NB here :) You're pretty damn aspirational.
Late to the party, I just wanted to say your smile made my day! It really is contagious. You seem to be just so honestly happy, I love it.
You look great and also so darn happy!
Aww yay! I'm not really out at work - not universally at least - so it's great to hear it went well! Hope the talk was a smash hit 😄
You look absolutely stunning. Best of luck for the presentation!
You look both so dope and so happy! :D
You sooo pretty! I wish you the best with your mental health and i hooe that all your future endavours go well!
-im dutch so if i fucked up any spelling/grammar im sorry
Fun fact: you're amazing <3

Good to see fellow NB people in academia!
You're awesome!
You're a badass! Thank you for your amazing work
I'm so glad! When I came out to my business partner it went so well that it actually gave me the confidence to have those conversations with my family and then eventually change my pronouns officially professionally... It's funny how a domino effect can be created!
You are so cool. Thank you for doing this amazing and important research for those of us with mental health disorders who use cannabis, and congratulations on your presentation. Thank you for being your authentic self. ❤️
NEAT!
Thank you! I'm such a fan of the vest look, but haven't had anywhere to wear it. Mostly cause I can get away with not wearing a binder, which unfortunately pops my ribs out of place.
Hahaha! I am going to use this joke I like it
Thank you!!
Thank you! I am way happier dressed this way than in a dress and heels (which was my former conference attire).
Thank you for being part of this awesome community! I lurked on here for a really, really long time before I got the courage to come out. This sub is so awesome.
I am pretty sure it’s from a boys section - I’m pretty short so it was advice from this sub to look in boys!
Hey thanks - it's funny, I have hated my arms/shoulders for my entire life and it turns out that it wasn't really about my body, but about the fact that I was rejecting the non-feminine look of my body.. I'm not sure if I'm explaining it well, but when I figured out I was an enby, all of a sudden a significant amount of my body dysmorphia/dysphoria went away.
Yay for fellow NB pushing boundaries in higher ed! Also thank you, I like to think I am ""aspie""-rational as well :)
Thank you! It's been interesting. I am constantly catching myself misgendering myself because it's so ingrained in me especially in formal professional settings. But every time someone gets it right it really makes my day!
Thanks so much for listening and for feedback!
You are very welcome and thank you for your support! I think it’s an important topic because people who struggle with mental health are more vulnerable to negative side effects from any drug... I know there were times in my life when I wasn’t helping myself but was just seeking escape. Then when I learned in depth about the delicate balance of our brains and our ability to use drugs as tools for improving quality of life, perspective, etc, I knew I wanted to try to impart that knowledge to everyone. Because the reality is that people do find relief, but they could also let it get out of hand or perhaps they could improve quality of life even more from just a bit more knowledge!
Thanks! Feel free to AMA cannabis/endocannabinoid system related!
Ooh that's a very good idea. I think I'll steal it, thanks.
yes! because it’s about reclaiming your gender and feeling comfy and confident in it and in that process, redefining your body and how you express yourself in it!
I would, but I'm too stoned to think of anything"	mm3qhe	NonBinary	2546	1.0	2021-04-07 14:47:22
I made a comic about how my religious upbringing kept me from starting my gender identity discovery (TW religious trauma). Can anyone relate?		"“If you’re really non-binary, why didn’t you start questioning your gender a long time ago?” This is a question that I ask myself a lot... and honestly, I think I was in a place where I just couldn’t. Growing up in the church and a conservative religious school environment most of my life, I was always told who I was and was told not to listen to my own thoughts and feelings about who I am. I look back and see this big part of me peeking through in all sorts of places, but it was never allowed to be free. It wasn’t until I left this environment that I was able to connect to myself and be who I want to be, my authentic self✌️
It does sound kinda like a take on comphet :) 

""Of course I'm straight and cisgender, that's what I'm supposed to be, and being any other way would be wicked, and I'm not wicked, and I don't want to be wicked"", thus one can't begin to question their internal feelings because anything else would be ""wrong"".
I think it's funny that in one's 20s is now considered to be a ""late bloomer"" when it comes to figuring these things out, when, a generation before mine (oldest Millennial), 20s was considered either EARLY or on time.

Many people didn't do it until after marriages and children, after decades had gone past, when they just couldn't lie to themselves anymore. 30s, 40s, 50s. (Heck, my bestie is a genderqueer trans woman (different one from the one I mentioned elsewhere in the thread) and she didn't start transitioning until she was in her 60s and was my housemate.)
I didn't figure it out until I was *forty*. Narcissistic father gaslit me into the same feelings. It took me a long time to break my head out of that, and then everything else started falling into place.
I 100% relate to this. I didn't start questioning my gender until I moved out of my house to go to school. I think my body knew it wouldn't have been safe to be myself while living at home. I grew up in the Christian faith as well and my family is unaccepting of my sexuality/gender identity. I like to think of it as my body protecting me. I'm just glad to finally be able to be me :)
OH YES. I **absolutely** would NOT have realized it if I had remained in my religion. And YES it is 100% gaslighting and **HEAVY** denial. My parents would squelch ANYTHING that even remotely stepped into something resembling a thought that they didn't understand. Had a therapist one time notice 15 year old me struggling with identity and feeling trapped and my parents, to this day, think this was a sign he was trying to groom me...instead of, you know, a sign that their child is hurting and needs help.

I fully left my religion 2 years ago, and until June of this year I've been on heavy overtime at work. THE VERY MONTH I got off overtime and could spend time to just **breath** and *feel myself* I started cracking. I stumbled into a video that explained gender in a way I hadn't ever heard and it sparked my curiosity. It didn't even take a week and I knew I wasn't male. A week later and 29 years of pent up gender dysphoria comes crashing into my face (I've felt dysphoria my whole life, but this is the first time I understood it and didn't simply repress it or bury it under a mountain of religious dogma & bigotry). 

Looking back there are SO MANY SIGNS, but there is so much in my life pushing me away from it: the religion I was raised in and the area being so saturated with that made it nearly impossible to FIND MYSELF. I mean, my old religion **very much** denies the existence of anything not in the binary and strongly CONDEMNS any relationship not strictly cis and hetero. 

So yeah, TLDR, I'm 29 and up until VERY recently religion **heavily** buried me underneath its foot and denied MANY parts of my personality and self from existing: especially my gender. 

(rant over...)
Yes I can relate. I didn't really figure out I wasn't cis until I was 24 because of this, even though all the signs were there.
Relatable! I was 40 when I figured it out because I never let myself look inward for anything but sexual orientation. The religious trauma is real. r/exvangelical
[***cries in realizing at 36 during {whatever the last decade has been}***]
I didn't start questioning my gender until I moved out of my mom's house and in with my partner. Extra points because I ended up moving to a different state at the same time. And that's when I started questioning a lot of things. 

When I was a kid, I started questioning whether I was bi. I told my sister and she flipped. I went so far back in the closet, I convinced myself I was straight for years. After I moved in with my partner, and he gave me a safe space to be myself, I accepted that I'm pan and eventually realized I'm nonbinary in my mid 20s. 

I think, besides possibly not being safe, a lot of nonbianry people in particular don't realize they're nonbinary until they're older because most of us don't have anything to compare our experience of gender against. I knew most of my life that something about me was different,  I just didn't have the language or understanding to figure out what.
Damn, I was raised by atheist liberals and it still took me 30 years to even think about it. 23 doesn't seem remotely ""late"" to me.
I think something has to break your faith that the people around you know what's best for you before you can even consider the possibility that you might be trans. The time before that doesn't really count. The clock measuring how long it takes you to question starts running at the moment you're capable of giving fair consideration to the idea, and not a moment before.
I relate, though not because of religious trauma. I grew up in an abusive home with abusive family, and that meant I could really only be myself to an accepted point, and anything beyond that would be dealt with harshly. This not only affected my gender identity - I was stupid enough to bring it up to my mother (who yes had taught me to tell her everything no matter what) who told me the great thing about being a girl is I could dress like a boy and get away with it so I must just want to dress that way. It didn't mean anything else. It also affected knowing I was autistic. The behaviors were always there, but I masked so hard and was so afraid to show those around family who had rebuked me for it, I didn't get diagnosed until 31 years old. I didn't figure out my gender identity until a year before the autism, either, at 30 - I'd shelved it for years as just being GNC but female. 

With both of these, it would have been dangerous to reveal to my family in various ways. But even so, if I had checked in with myself sooner it would have caused me so many less problems. Knowing at this age means it is harder to get HRT, and get treatment for the autism, as on both fronts treatment works best the earlier you get it. All I can do is do the best I can, now, to make up for lost time.
Wow this is beautiful
Oh yeah, now I think about it, I only really questioned my gender and realized I was trans *after* I became an atheist
Absolutely! I was raised catholic by strict, over-protective parents and a grandmother with outdated attitudes. I tried to fit how they wanted me to be and I did what they wanted me to do in life, but that didn't erase all of the times I cried in the shower because I didn't feel like a real woman or the times I sobbed myself to sleep because my body was wrong. I was 35 when I finally connected that feeling to being non-binary.

I had come to terms with my bisexuality much sooner, like as early as high school, but I didn't have a word for it until my early 20s.
This aspect of religion, heck religion in general is just plain sickening. I'm sorry you've had to deal with that religious propaganda shit.
Yes. I always was against the church and openly speak out about it due to the hypocrisy and how against the LGBTQ/POC community.
Hi, how dare you take a thought directly from my brain and turn it into a relatable comic.
I knew when I was young, but I also squashed it and didn't tell anyone until was over 30. I also took in all the masculinity bs and worked super hard to be as masculine as possible. It wasn't good for me and it wasn't good for those around me.
I can so relate to your story! I think many of us have had these barriers! I am glad you have found your true self :)
This is so real. Thanks for making it
100% same, I still fall into doubting myself around family, it's perfectly normal even if it really sucks
I didn't hatch til 44, and this was a large part of the reason why. Proverbs 3.5-6 was one of ""my"" verses that hung over my head for a long time
Very much so,currently in a religion that made a special sermon that denounced each letter of the LGBTQ+
I can relate. I used to be transphobic because of it, too
I live in a very religious state but I stopped believing in the church I grew up in when I was 12. Throughout my teenage years, I questioned my identity, but I stopped myself because I was afraid of what people would think of me if they found out. It was last year that I realized that I’m genderfluid.
Yes yes and yes!!!!!! My parents were not strictly religious, however I went to a church school OF MY OWN VOLITION (I emphasize that bcuz I don't want ppl to think my parents forced me) and they taught me to be scared of God, as well as lots of homophobic+misogynistic ideals. This made me incredibly fearful of being human. It didn't help that my mom didn't like me trying to be masculine in anyway... I'm proud to say I overcame that. Now as a 21 year old, I can proudly say that I'm nonbinary/xenogender. I can be a boy whenever I want to, and I can be a girl whenever I want to. I can be both, and neither all at once. I can feel connected to space and the stars if I wish. I can do whatever the hell I want because it's MY body. No one has the right to dictate what I do with myself.
This comic really captures growing the specific brand of Christian that doesn't let you question anything (let alone gender) so well.

For me it took a solid two years after moving out of my religious family's home to set off the gender crisis. Knowing you're safe now is powerful stuff.
I’m not religious but this is really cool! I’m still figuring myself out but my parents were transphobic and still don’t understand entirely but they try. I keep this part of me walled off to them because you either are a girl or a boy in their opinion, basically
I questioned about once a year, like clockwork. I still didn't figure it out until a year ago, because my questions weren't taken seriously, I was taught that being trans was a terrible choice ans a sin, and that there were only men and women. All because of Christianity.

I effectively had a broken arm and kept being told bones couldn't break.
I also relate and love your comic. I’m newly out in my late 20s and despite being surrounded by nb and trans folks throughout college, it still took years for me to undo the religious upbringing and mindset that kept me closeted for so long, to even myself. 

Not sure where you sit in terms of religion/faith/spirituality, but your comic shares the same name as a song by Semler and I found her music to be especially therapeutic and relatable.
“maybe you weren’t able to come out earlier because your body knew it wasn’t safe” hit different fuck bro. years of trauma, years of maturing and putting myself back together every time i was broken, years of slowly reaching my conservative family that white cishet christians aren’t the only kind of people who deserve respect and basic human decency…. and finally i was safe enough to look inward and find myself
This is so accurate actually, now that I think about it. I've really only began questioning my gender (and orientation) after I became more distant from the church and more exposed to LGBTQ+ knowledge. At the moment the nonbinary spectrum and the bi/pan/omni spectrum are looking mighty appealing.
Your question made me wonder....

Personally, I always knew I was not a ""typical"" representative of my assigned gender. And I agree that religious upbringing or society forces you to pick a box and stay within it or ""else."" 

However, thinking about this more in my case personally ""sex"" and ""gender"" were basically synonymous, so since biologically I was one, I must have been that...when I learned about those two being disassociated from one another it became clear I identified as non-binary. It just fit and was ""right""

For me it was more there not being another choice, than religion or culture. Although, the religious teaching and notion of moral behaviors definitely increased the internal (and external) conflict during the process.
i definitely feel this
I do.
Damn
I'm shook. 
Thank you.
I relate to this so much.  I was raised in a fundie cult.
This is so relatable
This is amazing. Thank you. 🥺
I can relate to this too. 24 when I finally gave space to everything I’d been thinking and feeling
Sadly relatable :(
This is really profound. Thank you for creating this art and sharing it, because I see myself reflected in your experience. Sending you so much love and I hope you have a safe space and community now ❤️❤️❤️
Woahhhhh........
fuckin SAME lol
My partner and I were literally just talking about this today, plus their autism and severe dissociation from family trauma stuff.
Same for me, except 32, and after my mom died as well because she was strict af and I subconsciously knew she wouldn’t accept me.
My experience is very similar
Same, tbh - JW family.
I was like this till by bestie started pointing out inconsistencies with me. I’m glad I figured out myself really early (I’m 17 now) but now I’m depressed cuz I’m not accepted by family. I wish to change how I look but I can’t do that safely or easily due to the fact I still live with them and I’m not old enough or have enough funds to do so. Each day is a pain, but I’m ever grateful I found myself. I always knew something was wrong deep down, I just didn’t know what.
i feel this so hard

college was the first time i had a chance to really explore who i was outside my family and upbringing—i learned so much and some of it hurts but ultimately i am myself now and that’s so valuable
This hits way too close to home
I was in my 30s when the pieces started falling into place for me but I grew up in a home where I was forced to go to church or face punishment until I was 16. People at school called me queer and gay all the time, guess they knew before I did lmao.
30 here! Idk if I would ever have gotten to this point of self-awareness, if my courageous wife hadn’t come out herself just a few years ago. Apparently it was the shock to my system that I needed. I’m a little sad I couldn’t have started figuring this stuff out earlier, but I am also just really grateful that I ended up in such a safe place that I am figuring it out now.
Yeaaaah....

I knew about nb and the rest but never really understood it or thought much about it. I just... assumed I was female because thats what I was told. And like you, my religious upbringing discouraged thinking about it all.

I got a haircut where my head is shaved except the top floof. I felt euphoria and it was incredible and bizarre all at once. I started reflecting and felt maybe I wasn't female.

For awhile, I leaned to the other extreme of wanting to be a male and very masc presenting. I got a binder and looked at packers and everything. Sometimes I still feel like that but its not as often anymore.

For the most part, I don't feel I have a gender. I just... exist. I don't like being perceived as female. I wish I could be seen as androgynous. I often ""jokingly"" say I identify as an art goblin because I'm always in pj pants and a hoodie and often curled in a ball drawing or writing. In reality, I say it because i don't really know what to call me. My friend suggested agender but i haven't looked more into it yet (yay college homework lol)
I grew up very catholic. By the time I found out that I and people like me existed the religious trauma was so ingrained that I was a dirty sinful abomination. That took a lot of time and work to undo and honestly I still question whether I'm ""really non-binary"" or just confused or going through a phase or trying to be different.

It's constant work. Especially when you are still in daily contact with those people (I love my family, they are mostly rad, it makes it somewhat complicated 🤣) but I'm way less confused living as my badass nb self and a whole lot happier.

Thank you for this! Love the comic
Yup, make that 29 for me.
Omg that is me thankyou for making that comic it's amazing
A lot of my childhood was getting told “you don’t want that, that’s for girls”.

I found out 5 months ago that I was, in fact, supposed to be a girl. Still closeted tho.
Literally same. Which flavor of Christianity did you get brainwashed by?
holy fuck this is too relatable
Wow I love this
This is my story exactly. Grew up in church and went to religious school my whole life. Under the surface I always new something was up, but I never believed myself and kept trying to be a good Christian girl. At age 23 I had finally broken down enough of my religious trauma to begin exploring my gender. Now I’m 25 and living as non-binary. It’s still difficult sometimes, but I feel so much happier now. 🖤🤍💜💛
I went to a single sex school and I think that plus my actual gender identity being closest to agender is why I never really questioned it until recently. With hindsight there were signs, but everyone around me was female so obvs I was too and it never came up in day to day life because there was no-one around really to differentiate myself from. But I knew I didn't fit in, and I knew I was an oddball.
Same, love the cómic.
I didn't have the language to question my gender. I'm 38 and grew up in age where it was illegal for staff to even mention queers in school. I was just a bit of a tomboy. In my twenties, I was desperately performing the cis-het woman for the brownie points. 

I only really _felt_ my gender when I put myself in a deliberately gender ambiguous mode to go on a hitchhiking trip, which seemed safer than going as a woman. And I felt so good out of my feminine clothing, I still remember looking at myself in the mirror, like I'd put down a ten tonne weight. I was 34.

By then I had the language to describe the feeling and things started to fall into place. So relieved I don't have to play that old game anymore.
I didn't know till 28. I had an extremely religious family and soon after graduating high school joined a fraternity in college. I live in Idaho also which didn't help either. It wasn't until I decided to leave my family and friends in Idaho that I even considered what gender I wanted to be. I'm 30 now and transitioning was the best idea I've ever had hands down. Though I lament constantly the time it took me to realize I know that for the great majority of my life I never even knew Non-bianary was an option and once I knew I had only fear towards the realization I might be trans. Be kind to your past selves. It's a pretty extreme journey at any age, under any circumstances but your gut will tell you when it's time.
this makes a lot of sense. im trans and also grew up in a religious home, i didnt even think or worry about gender until senior year of high school. i feel robbed of my childhood and what could have been if i couldve just lived the life i wanted and be who i am. your art is beautiful i love it! thank you for this :) <33
I was 34!
Yup, DEFINITELY can relate. I'm 28 and realized 2 years ago, and it's only because the church I'd been a part of had imploded from scandals and the remainder was online only for the pandemic. Because I wasn't constantly stuck with a friendgroup of toxic, bullying men who were 4-10 years older than me, I was finally able to start being myself. It's ironic, though
Yeah I dissociated hard from religion because the people around me didn’t want what was best for the world, only themselves
growing up in a fundamentalist muslim family did that to me. growing up being told i need to be hyper feminine but also being punished for it made for a really good combo. being “highly encouraged” to wear a hijab, and to “embrace modesty” which really means make yourself as small and invisible as possible. that stuff sucks to unlearn
I was about 35-36…
Thank you so much for making this. I’ve never been able to put it into words ♡
Thanks for making this, it really captures my own story/feelings on my own coming out.
I actually needed to read this one today haha. I'm in a similar predicament only truly questioning my gender at 22 and finding out who I want to be. Grew up in a pretty toxic environment caused by both religion and just bad parenting. Gender dysphoria or even just trying to figure out how I wanted to identify were the least of my problems. It's only once I gained independence that I started to realise what those feelings actually meant. The fact that it took so long to realise that I am trans/non-binary always makes me doubt that I am despite all the evidence to the contrary but reading this makes me feel a little more assured in myself. 

Thanks for sharing your experience.
My cousin made a comic similar! I’m proud of them for finding themselves despite their religious upbringing, and I’m proud of you too :)
That sucks. That… oof. Those verses are meant to be seen as “humans can’t know everything, can we?” but so many people turn it into “don’t trust any of your feelings and listen to what *I* have to say because *I* definitely am not falling prey to those exact same vices”
Jesus is the way. You've been deceived
I'm 32 and figured out last year that I'm not cis. I figured out this past Wednesday (it's Friday now) that I'm a trans nonbinary man. I know someone who is 70 and who came out in her 50s. *It's never ""too late"" to figure this stuff out/come out.*

When I was a kid I corrected people who mistook me for a boy. I played with My Little Pony toys and wanted fancy Barbies just like my older sister had. In highschool I really enjoyed full circle skirts (twirling for the win!) and wanted to have corsets. I enjoyed wearing feminine clothes that I looked good in. *How you acted as a kid doesn't always indicate your actual gender.*

In my 20s I had a skirt with more inserts so it was actually beyond ""full circle"" (all the twirls!) and had one corset and one corset dress. Being able to buy my own clothes meant even more clothes that actually looked really good on me, being able to better accentuate my body shape, and being able to move towards being the gothic queen I wanted to be. My goal was to be ""the Lady of the house"" and things that didn't fit just served as proof of where I grew up (like being able to change a tire and not worrying about getting dirty). *Your gender doesn't have to be static, it's ok for it to change.*

Funny aside: but no, I totally can't relate to this /s Seriously tho, it took a long time for me to feel safe enough to accept that I'm not a cis woman, and it took being around people who weren't cis for me to even start questioning things
I have felt from experience that the heart is truly deceitful and wicked... That said, I don't believe my gender identity comes from the heart. I don't know how to explain but... I just am. And I know, personally, that God understands.
I can't relate, I'm actually still Christian, but I am glad you were able to get through it and in touch with yourself. I was a late bloomer because I never met or even knew about trans people until I was in Grad school. At that point I started considering it.
""was already 23""
I wish I was 23, lol
Don't even have to grow up in a religious family to be affected by it. I can't fully relate to being stuck in a religious house, my parents dropped religion when we were small kids and that's a whole different thing. But you could never just be friends with anyone. Then you think you might have a friend only for their parent to tell you, you can't come over anymore because you don't ""act right"" or they only allow their kid to play with kids from their church. I was accused of being gay a lot as kid because I didn't act like my assigned gender. I just wanted to be myself and refused to fake it. It was very lonely for a long time. Didn't have the word for enby until more recently, and no one talks about that to kids growing up so you miss any chance to get to be yourself earlier on
""told who I was...was told not to listen to my own thoughts and feelings about who I am."" I relate to this SO much. Also ""never allowed to be free"" looking back on how restrictive my upbringing was is baffling. 

lol, my brother teases me for being on reddit, but I love hearing stories of others finding themselves. I'm thick in the middle of finding myself too, but it makes me so happy to hear others getting through it.
we have similar stories. I was 27 when I came out. Reflecting back there were signs, but I didn't have the categories or language until I had first moved out of the religious community I grew up in, and as you said, was finally safe and secure enough.
Forgive me if this isn’t exactly the same. But, at the age of 51 I have finally come out to my councilor that I am Bisexual. Throughout my life I hated myself. I hid my feelings. And your illustrations basically answered to me again why I hid my true feelings. I want to thank you for creating this. This may help me when I try to explain to my friends why I have decided to come out now.
As someone who was sent to a Calvinist school from primary school to high school diploma, I know how this feels. I also had the feeling that something ""isn't right"", that I wasn't ""supposed to"" feel this way. And now that I've been outta there for 3 years, almost 4, I could finally start asking questions to myself and think about what I really feel, like ""Why do I not feel like the gender I was assigned at birth?"" ""Why do I have butterflies in my stomach when a classmate is nice to me, regardless of gender?"" And what these answers showed me other than why I feel this way is that I am actually not alone. And now that I think back to everything I did and was told as a  childhood story, it all clicked. It all checked out. The signs were there this whole time and everyone played it off as child being adventurous or kids will be kids.
I had a similar situation, but less tied to religion. When I was much younger, I used to stim a lot, and hyperfixate/obsess over things I found interesting. Over time I’ve inadvertently masked it so much, that I can barely connect with that part of myself anymore. I want it to be free, but rather than society or religion being the culprit, it’s me keeping it bound. Sure, it was society who influenced it (the dirty looks when I stimmed, the hateful comments when I acted “weird”) but now that I’m an adult I shouldn’t have that pressure. It’s hard to let yourself be free after so long of being tied up.
I relate to this so much! Thanks for sharing.
I came out in my 30s. Because I was independent, and in the safety of that independence, I felt safe finding myself.
Absolutely. Comphet doesn't only come in that religious flavor of ""you're going to hell, if ..."", but also in a vague, general way of society showing you every day that there's cis-het-allo and nothing else. My parents are pretty accepting, but that constant low level societal background noise of ""you're a boy, boys grow into men, men marry women"" is enough to block out questions. At least I think that's the main reason why I only started actively thinking about my sexuality in my 20s and about gender in my 30s.
This exactly.

In my personal experience, this also tied together with repressed sexuality which overcompensated into hypersexuality. While I've moved past that stage, I still feel uncomfortable coming out, especially to my parents.
Thanks for sharing that! That’s good to know. For me that’s how it felt, but I know that’s not the case. I know there’s no real timeline to how this stuff happens, everyone finds out in their own time!
I feel that too (youngest millennial crowd). It was not at all the norm for kids or teens to be out when I was growing up. I usually just hear cis folks say that they expect you to have ""signs"" from your childhood, not necessarily that you should have been out.
Yea in the UK we had section 28, which meant we couldn't learn about all the variations of Queer as it was banned in school, because of that underrepresented in media. So there's people in their late 20s-30s upwards who just didn't know certain labels existed / were possible.

But woop for working it out against the odds 💜
As a younger millennial, same. All the signs were absolutely there for me from a young age, but I didn't start figuring it out until my late 20s, simply because I had no idea anything beyond the binary existed. And my parents are atheist and pretty accepting. No age is too late to start questioning and exploring your gender, but I'm really glad that so many more young people are getting access to the words they need to describe themselves.

When I started to question, I had a lot of doubts that I was a ""real"" NB person, so I'll tell you what my older genderqueer friend told me at the time: if you feel that way, and you want to call yourself that, you are. Your opinion on that is the only one that matters.
Yes, I was going to say, I had the same problem but because of familial gaslighting (with a touch of church) because I'm disabled & have psychiatric challenges, and they basically taught me I couldn't trust myself, I had to just believe them (or anyone else who wasn't me) on everything because I was """"""crazy"""""" and """"""wasn't thinking straight"""""".
Yeah I figured it out at 38. 

Really bad religious trauma from growing up super conservative town and family. Wasn’t safe. 

The mind is funny, when it’s trying to protect you like this. I was literally driving across town every morning to go to this one Starbucks that had this like 30 year old punk emo guy. He was super pretty, wore eye shadow and girl jeans. He was gorgeous. I wanted to both be him and be with him. Then I’d drive off and it was like snow on warm pavement. Poof! Totally straight. 

Until I bolted upright at two am when I finally got therapy for the abuse and was like ‘holy fuck I repressed all this!’
Yeah, I’m 36 and just recently came out. I’ve been questioning for about a year, but looking back, I realize I’ve thought about it since I was a kid, but I didn’t have the terminology back then.
[deleted]
30 here! Turns out it’s still worth it.
Thank you so much for sharing! I def think we had some similar experiences ❤️ glad you’re in a better place now
^(Disclaimer: I'm speaking only of my personal experience and not condemning religion as a whole...ok, disclaimer over.)
Yeah I think I had this idea that you’re just supposed to know since adolescence, but I know that’s just untrue in many cases
Yes. This all the way. Without an external trigger I would have gone my whole life assuming I was cis. It took me just over three years from that moment of “awakening” to start questioning. It’s hard for me to even count the “before” time until that point.
Thank you!
Christianity is not a monolith and there's absolutely denominations (or groups within a denomination) that hardcore SUPPORT the LGBTQ/POC communities and are working hard for justice. (Example: I have a friend who's a genderqueer trans woman. She's a minister in the United Church of Christ. Absolutely out and proud at work (a chaplain to a troubled youth home as well as leads a congregation) and to the denomination, and they support her. She doesn't pass (doesn't necessarily want to) and she wears dresses to work and the whole nine yards.)

Not saying your pain is invalid at all (I've got my pain from it, but mine's more about the ableism I experienced), or you shouldn't call out bullshit where there's bullshit (because there's definitely a lot, and it absolutely should be called out), but a lot of people see one part of Christianity (esp. Evangelical Christianity) (whether from the outside or from their own experiences) and extrapolate/act like it's all like that, when it absolutely covers a vast, VAST range of beliefs and actions. (For example, compare Evangelical Protestantism with Roman Catholicism with the Religious Society of Friends/Quakers. Not that RC is spotless by any means, but it's very different from Evangelical Protestantism.)

And there's a lot of people who really hurt because they think they have to choose between their faith and their gender/orientation, and it harms them when we act like they're all the same and they're not exposed to the fact that they don't have to choose, that it's not ALL like that, that there's options. That they can be whatever faith they are AND LGBTQIA+. I'm glad that's an option.

FWIW, I'm not even a Christian (anymore), or from one of the ones who's really good about LGBTQ. I just think it's important to be fair about these things, ESPECIALLY if they haven't been fair to/about us.
;)
It really sucks when people don't know the true meaning of ""fear God"" and use it to scare people ☹️
Thank you for sharing ❤️ sounds like you had a very similar experience! And I’ll have to check that artist out!!
Thank you so much! I appreciate that a lot. Glad you were able to connect with this!
Autistim, queerness, and religious trauma is a rough combo, I know 😅
I’m sorry they went through that.
Sending hugs ❤️❤️❤️ there’s really no easy time to come out... I hope you can find support in others and confidence in your own identity!
Thank you for sharing that ❤️❤️ I totally get where you’re coming from. Ugh, it’s so much stuff to work through. (I’m really glad I’m seeing a therapist about it all) I’m glad you have some more clarity and happiness about your gender now!!
13 years of a very evangelical non-denominational Protestant school (K-12), 8 years of Presbyterian church followed by 10 years of free Methodist church, and 4 years of Nazarene university. So, quite a cocktail 😅 hbu?
Awesome!! 💙
Thank you for sharing. I actually have been thinking about making a comic about just that—being kind to your past selves. It can be really hard sometimes! Def something I’ve been talking with my therapist about.
Isn’t it strange how common scandals are? I’ve seen 4 pastors in my lifetime leave church and/or school because of abuse of power (3 of which were sexual) and that’s just my own church experience! Why is this so normal? 
Glad you got out too:
That sounds really hard ❤️ I hope you’ve found freedom in where you are now!
I’d love to see it! Please dm me the details of their art :)
Yes, I would agree. Sadly, so many teachers, pastors, and other people of influence in my life growing up twisted and manipulated verses of the Bible out of context to say whatever they wanted it to say. Most of what I grew up hearing I don’t actually believe is consistent with the Bible’s teachings. However, I am no longer a Christian so I leave those arguments for other people to make.
That’s awesome! Glad you’ve been on that journey of self discovery
That’s amazing!! I’m also bisexual, and it wasn’t an easy revelation by any means. I’m so glad my art resonated with you in such a big way ❤️❤️❤️
Yeah, I'm 40 years old in the USA (grew up in rural Pennsylvania) and we definitely didn't learn ANYTHING about LGBTQ+ stuff in school, either public or parochial/Catholic.
Yeah, part of my problem has always been the right words (or words closer to right) weren't in high usage yet so I didn't know about them. This is why I personally identified as bigender, and then genderfluid, and then eventually nonbinary. Because nonbinary didn't ""exist"" when I started questioning. It wouldn't really exist for another decade. (I have an enby friend who's literally my age who had the same experience... identified as butch for a long time (like over a decade) but it wasn't quite right for them. The discovery & availability of the word ""nonbinary"" changed their life.)

(And, I don't remember if anyone remembers this or not, but back in the day (mid-2000s), at least where I was, genderqueer (which did exist) had such a specific look and overall vibe with it that it kept some people from using it. I always said when I tried to dress genderqueer that I just looked mismatched and wasn't able to pull it off.)

I remember the day I found genderfluid in a book at my work (I worked at an LGBT bookstore at the time) and I remember saying to my coworkers ""I just found the word for my gender"".

But, yeah, I don't think enough people talk about what it's like when the word for your gender doesn't even EXIST yet. It's SO much better now with all of these new labels.
Sorry, didn’t mean to make you feel behind or excluded! Just an expression of how I’ve been feeling
Lol, it took me until 18 just to come to terms with the fact that I liked guys. My brain is a labyrinth of contradictions and denial.
Oh I know. But I’ve been abused so much by my parents beliefs that it’s to the point where I dislike most denominations.
I’m aware, and I have several friends who are queer affirming Christians. I struggled for a while trying to hold onto my faith, but was unable to. I’ve just been hurt and controlled too much by the church to go back, even to an affirming place. And I’ve been so hardwired to be anti-lgbt by my religious upbringing that being religious AND queer just felt wrong, like trying to push two same-side magnets together. I envy those who are able to hold onto both when I couldn’t!
It's seriously such an intense combo. But im so thankful they have access to therapy now, and a validating therapist they trust. I had no idea what all went into it until we talked about it today. I can never relate bc even tho I grew up in a church, I was not indoctrinated as deeply as they were. And the way they used religion to mask their autism for so long, it's just fucking insane. I feel like we need one of those giant conspiracy boards with the red lines going everywhere.
Ohhh a specificly strict evangelical style split from old Mormonism before Mr Smith started marrying minors called the church of christ
...How in-depth of a response do you want to that? Cause I'm prepped and ready with my personal take, but I also understand if that was meant to be a rhetorical question
Were it not for having that friend I mentioned before, I would probably be in the same camp as you, in the sense of believing that the Bible is being misinterpreted but not wanting to be in the discussion anymore. It’s only cuz of her that I still feel like I have some “chips in play” with the idea of Christianity despite growing apart from my own family and upbringing (which thankfully was a lot more… tame than this)
Catholic school since 5yo so yea the odds were against us (I'm 37 now).
One thing's for sure, the world sure has changed since I was in *my* twenties.
Mood
even denominations aren’t monolithic! american christianity can be a hell of a drug for some people who care more about rugged individualism than community, but there are people in every domination that are more like you than different. i’m a nonbinary lesbian *and* a catholic. i understand the harm the institutional church has done/continues to do in ways and there’s no denying many catholics still hold problematic views on gender, abortion, etc that should be called out and challenged. but i hope people who do feel connection to religion or spiritual expression know that there *is* room for you in the traditions that speak to you and there are people like me who want to help make that room. 

i’m deeply sorry to you and everyone else in this thread who were hurt and made to feel lesser because of religion, but i promise that each and every one of you is *divine* no matter what hateful bigots say.
Oh, I wasn't replying to you, I was replying to Loki'sStray. I don't want you to think you have to justify yourself at all, OP. (I really love your comic, btw.)

But yeah, that happens to a lot of folks. The pain is HELLA real. Some folks eventually make (some) peace with it and decide they want to find their way back in some capacity, either fully, or just for parts they miss. Other folks, that's not the case & have no desire to. Both are a-ok. 👍

I thought I was in /r/exvangelical , and nothing about this comment made sense until I realized my error.
I think there are several coinciding factors that make pastors more likely to commit abuse.

The first has to do with church attendees and evangelism. Contemporary evangelism is often directed towards people in vulnerable emotional situations as a way for them to gain relief from their pain or circumstances. This biases congregations towards those already in or escaping from abusive relationships.

The second has to do with the culture of contemporary churches. A majority of churches in the US have been slowly leaning towards fundamentalist teachings. This drift seems to stem from a few places (especially right-wing politics), but it consistently reinforces patriarchal and authoritarian hierarchies under the guise of traditional, righteous dogma. I doubt I need to explain why that kind of hierarchy makes abuse and coverups easier, but let me know.

The third has to do with the requirements for being a pastor. Generally speaking, they need to be charismatic, approachable, and invested in maintaining the traditions and culture of a church. That combination makes for pastors who are likely to continue and reinforce abusive cultural practices from the previous pastor, even if unintentionally. With that said, I think many who seek that kind of authoritarian power over a congregation are already abusers or are easily swayed into abusive acts.

Considering all these factors, it's a wonder that so few church scandals have even come to light, in my opinion. Traditional American Evangelicalism is ripe with the intersectionality required foe abuse.
Incredibly insightful. Thanks for sharing this. You’re so so right."	xmad4k	NonBinary	2497	1.0	2022-09-23 21:50:49
💅		"yeah fuck where did it go
I may have lost my gender identity in late middle age, but I'm finding a new one.
I love how virginity is rainbow and subtly implies it could've been an extremely gay experience 😭
Sorry to be that guy but 'virginty' got me
Lol, imagine having a gender! 💛🤍💜🖤
My dog ate it along with my homework.
ha ha nice!
This meme is amazing! 🌠👏

It's hilarious and on point.

Cause, that's more or less how it went.

Thank you OP 💚
Imagine having one gender *laughs in demigirl*
True!
I've never lost my virginity, as for gender identity, well I can't really lose what I never had can I?
I lost mine but I haven't made i to high-school yet lol
Hmmm have you looked in the washing machine? Mine always gets stuck inside the sealing if I forget to take it out of my pockets before washing.
I sold mine on eBay for 5 bucks, got some nice sour cream and onion lays chips afterwards.
yikes
Yeah, I have literally the same
It woulda been nice if mine left so early, was a couple years late on that one
Not to brag. But I lost both and my mind.
Bro I lost it in middle school
i ate it sorry i was just so hungry
facts
(me too but don't tell)🤫😂
Same here ♠️💜💚🤍
Absolutely, gender is extremely overrated. 🖤🤍💚🤍🖤
Couldn't be me
imagine knowing how many genders you are *laughs in unlabeled genderqueer*
good point
What the heck give it back
muahahahahahahaha
They already ate it, sorry
But mom said I could eat the last gender

Coming to terms with my own gender identity and trying to be more comfortable with my appearance. First crop top high wasted jeans. How am I doing?		"Maybe I'm dumb but I thought this was harry styles at first. You look great
you look amazing

Awesome! That's a great look with some retro vibes
You're stunning!

U cute as hell! Love the crop top
Looking great!!

Suits you very well, you look great 💕
You're telling me this isn't Harry Styles?
SeeYouSpaceCowboy... is one of my favorite bands
No offense in any way possible but you kinda look like Harry styles also you look awesome!!!
harry styles? i-
Wow!   I have to say it's a pretty snazzy look.   Reminds me of a cross between 50's ""greasemonkey"" and 80's grunge!  I think it suits you...  neatly done, and dynamite!
Looking good but please don't feel pressured to use gender expression to validate your gender identity.
You are NB and you we valid, no matter what you wear 😁
You are a beautiful human
Omg you’re HOT
Youre doing AMAZING ! That outfit looks absolutely stunning on you! Keep rockin it mate
Cutie
That's a great look for you. I adore Harry Styles, but I think you're actually cuter than he is. Thanks for the inspiration to all us aspiring enbies out here. BTW, you might also like this sub:  r/femboytransition

You are sooooo cute! High waisted jeans and crop tops give me so much euphoria as an amab enby
I can't express how much I love your look! 

I can never find a good pair of high waisted jeans that'll fit me 😭 So jealous!
OH my god you are gorgeous. How are you doing? You're KILLING IT is how you're doing!!! Keep it up never stop

Absolutely Fabulous!

You're doing great, honey. <3
SUPER cute!
I love that look!!! I really like high top skinny jeans, but I struggle to find ones that fit me well. Not having hips, women's jeans are loose on me at the waist. Mens skinny jeans fit me better but are never high top. The struggle is real 😑
Your doing Great!
I've been trying to work up the confidence for crop tops lately. You look great!
You look adorable. My aesthetic exactly.
i think it looks great, probably feels great to be living your authentic self
Way to use that long torso! The crop top looks great!
You are doing bloody awesome!
You're a ⭐ STAR⭐ keep shining
Babe you look incredible!!! 💙
YOU ARE DOING GREAT
Dang you got a nice tummy. But seriously, you look good.
I thought the same thing
Dam they do look kinda like Harry Styles
They look way hotter than harry
Thanks! They're from Topshop, they're the Considered Bleach straight jeans.
Same, looking forward to hearing some new stuff in a few months!
This 100%. I was AMAB & I've barely made any changes to my appearance since I came out as non binary and I feel completely confident in who I am as agender. However, if they want to express their gender identity through exploration outside of what society considers to be normal for us, then that's absolutely cool, too. Either way, we're here to support you, enby fam. 👍❤️
Thanks so much!
Unnessecary and rude.
Those jeans are fucking boss, you could probably rock those in any outfit!
Definitely!  As long as there’s sass and breakdowns :)

Hey all, it's been a while hasn't it? During that time I had been questioning my gender identity....again, and I've figured out that I'm actually a trans girl! So I guess I'll be moving over to r/trans. But I will be sticking around here because I love seeing all of y'all being happy!		"Yaaaaay! So happy for you! Stop by again any old time!
I guess I won’t be moving to r/trans alone ☺️
Congrats!! Wish you all the best :)
Congratulations!
Congrats on finding yourself! I’m glad this community has helped you and I hope it continues to.
Hey, I'm a trans guy who thought he was an enby initially and is still on this sub because the people are great :) congrats on figuring out your gender!
congrats! so happy for you !!

So happy for you!
So happy for you! Best of luck on your journey! ❤️
Congrats on figuring that out! I’m proud of you and happy for you!! Have an incredible day!!! :)
Well done! Don't forget that you can question and change your gender to whatever, whenever you like- Enjoy being female!
I hope this doesn't come across as wrong but since you look young, please for the love of all that is holy, enjoy your gorgeous body to the full! 

Once upon a time, I had a lovely young body but stupid me did not enjoy it & now I look at old photos & think WTF WAS WRONG WITH ME?!? I still look good & try to enjoy my body more now, but I wish someone had said to me, ""You look damn fine! Enjoy your sexy youth in whatever way makes *you* happy!"" So now I'm saying it to you. Sexy older adult is real too but I don't want anyone to have the regrets I do.

You look beautiful!
That's so great! 💖 Also you look magnificent in that and I'm jelly 😚
So happy you found yourself! Congrats!
holy moly you’re gorgeous!
Congrats. Nice outfit:)

I have yet to see many folks of color in this community post selfies so since I am brand new to understanding this identity for myself, I'd like to say: Hey! I'm Gabe! 25, black, bisexual, and feeling good about this $3 thrifted outfit I wore today 😊		"Holy hell yes that outfit! Clearly the thrift gods smile on you :) Great selfie, Gabe. I hope to see more.
!!! finally another poc on this subreddit. how you doing? :D (im black too and half puerto rican)

and you look amazing. i always feel like thrifting really works out of us enby peeps, idk why. i bought flannel and pants from the mens section and when i wore them holy heck do i pass. what do i pass as? who knows! that’s the best part.
Hi Gabe! It’s so uplifting to see other enbies of color in here! You look amazing and keep it up!! 💙💙
Ah another black bisexual of culture. Nice find
Awesome! Always great to see more NB POC representation here and you look super cute.
That smile is infectious! Keep it up ☺️
Gabe, I know you already know this, but $3 for that outfit is a damn steal, and you are rocking it
Hey Gabe! 

You look absolutely stunning and it's amazing to see more black enbies posting on here!! I'm in awe of your smile and stunning thrifted outfit! <3
BIPOC NBs 🤗
Oof that outfit🔥

I'm enby & black too but I never posted selfies of me 'cause I'm just too bad at taking them lol (maybe will do when I get my dream outfit) 
I'm AJ btw.
That outfit is everything
Hi Gabe! You look amazing! <3
Looking good Gabe!! Thrift store finds are the best 😊
You are beautiful
always a love a thrifted fit! you look fantastic and sustainable thanks for posting!!
You are doing awesome! You look good and hopefully you feel as good as you look in this community!
Woah, you look *great*
Hey, Gabe! How goes?
That's a dope outfit Gabe! Welcome ^.^ hopefully representation like this will make more POC feel comfortable posting here
I dig your style! You're really attractive, my friend
Oh damn!  Always promote reusing products versus buying new, solidarity comrade!
Oh my god you look amazing!! Thrift shopping is such a good way to find clothes, and you're absolutely rocking that style!
cuuute!
That jacket was $3?!
Welcome to the community fam✊🏽
Heya Gabe! Thank you for sharing your wonderful face and fashion sense! Thrift stores are the best!
$3??? For that entire outfit??
yess, go on with your bad self! 🤟🏿💯
I'm a poc but I kind of hate writing that because I'm white passing so people usually don't believe me :/
Damn, did you tailor that jacket? It fits you so nicely!
Lookin fresh as fuck!
I’m a transmasc enby of color ☺️i love thrifting! I got lots of nice sweaters from my local thrift store. Very warm and very comfty!
Just a question. Do you think of bisexual as liking two gender, or specifically girls and boys? Would you call it bisexuality if you like girls and enbies?
Heck yes! 👏👏👏
On point!
Love it! You and that outfit are both gorgeous. Love the green!
chungus
Okay but like smile goals, you’re frickin gorgeous what the heck!!! Welcome to the community!! 💛💛
White people think they invented gender 🙄
NO WAY, 3 BUCKS??!!A oh and hi!
Thank you! Yes, I plan to post selfies on occasion going forward so I'm sure you'll see more of me soon!
as a fellow poc enby: TEACH ME YOUR WAYS
I was thinking there have GOT to be other folks of color out here so maybe show my face and others will appear....and voila! Haha, I'm glad to hear you are a successful thrifter too! Passing as a question mark is my favorite thing now. Gotta keep em guessin' and keep impressin' with how we're dressin' 😉
Thank you, fellow kindred soul. I hope to see future updates from you as well in this community!
So nice to find people like yourself isn't it. Representation matters and when it's lacking where we want it most, sometimes we just have to represent ourselves....and thanks! I love thrift shopping!
Agreed! Aww and thank you, I really appreciate the compliment!
*smiling intensifies* 😁😁😁
Thanks! I live in Las Vegas and there's a killer thrift store out here that has a  99 cent sale every Monday. I got the sweater, pants, and blazer each for a buck! I am super happy with the look 😊
Aww shucks, thank you for your kind words! It means a lot to me since I often struggle with anxiety/depression and you guys are the only ones who know my new name and enby identity. So the support and compliments are everything <3
*sending happy virtual hugs right back at ya*
Hey AJ! It is nice to meet you! Selfies are pretty scary but I think the confidence came from how safe and welcoming this community feels. None of my friends/family are here on Reddit and since this aspect of my identity is still new to me I felt more comfortable posting here than anywhere else ...if you ever decide to post a selfie I'll be here to gas you up and cheer you on!! Good luck on your dream outfit. It is out there waiting for you, no doubt.
Isn't it?? Haha, thank youuuuu
I feel amazing! Thank you for your kind words :-) <3
Yessss, poppin' tags foreverrrrr
Thank youuuuu!!
Thank you! I feel pretty splendid on the inside now too 😊 Who knew dressing to match your authentic self could be so liberating?
Overall, pretty well! Currently on the job hunt again but feeling good about my sense of identity. It's already helping me to feel more confident about myself and my goals for the near future....so I cant complain...I hope life is treating you well, too
That was precisely my intention!! That's actually all I want in life, to see more marginalized and underrepresented folks in as many spaces as possible. Hopefully I can help inspire others to feel more represented :-)
Oh jeez, that's too sweet of you! Thank you fellow internet friend!
Thank you! I prefer thrifting over going to a mall any day. So much more fun!!
Oh no, the entire outfit was $3!! I live in Vegas and there's a sick thrift store out here that has 99 cent sales every Monday. I got the sweater, pants, and jacket for 99 cents EACH!! Twas a killer shopping day, indeed.
Thank you, it feels good to be here!
Yes!! There's a thrift store here in Vegas called ""Opportunity Village"" which is like Goodwill on crack because every Monday they have 99 cent sales. Certain color tags a selected and, store wide, that color becomes 99 cents. The color this Monday was blue so I got the sweater, the jacket, and the pants for 99 cents a pop!
Do people always believe people when they come out as LGBTQIA? People will forever believe what they wanna believe....all that matters is what is true for YOU. If being POC is your truth then that is a beautiful thing. Own that and know that you have people like me in your corner proud to see you embracing it!
Nope I bought it off the rack exactly like that! It's from the brand Jones New York which I think isn't quite designer but slightly nicer then most everyday brands so it is already tailored well. And thank you!! I love it 😊
Hello there! I love hearing that you found some gems that suit you well! That is such a delightful joy
That is a very interesting question and I honestly think I am technically pansexual considering your point and the fact that I identify as enby. I have heard of other folks that are attracted to every gender (trans and those that are genderqueer) admit to that ""pansexual"" is more accurate but ""bisexual"" can also include everyone....hmmm....I'm sticking with bi for now but that may change down the line. Excellent point! Thank you for bringing it up.
What is a chungus?
Oh stopppp, haha. Thank you!! I'm smiling even bigger now 😁
Do they? Idk...but whoever ""invented"" it can keep it lol. Life is more fun when you get to toss them aside, embrace them all, mix them up, and do whatever the heck you want with them in my opinion. Just do you!
Yepper doodles! The local thrift store here in Vegas had the sweater, jacket, and pants each for 99 cents!! Yeehaw! 🤠
💕💕💕
I'm so sorry to hear you're going through so much pain mentally, you are most definitely in my thoughts ♥️ and you are still thriving! I'm so glad you feel accepted here and seen. Sending love and peace !

listen kid, you're clearly not a reddit connoisseur like myself, i have over 10,000 karma points and hours in this site, and i know every single meme on the planet, let me just explain what a chungus is to your knaive simple mind: chungus is a fat fucking rabbit which i myself find quite erotic, as a hecking chonker myself, i can relate to big chungus on a personal level. now that you know what a funny chungus is, you might want to rephrase your speech or else there'll be consequences from john wick (keanu reeve wholesome 100) sayonara, busta grimes

yeah i getcha. looks really nice ❤️"	ydklzc	NonBinary	1316	0.99	2022-10-26 00:48:51
I'm sick of people narrowing down non-binary people to their agab	"Something I often see on different LGBT subreddits is people continuously separating non-binary people into 2 categories: amab and afab.

I'm sick of it, [here's an example of it happening](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/122benp/am_i_still_considered_a_lesbian_if_im_attracted/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), the whole point of being non-binary is to go outside of the binary, no?

I just don't see why agab should be relevant much, by mentioning it, it feels like erasing the non-binary gender identity and turning it into: male lite and female lite.

I'm transfem so I don't understand the entire issue completely but I wanna hear your thoughts on this, I apologize if this has been posted here multiple times in the past."	"Agreed. That's why I rarely mention my agab, it's absolutely invalidating when people make a big show of ""thats my nonbinary friend they're amab ^_^"" and it's like no pls stop, and it doesn't matter in 99% of conversations on here and irl.
I use my AGAB when I'm referring to experiences, usually social or medical, that were influenced by it.
I'm not huge on using afab/amab to describe myself and only will if I absolutely have to. I feel what I was assigned at birth is absolutely nobody's business because it tells you nothing about my gender, how you should refer to me/treat me today, etc. 

People use it all the time incorrectly as well. People all the time will ask questions ""for afab people"" about things like periods, when in reality that is not something that all afab people experience for so many reasons and many people on estrogen experience period-like symptoms as well.  

I'm all for not giving people information on what you were assigned at birth unless you absolutely have to. It's not something that genuinely adds to a post most times imo.
What really bugs me about how some even well meaning allies use AGAB acronyms is the fact that the whole point of AGAB acronyms is to show the concept that one's sex assigned at birth is not something that one inherently ""is"", but rather something that, in the case of intersex people, the community where these acronyms were first coined, the AGAB is something that is **done** to them non consensually by a doctor, not something they inherently **are** biologically. Using these acronyms in the way a lot of people do now, as a biologically essentialist thing, compltely erases the orginial purpose they had in the intersex community.

It's ridiculous how even well meaning allies might say stuff like ""AMAB genitals"" when referring to penises. It's like the fact that SRS exists just completely slips from their mind. Another example is something like when people think they are being all ""biologically scientific"" when they say stuff like ""People with AMAB bodies have a higher tolerance to alcohol than people with AFAB bodies,"" forgetting that sexually dimporphic response to alcohol is entirely due to sex hormone differences that can be changed with HRT causing different levels of alcohol dehydrogenase in the stomach, and not due to one's AGAB.

In the context of the link you provided, it's likely that the person who said that has this mental image of an ""AFAB non binary person"" as being someone who presents androgynously but ""looks more like a woman"" in their eyes due to having estrogen induced secondary sex characteristics.

They don't realize that an AFAB nb person can also be someone who is masc presenting and on T, and may be read as a cis man by this person, obvivious that this is an afab nb person. Conversely, an AMAB nb person who presents androgynous and has estrogen induced secondary sex characteristics from being on E may be read as an ""AFAB non binary person"" by this person because they fit that mental image that person has of what they find attractive in ""AFAB nb people"", not realizing that this person is actually an AMAB nb person.

Cis people are taught by society that biological sex is a boundary that cannot be crossed, and sometimes cannot process the fact that many aspects of biological sex can be changed with medical technology, and that AGAB is not this unbreakable biological boundary like it's made out to be.

Even without medical transition, people don't realize how much gender presentation alone divorces the relationship between AGAB and their image of someone who ""looks more like a woman"" or ""looks more like a man"" when they make essentialist statements about AGAB. Like, if this person who is into AFAB nb people was to see someone like F1NN5TER (a cis man streamer who cross dresses and looks very ""AFAB"" even when not cross dressing), they would probably be like ""Ooooh look at this cute AFAB non binary person!""
Seriously. I responded to that in good faith but holy shit. I don’t think they understand that an AFAB non binary person could have any presentation/gender. They act like all AFAB non binary ppl are “women lite” it’s very frustrating.
I rarely post on non-binary communities anymore. Not sure if it’s because I’m older Gen X/Millennial Cusper but I just find it all exhausting and moronically ironic that we literally call ourselves non-binary and yet seem to be the most sensitive and up-tightly sensitive labelist cohort of humans and found myself more isolated and alone for the ordeal. So yes to answer your question, AGAB is a bunch of bullshit that completely misses the point.
I went through a phase recently where this tendency really got to me. I tried for a while to avoid saying anything that might reveal my AGAB. 

The problem with that is that I value discussions about medical transition, and that's the one context where talking about assigned gender is unavoidable. So I've relented. 

Still drives me crazy though. I am not my AGAB. And neither are enbies with the opposite assigned gender.
It's so rampant even when it's not relevant. Like, I just a post today that was like ""AFAB folks who've had a hysterectomy..."" Why did you need to specify? Who else would have gotten a hysterectomy? Stop putting us in boxes.
Asking someone’s agab is just the new “nice” way of asking what’s in their pants
Reposting this list of ways ppl use the term “AFAB.” First two apply to “AMAB” as well

1. A one-to-one replacement for “female” that completely misses the point in terms of trans inclusion
(see: AFAB healthcare, AFAB bodies)

2. A reductive, invasive, and often unwanted label to categorize trans people 
(see: but are you AFAB nonbinary or AMAB nonbinary?)

3. A label that is chosen, but only to indicate that someone is the “good” and “safe” kind of nonbinary (hello, transmisogyny)
(see: AFAB seeking AFAB)

With that said, I’d prefer my doctor to say “You were assigned female at birth, right” than “Are you biologically female” because I believe the first one has more respect for gender AND sex as things that can change and as things that, when assigned at birth, don’t define your identity forever.
Yeah, I've seen this come up on tumblr a lot recently and it just pisses me off. Stop asking people what their agab is, you're just once again being bioessentialist and asking about genitals. That's all it ever is and it's to separate people into having the Good Gender's Genitals and the Bad Gender's Genitals.
It’s not just other subs. I see posts here all the time where people mention their AGAB. Frequently, but not always, next to the words “for context” but the “context” is almost never needed. Sometimes it is relevant to mention, and this sub should be a place where you can mention it when that context is relevant. But people mention it waaaaaaaaaay too much and I get dysphoric everytime someone drops their AGAB “for context” when the context just isn’t needed to understand their post. Especially when the common element amongst NonBinary folk and the over riding context of communication in this sub is that WE ARE NOT OUR AGAB.
Yeah i see that a lot too, it's really annoying.

Especially for intersex people i would assume, where that doesn't even say much in the first place.
Yeah most of the time I don't understand why people have to specify their gender when it's not relevant to the topic, and it makes even less sense to tell your agab out of context. I don't try to hide my sex or gender but I don't go around telling it to people when it literally adds nothing to the conversation
My hot take is that this insistence within the LGBTQIA+ community on separating AFAB and AMAB nbs is the birth of Terfism 2.0
**laughs in transneutral and and how many times i’ve explained to people that yes, that’s a label.**

they’re also shocked i’m transitioning medically as a nonbinary person with mixed bottom surgery/i’m on all testosterone+estrogen+progesterone
This right here. I’ve never felt comfortable being gendered. I’ve only felt compelled to compromise because I lacked the ability to express myself. Mostly because I’m just a big ???
Fr. I feel like AGAB should rarely be brought up and if it is it should be brought up by the trans person talking about themselves. It is useful in some situations but in most it’s just degrading.
I def think that bringing it up where it isn’t necessary to discuss is problematic. I only really see it as helpful when explaining things that have to do with ones AGAB (for example, binding, types of hrt, things that vary depending on AGAB). Using it as an additional label outside these contexts does totally defeat the purpose of being nonbinary and adds gentials essentially into a discussion where they don’t belong and we’ve been trying to take them out of for a while to view gender more holistically
The thing that makes me most annoyed is if someone uses the claim ""afabs experience x and amabs experience y"" in their arguments. Because usually, that format is describing some privilege that one AGAB got and another didn't. It reduces the conversation to genitals, denies individual experiences that don't fit, and feels like an excuse to misgender people. I hate AFAB being applied to me by other people in a context to say I have important things in common with cis women that I somehow can't have in common with any trans women or transfem enbies. It's okay to say because I'm transmasc maybe I understand something women experience, but not ""you're AFAB so you must get it"" because I transitioned as a teenager and usually, I don't get it. And if I did, it would be as a nonbinary man with empathy for someone else's problems. The way some people use AMAB/AFAB sort of claims that I know more about womanhood than a trans woman actually living as a woman, and I never claimed to know anything about womanhood.
Agreed. My AGAB is irrelevant unless I bring it up, I am nonbinary.
If i dont say my agab a lot of people will not consider what i have to say worth listening to. I couldnt possibly know anything about womens rights issues without proving that i used to be woman. Idk it sucks but i actually (unattached to my socials or whatever) tell different people that i hve different agabs that way no one knows the truth lol. Ofc im honest with my friends but so many people just never find out what i was born as and thats how it should be. The only people who should know whats in my pants are me and my bf.
The problem in that link isn't with the category, it's playing gatekeeping games about whether loving a trans person is consistent with such and such sexual identity. 

Personally -- as much as I want to be a post-gender bog goblin -- my history and life is constructed and politicized for me whether I want it or not. So it's necessary to talk about things like HRT experience and transmisogyny with other people who have similar experiences.
At this point its like they’re saying “the girl nonbinary or the boy nonbinary” and its so frustrating
Yep. Don’t like it when my agab is even brought up, it only seems relevant if someone is trying to pigeonhole me back into a binary gender.
Agreed. Granted, I do lean closer to my AGAB than to manhood, but that doesn't make me a woman. Yes, I am biologically female, but please, for the love of garlic bread (my new favorite phrase), I am not a woman! (usually)

And regarding the linked post, that's not lesbian. How can you be attracted solely to AFAB non-binary people, when AFAB non-binary present in wildly different ways? Some look androgynous, some look feminine, some could, for all intents and purposes, completely pass as a man.
I fucking HATE this. Ppl also talk a lot about ‘AMAB’ nb people and the ways they experience being nb and I’m literally over here like… okay I’m AFAB/intersex and nb but that’s how I experience it too since I’m transitioning and read as a cis (sometimes GNC) man 99% of the time. Why are we still categorising based on AGAB? Why not just say, like, male-passing nb people? Or masc nb people? Same with people who talk about ‘AFAB’ nb people as if we’re hysterical women. Sometimes even ‘nb-supportive’ LGBT people. Lichrally just transphobia and misogyny.
I have also seen people dividing NB people by their birth sex in order to treat them pretty much as “basically female” or “basically male”. I think people often fail to realise, maybe based on their limited experience with NB people, that not all NB people look like their birth sex just with different pronouns or whatever, and even within all AFAB non binary people there’s gonna be a huge range of gender identity and expression. I don’t think you can really say you’re “attracted to AFAB non binary people” when there’s so much variation within them that it doesn’t really mean anything except that you reduce NB people to their AGAB.
we feel the same, honestly have more in common with an ""amab"" nb than others. gender is such a stupid thing and the binaries people try to put forward really don't exist. there's maleness, femaleness, nbness, any amount of things in me and everyone and i'm not an opposite to someone else either because of my agab or my identity.
I personally don’t mind when people tell me they “thought I was amab” because it just means I look neutral enough for people to get confused, but other than that I ignore the whole gender thing entirely and would prefer if others did the same.
I really hate when people bring up agab of others. It's fine to use it for yourself in certain contexts but don't label others based on your assumptions, especially in a non binary subreddit.
Agreed. It feels like just another way to phrase the question ""but what are you REALLY??"" AGAB is waaaay less relevant to most discussions than people are comfortable admitting.
Yeah it's always super inappropriate and invalidating to refer to any trans persons AGAB. Only refer to them as the gender they're currently presenting as and do not inquire them or bring up their AGAB. If people want to refer to their own AGAB that's up to them, not to anyone else.
Nonbinary and trans people should not be referring to each other/referred to in general as their assigned gender at birth, at least in my opinion. Almost seems like outing them in some instances. The only time I refer to anyone's agab, it's mine, and only if 1) it's specifically necessary to the conversation and 2) it's around people who know my agab already. It's kind of an ""I can say it about myself but you shouldn't say it about me"" type thing imo
i try to never mention it, even in irl, unless its absolutely necessary, and 9 times out of 10, it isnt. on the internet i can just *be nonbinary,* and irl, i just kinda try to forget about my agab
Idk but yall but im anbab
Yeah me and one of my friends have talked about how amab and afab pretty much just reproduces the binary. It makes more sense to just be like I’m transfem and non-binary rather than using the agab binary. Even now I’m finding that my feelings around my gender identity are changing more as I’ve gotten on hrt and I’m starting to identify more with genderqueer and gender-fluid.
I agree with you that people shouldn't make that big a deal of it, it does make nonbinary a little less nonbinary. For me personally the amab afab thing is more medical, like it doesn't have an impact on me unless its medical , it describes my sex.
It's so tiring tbh. I mean yeah, It's useful in some aspects, but sometimes it tends to fall in the ""Are you a BOY non-binary, or a GIRL non-binary?""category. And people do it so much, that it feels tiring.
> I just don't see why agab should be relevant much, by mentioning it, it feels like erasing the non-binary gender identity and turning it into: male lite and female lite.

Only online do I have a choice not to mention it. In real life, everyone can tell what my AGAB was. I was socialized as that gender for several decades, and am still basically always seen that way in public despite my presentation going hard the other direction. My agab definitely has effected my path through the queer community since I first identified as a lesbian and identify with the history of nonbinary identities in that community, and still relate to the concept of butch as a gender. I am sure it would have been a very different experience if I identified as a straight male first. Plus for some people physical body parts are important to attraction such as the post you linked. I’m not going to shame people for whom my physical sex characteristics matter, even if they don’t match my internal gender identity. Other times it’s useful to separate to talk about the experience of transitioning away from a certain gender; the things I do to look more androgynous in general will be opposite to what an AMAB person would do.

None of these things are about my gender identity. I definitely don’t see myself as male or women lite, my identity is fully nonbinary. But my body, my history, my socialization, the way my transition is viewed, my physical safety - all these things ARE effected. Identity is only one facet of the way we experience gender and I’m not going to pretend that it is. 

I guess to give an example, trans women are women, but sometimes it is useful for them to mention they are trans or speak to transfems specifically because they are addressing something specific to that experience. I think with being nonbinary this can be even more extreme because you can’t ever really pass as nonbinary so the way you are seen can be even more important.
Personally, I see it as helpful to other people to get a better idea of my experiences, as life can be very different for enbies depending on how they were perceived at a young age, and the expectations they grew up having put upon them.
Exactly! I think some people have a hard time describing their attraction to enbies in a way that’s affirming. And as a commenter on your linked post said, that just means they’re not ready to date nonbinary folks. I have also struggled with this in the past, I have *absolutely* hurt nonbinary friends of mine, but there is just a limit to what’s acceptable. If there is a limit to the amount of masculine presentation that you find attractive *then just say that*! AGAB has *nothing* to do with attraction, not even for folks who like to cluck about “genital preference”. Enbies can get bottom surgery too, and I know several who will and have!
When someone makes a point of specifying their/someone else's agab it just feels like the binary with extra steps
I agree entirely.
It’s just gender essentialism with extra steps.
The only place my AGAB could even be remotely relevant is in the doctors office. And even then not every medical professional needs to know it(looking at you dentists)
but, and just hear me out on this, what if i need to make a bunch of assumptions about someone but i can't tell what their genitals looked like when they were born? what then? /s
God this is like my biggest pet peeve in the queer community.

For real, i hear cis people all the time talking about their trans kids and they ALWAYS seem to have to clarify ""they were born as X but they decided they wanted to be y"", like it matters so much to the conversation. 

Even some queer people seem to do this but are more subtle with it, like I've heard my roommate say stuff like ""my friend she's trans MTF"", which is just so redundant. I know they're trans, you don't have to go stating where they started. 

It just feels like such a violation of someones privacy when people state it.

If you're looking for a way to explain it to cis people easily: ""AMAB/AFAB is something someone can be, it is NOT something you use to group people by."" - I came up with that one when my cis queer roommate said ""I've mostly dated AMAB people""
I strongly prefer that people do not know my agab. It's not relevant and it makes me super dysphoric - it's literally no one's business but mine, my partner's, and my doctor's.
It is, to put it mildly, a bit cringe.
 our biological sex is going to influence how others perceive our genders or how we go through the world. a nonbinary person born male isn't going to have the same experiences as one born female. I don't inherently see what's bad about pointing out the difference in very specific conversations, but yeah I agree that is how it's viewed as and i dislike it alot. Similarly I'll often see it used as diet trans woman/diet trans man which I'm not a fan of either.

 Since you mentioned being transfem it brings back to what I was saying how we're often grouped as diet binary trans. transfem is used to refer to both trans women as well as male sexed nonbinary people who either have a more feminine expression or transitioning in a similar fashion to trans woman. vice versa with transmasc and female sexed nonbinary folks. the issue I've often come across is the assumption that every male enby by default is transfem or every female enby is transmasc. it still unnecessarily forces us into a binary based on our bio sex.

 controversial opinion time!! I don't believe the terms transfem/transmasc should inherently be linked to birth sex. those terms should be self descriptive to the individual, not prescribed by others.
Separating it can allow people to share their experiences of things like hormones and surgeries with a certain genitalia with people who also could have the same results. It's like splitting ftm and mtf they both are trans but have different types of transitions. Nonbinary people can transition. And having a place to share their transition of their agab to the person they want to be. Not every nb person transitions, or transitions the same. But it's nice to see what people have decided and some can even do the same. They could find a surgery for a part of a agab body that isn't commonly put out there or is buried in a sea of things they don't relate to. Some nb people (like myself) join ftm or mtf subreddits to see people with the same body as them and see how different things in transition or with being trans happens to people with a certain genitali.
I maintain that your AGAB is better you and your doctor. Anyone else in your life you tell is optional, or I guess if anyone you knew pre coming out is still in your life.
It’s pretty exhausting when cis people just see you as your AGAB. It’s so refreshing and such a relief to be around non-cis people.
agreed, i usually only mention my agab when it’s in regards to my experience with medical issues (how my body functions) and/or social responses that i still have as a result of being raised my birth gender.
There Definitely Are Contexts Where It Can Be Relevant Information, For Example (Sometimes) When Someone Is Talking About Their Own Transition Or Experience. If I'm Talking About How I Felt Growing Up For Example It Could Be Useful To Know I'm AMAB. That Said I'll Definitely Agree It's Somewhat Overused Too. (Based Solely On The Title Of The Post You Linked I'm Skeptical Of It As A Whole, Although I Suppose Ignoring That I Would Agree It's Not A Good Use Of The Term.)
Yeah I only ever mention my agab if its necessary, which is rarely. Sometimes its obvious bc of context (posts/comments about my own experiences and body for example) but I almost never explicitly say whats going on the pants.

Just know that according to buzzfeed, I'm 8"" 😤 /lh
As someone who is (just literally now) realizing that they're absolutely not cis, I'm also sick of people trying to figure out what they think nonbinary/gender nonconforming people actually are. I personally find myself completely separate from my agab. Yes, I still have the plumbing I came with but I really hate it when people look at me only through the eyes of something I've had no control over -- when they place restrictions and expectations on me based on who they  see. 

I'm not even mad at people asking for my help because I'm amab -- I've had a lot of practice. I'd gladfully walk someone home at night or tell some random man to get lost. Male privilege is absolutely real -- and although I'm always glad to make others happy, I feel moderate  dysphoria being called a ""man"" (or acting as the ""man""). This ""male lite"" is exactly how I have been categorized (even by myself) and it's never fit right. 

I know it's oversimplifying, but I felt like gender was a spectrum -- from m to f -- and everyone was somewhere on that line. I now realize that honestly, I feel so disconnected from the idea of gender entirely. I am just a brain wandering around earth; which bathroom do brains use? Am I a gender? Am I agender? I'm just me -- what is so hard for people to grasp?

\[all rhetorical questions\]
We need to get rid AMAB and AFAB because people are incapable of being normal about it
This reminds me of something that happened at the beginning of the school year. I'm a high school teacher, and I had just played Deltarune at the end of the summer. I fell in love with the game, so I had a wallpaper of Kris as my desktop background, which showed on the smart board before class started. One of my students walked in, and the first thing out of their mouth was, ""is that a boy or a girl?"" I'm afraid to use terms like ""nonbinary"" at work because I live in a super conservative state, so I said something like, ""they're not a boy or a girl."" The student asked again. I don’t understand why people insist on putting even fictional characters in a gender box the second they see them. Kris's gender wasn't relevant *at all* in that moment. It was just a cool image of them.
Tbh I just don’t tell people my AGAB. It’s like a fun little puzzle for them to figure it out themselves
So fucking true, I've been thinking about this for ages!
I mean, all those people talking about afab NB ukuleleplayers are just calling them women, that's it. Whenever some mentions an NB's agab like it's relevant, that's just indirect misgendering.
I use ""afab"" when referring to the social/medical specifics of being Nb, there is a major difference there (surgery, perceptions, etc). But otherwise I'm just ""enby"".
I mean with regards to the post you referenced, it's clear the person is really just referring to nonbinary people with vaginas. They are asking a valid question but I think their wording was maybe a little off.

They could probably just say ""am I still a lesbian if I'm attracted to nonbinary people with vaginas"" instead. Maybe they just want to avoid the vulgarity/admitting that their issue ultimately comes down to genitals.

I find in a lot of situations like this, people are only referring to your AGAB as a shorthand for referring to what genitals you have. Like I have been asked if I would be gay if I dated a cis gay man because I'm AMAB (have a penis), or if a cis straight men is attracted to me does that make him gay because I'm AMAB (have a penis). I don't see it as much as being put into categories as people trying to talk about genitals in a ""polite"" way.
In general, I think it's only relevant when it comes to how the world perceives you or for medical reasons. As much as I would like to be this middle ground that confuses everyone, I present very female (albeit a ""tomboy female""), and I understand sometimes it affects people's perspective of me. 

I understand both sides of the example you give - the poster and your own. The problem I have within the example you gave is that they're being general; they're discussing any ""AFAB NB"" people, not a specific one, which.. to me... seems like they don't fully accept someone's NB identity.
Right that's exactly what people are doing with AGABs.

Transfem/transmasc or AFAB/AMAB are useful terms in relation to talking about transitioning and personal experiences but ya no one but the individual person should be referring to their AGAB.

Especially because a lot of the time people are guessing at which one someone is and doesnt take into account that nb ppl transition.
Same kind of deal at my uni. They were grouping women and non binary together in like book sessions or pool sessions, as if they just see non binary as woman lite™️ (someone in the lgbt society put it that way and they weren’t wrong). They’ve now changed the pool session to have a totally separate one for trans and non binary people after people complained and raised their concerns.
I agree. The interesting thing (to me), is that when I express disagreement that our AGAB should have any bearing on the label we use for ourselves, a *lot* of trans people get really upset. For example, in my opinion, if a person is a feminine trans person, they should be able to access and use the term transfem for themselves, and vice versa with transmasc, regardless of AGAB. I don’t agree that our AGAB (an incorrect assumption about our bodies) should have a bearing on the term we use for ourselves now.
There are so many titles/labels that help each individual navigate through how they themselves feel. Non-binary to me means something different than it does to you, or the next person.  Point being, we each have our own thoughts on what each of these labels mean to us now, and how they relate to us in the past.  There is no point in being pissed off because you don’t agree with how someone else views a a labels context… if it doesn’t work for you then brush it off and move along.  Now if someone is using the terms in order to purposefully discredit how someone feels then you know that person is an asshole.  Idk.  Just how I roll with all the labels where nothing fits anyone anymore.
I’m not entirely sure how I feel about agab but for me depending on the situation I use afab when it’s necessary
Assigned gender is still VERY relevant, even to non-binary people.  We have to recognize that it's part of who we are, not ignore it.  This is why while my gender is non-binary and fluid, I still choose to label myself as ""female"" in recognition of my sex, because it influences how others view me and the assumptions they might make, and so on.

It largely determines what our bodies look like and how they function.

It informs how we are socialized while growing up, the toys and games people purchase for us, the way they talk to us, the things parents allow us to do.

It affects how we navigate through and experience the world - a transfem person, for example, would probably (depending on age) not have experienced things like being told to dress a certain way to ""be more appropriate"" or ""attract boys"".  But, as someone who passes for a cis woman, I've probably never experienced the fear or apprehension a transfem person might have on using a public bathroom.  Etc., etc.

We are certainly more than our assigned gender, but when we're talking about experiences and how we interact with the world, that still has a LOT of influence.
I don’t really get it either. It’s only important in medical matters or maybe in the CICO sub I joined (calories in, calories out) because the metabolisms are different
yeah i only think it’s relevant if you’re talking about something specific to being raised as your agab- like experiencing sexism toward girls/women even if you’re non-binary
From a personal perspective, I agree that agab isn't often relevant in many cases of nonbinary discourse. However, I feel that spaces for it do exist, especially considering that the distinction of sex and gender have been profoundly misunderstood by many people for such a long time. As an anthropologist, the anthropology of gender has always been quite interesting to me, and perhaps from an anthropological perspective I become more open to the distinction of afab and amab regarding certain topics of discussion. In the post you linked for example, I could personally view it as being rather irrelevant, but considering how in many societies, sexuality is often defined in relation to one's own gender, then defining one's sexuality can become much more complicated when you're gender-nonconforming. So people may turn to defining their sexuality based on their assigned gender because it helps to conceptualize their own sexuality. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with this, but I do feel more terms should either be created or popularized as to avoid the need to rely on one's own agab in this respect. I think this same idea applies in many areas actually, that it's not so much a problem within LGBT spaces as much as it is a product of overall society itself not accommodating the people who don't identify with their agab. Essentially, society didn't think of a way to accommodate us, so we have to use our own spaces, and sometimes include agab discourse to make our gender (or lack thereof) make sense to ourselves.
AGREE. Drives me crazy. If you want to keep a space leaning one way or the other then say fem-aligned/masc-aligned non-binary people, not afab/amab!
Unless a discussion has specifically to do with socialized-female/male experiences or specific medical issues, in which case be specific that that’s what you’re talking about.
This is why I dislike queer discourse that attempts to strictly define sexuality labels. I’m nonbinary and a lesbian, but what does that really mean? It’s just a close-enough label that captures my attraction model, which excludes men, but I’m often extremely attracted to masculine enbies, and if I dated one, that wouldn’t suddenly make them a woman or non-masculine or anything of the sort. It’s just stupid and ridiculous to be so nitpicky; when gender can’t be defined within those strict boundaries, neither can sexuality.
I think it can be a good thing to mention when you're talking about your experiences to someone and your journey. Also to give context about different situations and hardships that one may come by as a non-binary person. Its all about understanding people isn't it? So why pretend like we weren't all assigned a gender at birth and ignore it's influence. Other than that I fully agree with you.
Fr.  Even as an afab person, when people do this, they usually don’t see me as enby, just “butch light” or “dyke lite” and will prob misgender me later, cos deep down they really just see me as a woman.  So yeah, agab is tiring af.  I don’t think it really helps us at all in the end
My partner deals with the same issue when talking to others about me. I had asked her to use they/them with people who don't know me directly, as my gender identity is fluid. She was talking with someone and they asked if her partner was a boy or girl, and she replied nonbinary. Then the person asked ""No, what are they *really*"" which pissed her off because the person had seemed more supportive of trans people initially. I feel like the issue is a total erasure of a person's identity as people only use the correct pronouns to appease someone.
The only thing I think that changes is where life punches you the most. Although I would like to look and consequently behave more feminene (I feel uncomfortable behaving as such when I see myself masculine, I know not all are as such.) I can't, I am expected to not be emotional etc. I have a non binary friend who is trying to unleash their masculinity. Although we have similar concerns regarding the society, and ultimately we are emotionally and mentally similar, we suffer from slightly different pre-programmed minds of our ours.

Though you see I haven't explicitly mentioned our gender at birth, although you probably can infer.


I would say, it has contextual relevance, though it isn't necessary to state when there's not an actual need.
I'm nonbinary, and yes it's a little annoying. I just don't like the amab/afab tags at all and I wish we'd all stop using them entirely.
THIS. And I also see other enbies state their AGAB, basing it on ‘diff socialisations’. It’s fine if you wanna state your AGAB - but I don’t like this explanation, for one- it prolly changes place to place. Never seen my desi guy and girl friends socialise like my yt friends and vice versa. Nothing wrong in either- just that I’ve been most anti-social before finding my identity and just really started talking in general to more people after I started figuring things and feeling more- closer, to me
To play devils advocate, genital preference is definitely a major issue for some people and the only real way to talk about it is AFAB/AMAB. But I agree people shouldn't be posting stuff like that to the sub, as it is insensitive.
Ye that's weird. When introducing a nonbinary/trans person it seems kinda invalidating to say their AGAB. Like i wouldn't want people knowing that bc people tend to use it against me if their homophobic.
People also do this with transmasc/fem, which is why I'm hesitant to use the terms. 

Sometimes if I introduce myself as nonbinary, the followup question if I'm transmasc/fem or """"regular"""" nonbinary (aka enby who presents in a way correlated to their gab), which only feels 2 steps away from whats in my pants.
Exactly! Same. We have ALLLLLL been influenced by our AGAB in social and medical ways, beginning on the first day of our lives. To deny this reality is borderline delusional. I don’t identify as my AGAB, obviously - I’m nb. BUT it has inherently influenced many aspects of my reality and sometimes I need to disclose that if I want to discuss those very real parts of my reality. It’s not ideal - but it’s real. I miss when nuance was a part of discourse. I fear how much we have thrown it out the window.
The problem with that is that it ignores class/race/nationality/literally every other intersection that gives ALL people very different experiences of being ""raised as"" or assigned a gender. What you attribute to being assigned (x) at birth is just as attributable to your income level, where you live, your culture, and your race as anything else. So trying to talk about experiences like they're shared by all people who were assigned the same gender is still not really clarifying anything. A rich white woman who grew up in Massachusetts, USA, and a poor black woman who grew up in the rural Appalachias, are gonna have two *drastically* different expectations placed upon them as women and may have nothing in common based on assigned gender, even if they're both cis women.
Me too! I’m nonbinary (obviously) & I use she/her exclusively, because I’m AFAB, people think I’m cis & I get invalidated a lot as a nonbinary person. My AGAB is super relevant to my experience with gender, I won’t mention it any less than I do because it’s relevant to *me*. I don’t care what other people’s AGABs are if they don’t care, I only care if it’s relevant & something *they* care about. If someone mentions their AGAB, that shouldn’t affect me, that’s their experience & not really any of my business. Although obviously no nonbinary person should be boiled down to their AGAB, that I absolutely agree with.
I don't think people ""forget"" these things. There are alot of humans who don't even know that themselves to begin with. Education is one thing, but how would people even find such info or even end up where these are discussed in the first place.

Being Non binary for me is just existing as a human.  So I agree with keeping Amab and AFAB terms to the minimum until it's truly understood.
Yeah I thought it was a bit odd too, like whenever people talk about that I always wonder, does that really include someone like me who's on T, eventually getting top, and hoping for eventual SR metoidioplasty? I mean my genitalia will be more in-between than anything, but everything else? And then *what*, in that case, would make me more desirable to said lesbian than, say, a transfem non-binary person who's on E and had bottom surgery?

I tend to think that, generally, quantifying your attraction to enbies based solely on our ASAB is a slippery slope at best, and not a great idea, because we really are all so different.
Literally my biggest pet peeve is the ‘woman lite’ idea
I present “woman lite” most times, and still find this kind of mentality upsetting. I would, at the very least, raise an eyebrow if someone had said this to me irl and then said they find me attractive. Just because I present myself as slightly off center female, does not mean I am a female, and I get frustrated quite often when people don’t understand the difference.
Just repackaged terf rhetoric. You know she only sees non-binary people as their agab and nothing more.
[deleted]
Only i'm getting so tired of labels myself as a prime millennial when it comes to this, along with disability as I feel too many people are quick to judge me without giving me enough time to understand my quirks.
I put in extra effort to not give away my agab because it makes me so dysphoric. I didn't mind people knowing in the past because I didn't feel like it mattered, but now I know how fixated people are on it. 

Feels invalidating for sure, but also invasive and perverted for people to care so much.
""People who have had hysterectomys... Yes I'm looking at you AMAB's"" 🤣
Seriously.
I don't have agab, only BEES 🐝
AGAB was started in the intersex community. its basically whatever they decided to put on our birth certificate which would then result in unnecessary medical procedures to fit that gender. it was really only created to help describe the type of medical abuse we received. the trans community started using it but im seeing more and more trans people unhappy with how it's being used
yup. i'm old enough to have seen this type of terf behavior in LGBTQIA+ spaces online for 10 years or more.
Defeats the purpose according to *whom?* From my perspective the whole purpose was NOT just to create a third category just for agender and third-gender persons, but to recognize the fluidity and intersectionality of gender as a constructed thing. This was *explicitly* inclusive of traditional queer gender subcultures and expressions. One of my inspirations here is Les Feinberg, who was a butch lesbian, trans man, and nonbinary person all in one. 

I'm feeling uncomfortable with the repeated ask in this subreddit for people who use words referencing AGAB to only talk about binding, etc.. That comes off as hella essentialist and gatekeepy,
or “socialization” i wasnt “socialized afab” i was socialized AUTISTIC goooooo fuck yourself
100% this. why i avoid stating amab/afab or referencing the agab binary. i avoid people who communicate their agab regularly online or in their profiles too b/c, like you said, it just reproduces the binary.
Uh...question: why'd you capitalize everything? xD

The capitalization somehow activated some kind of dyslexia or something within me, making it impossible for me to read this. 💀
As for the spectrum…….even conceiving of non-binary as a spectrum between ‘man’ and ‘woman’ doesn’t capture what being non-binary means. It’s not androgyny (though some want to present androgynously), nor a third sex, nor just ‘in between’. Non-binary is the entire universe of gender-space that’s not the two binary genders. Non-binary people can embody masculinity and femininity on separate axes, along with axes of other gender qualities not described by masculinity or femininity; more of one does not mean less of the others. Some non-binary people have gender experiences that nothing to do with the binary genders (for example, look up “maverique”).
There are amab people with vaginas, why couldn't they just say ""I'm attracted to non-binary people (with a preference for vaginas)"" instead?
Wait wait, so they made a separate session for binary trans people as well? That's kinda depressing.
The issue is that everyone knows that ""transfem"" and ""transmasc"" mostly mean the direction of transition.

If someone who is afab and says they're transfem enters a transfem space, they will not relate to any of the things in said space.

Now...its a completely different story when we say that one can be trans AND masculine or trans AND feminine.
speak for yourself
This ignores a lot of things, like race and class and nationality, that also impact people's experience of gender. There is no shared ""afab experience"" and the people who insist there is tend to be white cis feminists who ignore intersectionality.

I guarantee that there are AFAB people who had entirely different standards and expectations on them than you had, who had different experiences of sexed bodies and misogyny, who do not view themselves as essentially ""female"" in any way.
I can understand that, for some people (such as yourself), that element of your identity is important to you even as a non-binary person. I mostly just want to add what I think a lot of people tend to forget especially about non-binary people, that some of us can and do medically transition, and that can have a significant impact on how we're treated socially as well as what biological experiences we have.

So for me, I still sometimes have reason to specify my ASAB, but I expect it will become less relevant as I get further along in transition. And typically I prefer to be more specific because even another AFAB person may have different experiences depending on a whole variety of factors. So I'd rather say, for example, ""as someone who was raised as a girl,"" or, ""as someone who can get pregnant,"" than just AFAB.

I also am much more averse to bringing it up in certain spaces, as I find it just gives transphobes (transmed variety especially) more ammo to use against me. People are usually more chill about it in non-binary spaces ime but I also only tend to hang out in the kind of nbi spaces that would be. I'm probably more personally averse to alignment terms (like transmasc, transfem) for myself than ASAB, tbh. But that could just be cuz I'm maverique. 🤷🏻
All of this goes out the window if you actually consider intersex people in your worldview for a minute.
I struggle with how to accept help that is explicitly intended to help women in male-dominated / sexist environments. I usually get read as a butch / gender non-conforming woman, meaning that I have dealt with the same sexism that women do my entire life. I want and/or need the same sort of help and support that women do!

I've been erring on the side of just sucking it up and participating in ""women in X"" type of events, because it's a lot easier than trying to get the names changed to ""victims of the patriarchy in physics social"" or ""improv workshop for people who were trained in childhood to be quiet and deferential"".
even to *some* nonbinary people. for others it isn't relevant at all. the biggest problem I think is using them as generalities or assuming what we have in common because of what genitals we had as infants.
[deleted]
I agree with you about a lot of this. The gender I was assigned at birth is insanely relevant to how I have experienced the world thus far - how others have perceived me and treated me, the privileges I have had or haven’t had, the role within my family throughout my childhood, my socialization, etc. The list goes on. Ideally, sex wouldn’t impact those things. But we don’t live in an ideal world just yet, unfortunately. The reality is, being AFAB means I experience the world differently than I would had I been AMAB. It means that I have been socialized during my most formative developmental years in a way that I would not have been had I been AMAB. It’s delusional to pretend that this isn’t a FACT. That doesn’t mean I’m not nonbinary. I don’t identify as female or male. I don’t view the world through that lens. The issue is, people in our community have absolutely thrown the concept of nuance out the window. It prevents them from acknowledging the uncomfortable grey areas of reality.
I don't quite understand.
What is a ""socialized-female"" experience? 🤔
I've also struggled with this exact (yet opposite) dilemma. I love the term ""queer"" in these instances, but it also requires explanation I typically don't want to explain (to straight people who I really could give less of a f about)
Thing is...it's assuming that all afab people have vaginas and that all amab people have penises...it's better to say ""Am I a lesbian if I like non-binary people with a preference for pussy?""
I agree with everything you're saying, but I don't think that invalidates OP's point. She's not saying that nb people shouldn't disclose their agab, just that people shouldn't reduce a nb person to only their agab. It's one thing to talk about your experiences with dysphoria, medical stuff, etc with the context of your agab, if that context is important to understanding the story. If I talk about how buying bras makes me uncomfortable, that can mean something very different depending on whether I'm afab or amab.  
It's a completely different thing to lump nb people in with their agab, like how if I go out with female friends it's ""girls' night"" but if my cis husband goes with us then it's not. Or ""I'm [straight/gay] but I'd date a nb person if they still look and act like a [man/woman]."" They're completely missing the point of what it means to be nb.
I don't think this is what OP was saying. The post they linked was someone asking if they're still a lesbian if they're attracted to afab nonbinary people, which (hopefully) I don't need to explain why isn't a great or validating way to word it. Nobody's saying what you were assigned at birth has no affect on anything, but the way people use afab/amab is often not necessary or even *correct*. You can use it but also don't get offended when other nonbinary people have problems with it.
In some ways yes, but not entirely. You can't say ""oh because this person was AFAB they *only* have been influenced *this* way"". Many non binary people *do* transition and end up passing as a sex other than their AGAB. A transfeminine non binary person who passes as a woman will likely encounter a lot of the same harassment and misogyny that it common for AFAB people. And in my case, yes, I was AFAB, but you would be very blatantly wrong if you told me I haven't been heavily socialized as male.

Socialization doesn't end when you hit puberty or when you turn 18. There are very few things that are *only* causational down to AGAB. For social things, there will almost always be an exception to any generalized statement you make. You are better off just saying ""people socialized in x way"" rather than trying to categorize it as strictly AGAB.
I don't see how the original post is lacking in nuance. I got the impression they would agree, and are saying it's only \*usually\* not relevant, which I think we all agree on.
I skipped 90 percent of gendered socialization by being autistic and it is infuriating to see people assume that everyone has been socialized a certain way when it is just not goddamn true.
I'm not saying anything about boiling experiences down to a gender. I'm saying that I have experiences of my own that were influenced by the gender society saw me as, just like almost everyone else does. That's how I use it when I do so. I know other aspects of my identity affect me.
Like you KNOW it doesn’t include that when they say “AFAB non binary person” and they’re asking about the lesbian umbrella They’re trying to say someone that’s fem/andro and probably not on T. And I feel like they’re still thinking of them in a binary gender way. Cause even that doesn’t mean they are women lite, and that person could NOT want to be with lesbians for dysphoria reasons. I’m okay responding to ppl like this cause I want to show people how to change their thinking/break down the binary BUT it’s still soo frustrating.
And you know they're excluding non-binary people like me who've been on E for years, had bottom and other gender related surgeries and look like a queer woman. We're not our agab and reducing us down to our agab or asab is hurtful and  in many cases completely misleading.
Verrry frustrating. I’m tired of people trying to make non binary a monolith 3rd gender where our AGABs are still brought into it.
Labels have purpose and are important to have. It’s when labels become stereotyping tools that it becomes an issue. But labels give us the vocabulary of explaining our experience in a way that’s not exhausting or requiring of a college lecture length discussion.

If it wasn’t for the label of nonbinary, I’d still be struggling to understand myself and explain my lived experience to others. And it would have been nearly impossible to find a community of others who are just like me.

That said, reducing people to their labels is an -ism like any other. Sexism, racism, etc.
ABAB (ed: assigned bees at birth)
Exactly. It’s also frustrating because now people tend to only understand AGAB in the context of trans spaces and don’t realize or care that it started with intersex people and meant something completely different to begin with. I’m intersex too and was forcibly altered at birth, so it’s just also extremely frustrating for me personally because it’s something I’ve also dealt with a *lot* too.  

Honestly it’s also often harmful because this distinction is not considered, and often people just want to know *”whats in your pants?”* rather than what your actual biology is.
I’m actually fairly young, and fairly new to queer spaces, I only hold my opinion on this subject because I notice a common ideological root in gender bio-essentialism. But could you tell me more about your experience?
To a lot of us…? It’s okay if you want to identify as an AFAB nb person and if you want to place attention on your intersectionality of AGAB and gender identity, but for a lot of the ways people are using AGAB now they’re generalising incorrectly and it winds up just being repackaged transphobia. Not all nb people look like their AGABs, not all of us are comfortable being referred to that way. Saying stuff like “attracted to AFAB nb people” is weird because one AFAB nb person might look more or less just like a man while another might by androgynous whole another might look a lot like a woman. Would they be attracted to all??? Why would they be attracted to an AFAB nb person post-top surgery, on T, who has had bottom surgery but not an AMAB nb person who doesn’t transition medically. Unless they’re assuming AFAB nb = woman nb.
LOL yeah the ""socialized"" argument does not fit me either. I transitioned as a teenager. ""Socialization"" doesn't end at 15 which is when I came out, even if it was a valid argument.
>Uh...question: why'd you capitalize everything? xD

Well, You See, An Evil Microscopic Weevil Has Crawled Inside My Brain And Is Forcibly Activating The Neurons That Cause Me To Capitalise Words, Whether I Like It Or Not, And Preventing Me From Undoing It. 

>The capitalization somehow activated some kind of dyslexia or something within me, making it impossible for me to read this. 💀

~~I can't read it in the first place so I don't have such problems 😎~~

So that you can read it, However, Here it is with *Minimal Capitalisation!!1!*

> There definitely *are* contexts where it can be Relevant Information, For example (sometimes) when someone is talking about their own Transition or Experience. If I'm talking about How I Felt Growing Up, For example it could be useful to know I'm AMAB. That said I'll definitely agree it's somewhat overused too. (Based solely on the title of the post you linked I'm skeptical of it as a whole, Although I suppose ignoring that I would agree it's not a good use of the term.)
This is generally what I discovered myself; I had thought it was just all of the in-between but obviously that's not the case. I seem to be operating in a completely different dimension than gender if you get where I'm coming from..

Looked up maverique, I can immediately relate but for myself I think I feel more comfortable as just nb/agender/queer. Then again some days I feel more gnc/gender fluid. Ugh gender... why you even fucking exist is my question 😅😅
I agree, that's kind of what I said in my comment aha.
I think it might be trans and non binary grouped together, possibly based on how there’s a trans and non binary society within the lgbt society. Basically any non cis person. It’s only had one session this semester tho. It’s a step in the right direction ig? Albeit a small one
I get where you’re coming from but see it differently. 🤷🏻
Totally - assigned gender is just ONE aspect of intersectionality that needs to be considered. And not everyone is going to have the same experience just because they're assigned the same. But it's definitely something that has a big influence in our overall lives. I just don't think it's helpful to try and act like we live in this magical genderless society where assigned gender at birth has zero relevance to anything. It's still a major factor. And most people outside the queer community (hell, even plenty within) don't think that way either. I am someone who is usually perceived to be a cis woman by the general public and that has a huge impact on my daily life - I wish it didn't - but it does and that's just the truth.
Oh yes 100%! And that's included in this concept of ""assigned gender influences your life and worldview"". A person who chooses to medically transition is absolutely going to have totally different experiences than someone who doesn't. But the whole concept of ""transition"", and not just plastic surgery or cosmetic procedures, is BECAUSE we have assigned gender at birth. Which influenced choice to medically transition, or not. And even post transition, the things you experienced in the past because of the birth assignment, are going to influence how you think and feel about things.

I'm totally on board with being annoyed that it's still such a big deal, potentially using different terminology, etc etc. I just definitely don't think that completely ignoring the fact that everyone has a birth assigned gender of some kind and trying to dismiss it as irrelevant is helpful either. In a perfect world, but that's not the one we live in.
What about intersex people invalidates this? They are also impacted by their personal history - how they were socialized, how they are seen by strangers, their history of how they understand their gender, and their physical body. I don’t think intersex people existing means that any of these things aren’t important it just means some people have more complicated experiences
It doesn't, though, because most intersex people are not aware of the condition until later in life or ever. And those that are apparent at birth, historically have had their bodies changed to match the sex the doctors and parents decide on - many times the parents were not even told - and assigned and raised as one of two genders. I really fucking hope that's changing in current birth practices but I'm not sure, I haven't had kids yet or known too many people closely who have. 

I'm a biologist, I'm well aware of intersex people and do consider them in my worldview. In the case of being intersex, yeah, assigned gender won't really hold true to physiology. But the doctor doesn't say ""it's an intersex child!"", they say ""it's a boy"" or ""it's a girl"" and thus, assign a gender. So you mean to tell me that an intersex person who's raised as a certain gender and then very clearly develop differently during puberty, or find out about the ""procedure"" that happened at their birth, or get genetic testing in adulthood to find out why they're infertile and realize their chromosomes and phenotype don't match - you don't think that incorrect assignment and potential trauma would greatly shape an intersex person's life experiences and how they interact with the world? No, it absolutely would. Hence, assigned gender is still relevant to intersex people because it still happens to them.
It might not make sense to you, or the OP apparently, but it does make sense to this *individual* that made the comment you replied to — and to me another Enby who has every right to identify exactly who I am based solely on my knowledge of myself. To say otherwise is where the invalidation occurs. No one is forcing you to disclose if you choose not to, but to specifically try to exclude folx… that seems all about invalidation and gatekeeping to me. I’m non binary because societal gender norms are an anathema to me. I don’t fit either side, and find myself often fully OUTSIDE them. All the same I have no biological dysphoria. So I reason I can (and do) refer to myself as male, but not a man. Sex =/= gender… but I believe this entire thread is predicated on that conflation. Anyway, I’ll probably get downvoted, but I agree with you @birdydevil!
To me it makes no sense to just pretend that this huge part of my experience just doesn’t exist. 

Like I understand that not everyone may feel this way, but I’m seen 100% as my agab despite my best efforts, my history in the queer community & partners are effected by it, I have a certain body with very gendered characteristics. My identity is nonbinary but I can’t stop these other factors from playing a major role in my life.
But at the same time, if you grew up with, for example, breasts, you are likely to have a totally different set of experiences to somebody who did not, whether you identify as non-binary or not. We might not like to be defined by our genitals, but society will do so regardless.  
I also think for NBs who don't use some form of HRT, a person's sex (NOT gender) does influence your moods and physical experience to a certain extent. People who don't menstruate do not have the massive hormonal fluctuations that people who menstruate do, although that's just one example.  


Personally, I'm totally fine with the *SEX I was assigned at birth (female)*, in the sense I'm fine with the body, hormones and chromosomes that I have. What I'm NOT fine with is the *GENDER assigned to me at birth (woman/girl)* and all the social, behavioural, fashion and aesthetic expectations and norms that come with that.   
I'm really glad this discussion got brought up because I've always thought that there should be both AGAB and ASAB (assigned sex at birth) terms, which would make it easier to talk about experiences that are more related to social vs. physical dysphoria as a nonbinary or trans person.
I'm not identifying by my genitals. I'm identifying by my history, which includes growing up with the intense serophobia of the Reagan-Bush era, dating gay bears, receiving abuse because I did not properly perform masculinity, and loosing my entire youth support system when I came out because of religiously sponsored prejudice. 

Which means that, if we're talking about intersectionality, I have shared issues with many cis queer men my age. And on the other side, I have common issues with many transfem people. 

Being genderqueer for me means celebrating our diversity, not creating an entirely new standard of ideological androgyny.
If you genuinely don’t know… much has been already been written, and written well, on the subject, and it would be a waste of time for me to redundantly try to compose something in a reddit comment.
If you’re trying to imply that there aren’t socialized-female experiences (not absolutely universal ones, there are no universal experiences), then it would be an even bigger waste of time for me to get into that debate.
I hear you! I guess we’re all saying the same thing for the most part. None of us want to be reduced to our assigned genders, and yet all of us are impacted by them in some way. Thanks for your comment.
I completely agree with all of you. This is why it's so much easier dating bi/pan people. I hate how it's so natural for people to reduce others to their AGAB in society and make all of these assumptions especially when people present differently than their AGAB.
People making toxic masculinity something _specific to transfems_ makes me gag lmfao. People of any AGAB can experience that one.
I skipped a lot of my gender's socialization by being socially inept, but I still had parts thrust upon me whether I liked it or not. Actually, my attempt to be evaluated as autistic was influenced by my AGAB.
Being Jewish and intersex and poor and mentally ill from a rural southern area affected my socialization as much as my AGAB. The things that happened to me even “because” of my AGAB were different culturally and a lot of people here would find unrelatable consequently.

People project stuff onto their AGAB sometimes and it’s like no, that’s you being raised with cultural christianity I skipped that one and had something completely different, etc.

Then people generalize and, if you bring up these other influences and point out that it’s not universal (that can’t be distanced from your AGAB because culture affects AGAB treatment for example), they say you clearly don’t get it because they _assume you haven’t suffered sufficiently to ‘realize’ how wrong you are_ and it’s like. You literally have no idea who you’re talking to. It’s rude to assume how much people have suffered because you disagree with them to say the least, and inappropriate.
I think this would've been the best start of the convo. It is frustrating.  We are not a monolith. And being NB is definitely not a ""3rd gender"". And many even non binaries struggle to have this line of thinking  but we will get there as long as the thought provocation to it persists. Even ifnits exhausting. It's a serious matter
I understand what you’re saying and am not trying to discount it, however I disagree that the label of non-binary itself is what allowed you to understand yourself and explain your existence to others. Gender-nonconforming people have done that with and without specific terminology in various cultures for years, and the language has just evolved and changed. Even the gender identities have evolved and changed. And, they might still do so. (I think this is true for *all* gender identities.)

I think a lot of people feel some sort of pressure to find the right fit of a label, panic when they don’t find one, and also enforce other people’s labels on them, whether they are self-assigned or not. And that’s because we were basically all raised in a society that has done that to us since birth with this comphet patriarchy, forcing us to see ourselves and everyone as either a male boy or a female girl, and putting that before their identity as a human being. The labels aren’t the problem, the way we’ve been conditioned to understand gender and sexuality and their labels through the compulsory cisheteronormative lens we’ve been forced to look at the world through is the problem. And it’s carried over as residual in some of the ways people label themselves in the community today. This isn’t a new problem either though, but it’s just more abundant with more recognition, more language, and technology to spread it.
not much to tell. i've been on social media for over 20 years, and started seeing this delineation between amab/afab on people's profiles on Tumblr about 10 years ago. couldn't tell you why people were doing it, b/c i don't communicate with persons who embrace any part of the binary, but i just remember seeing it. it felt really weird at first seeing it, then uncomfortable. at first i figured it just wasn't for me. but then i started seeing people's warnings on Tumblr about the terf-like communication that came from some blogs with amab/afab and from some LGBTQIA+ spaces and that we should watch out.
LOL, I'm not AFAB either. Assumptions like that are a big reason why I feel the need to clarify that I'm a *transfeminine* genderqueer (or genderqueer transfem, play with your food, play with your words).

Somehow, pointing out the awfulness of the linked post has turned into a big ask that nonbinary people *police ourselves* when it comes to language that clearly and succinctly describes the kinds of prejudice we deal with on a daily basis. EDIT: Or language that we find empowering, especially as an act of resistance to the TERF narrative that nonbinary people are cannibalizing lesbian butch and gay femme culture. 

And honestly, I find AGAB language clunky as heck. But the specific word isn't the issue, it's the idea that the ""purpose"" of nonbinary *doesn't include* radical gender fairy support group aunties like myself.
That last question is Big Fucking Mood! 🙌
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Sorry, I'm bad at focusing on big texts. xD
I suppose, but separating trans boys from cis boys and separating trans girls from cis girls reminds me of the racial segregation of the 20th century.

Otherwise, a separate session for non-binary people seems great! :3
I can't, those are kinda the terms that everybody knows and uses.

A transfem space would specifically be for MtF people, whilst a transmasc space would specifically be for FtM people.
My assigned gender has not had the impact on me as an intersex GQ that you think it has on everyone. And I don't see what being read as a cis woman has to do with being assigned anything -- anyone of any birth assignment can be read and treated like a cis woman OR NOT! Cis women of color are so often exposed to transmisogynoir because black women are seen as inherently more ""manly"" than  white women and excluded from womanhood. Like, the suffragettes actively excluded black women from their definition of woman. So like. Assigned gender really isn't what you think it is, and we dont have to live in a ""magical genderless society"" for that to be the case. Im intersex and post-op salmacian, my assigned gender counts for fuckall medically or socially. I was raised as a genderless kid till i was 9, then reassigned female till I was 16, and then I was raised as male till I was 18 and left home. What part of my assigned gender tells you about that experience?

You might feel like it has some huge impact in your life, but extrapolating that to mean it must be that way for everyone is not gonna work.
Because for us (I’m intersex myself), the gender we were assigned is often traumatic and not congruent with our actual biology. I’ll try to explain using my own experiences. 

I was forcibly operated on the day I was born, my body was altered without mine or my parents consent, and I was raised as female/a girl for half of my life until the changes in my body could no longer be denied. I don’t have experiences “as a female”, I have experiences as a traumatized intersex kid who was forced into a false binary that did nothing but cause problems and confusion for most of my life and set me back by about 20 years in both healthcare and self discovery. My assigned gender at birth was not and is not correct nor applicable to my experiences, and insisting that it is because of how I was “socialized” is really just another weird and frankly transphobic statement if you really start to deconstruct that too.
You don’t need to preach at me, because while to *you* we’re just a research project, this is my actual **LIFE**. I don’t need to *imagine* anything when it comes to being intersex, and you can’t invalidate my experiences as an actual intersex human being living with this condition and in this demographic just to validate your own feelings and opinions.

Uh...I'm asking what it is, I don't know what it means. :(

I don't quite understand what a ""male socialized experience"" and vice versa is.
I think the extent to which people identify as having had a typical AGAB experience in that realm varies. 

I’m intersex and the way I was hurt was a bit different than the typical stuff people say when they talk about AFAB vs AMAB nonbinary people. I was coercively assigned a gender. We all were to some extent, but even if people would still assume an AGAB of me it’s very complicated.

The strict lines people draw like that while assuming shared experience (that all AFAB people experience x socialization/experience for example) just because of AGAB contributes to cultural erasure, intersexism, and assumption that whiteness (how many predominately LGBT+ spaces like this one even know what Ungendering means?) and other elements don’t affect AGAB experiences.

The generalizations go haywire when people start bringing up AGAB. It’s not as simple as even many nonbinary people think. 

Many of us still need to work on taking apart the gender binary in our heads and the biological essentialism and (assumed white, assumed culturally christian, assumed euroamerican) socialization assumptions there. Socioeconomic status even affects this. 

An [appalachian kid](https://www.jstor.org/stable/41446780) is gonna have a different gender socialization (and [sexuality socialization](https://www.ohioswallow.com/book/Loving+Mountains%2C+Loving+Men)!) experience than even other kids in the US in like, neighboring Maryland. **Not enough consideration for details that affect socialization are often taken into account casually to ever be truly accurate beyond assumption, unfortunately.** It’s so much more complicated than a “universal AGAB experience.” It’s *assumed* straight forward by AGAB. I could even cite [other](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1ppst1) [gender](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520271487/dude-youre-a-fag) [theory](https://www.jstor.org/stable/464747) and sociology books and studies on this. 

Important: Trying to be genuine, not guilt trippy here. If you don’t know or see these assumptions in yourself it’s natural to society. But, it’s unhealthy and makes it harder to actually get past gender essentialism. These assumptions have even been acknowledged to have [affected medical studies in a negative way.](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674725324) The assumptions run deep deep deep.

Edited so there’s not huge paragraphs that are harder to look at.

Edit 2: i have a bunch of academic citations in this post. if anyone wants resources or more citations for my points, feel free to dm me. i would love talking to anyone that has questions, though i’m not a theory of anything professor so some things will be more difficult for me to answer and we’ll have to look for books on it
I could never date someone who isn’t bi/pan because I’ll constantly feel like “oh you’re the exception” or that they think of me as the gender they’re primarily attracted to.
I get that but I usually bring out the training wheels when I’m talking about gender with cis people 🤣 yanno what I mean? I totally agree with your point here, the biggest offense here is their assumption that your AGAB affects your gender/presentation in a humongous way according to being AFAB/AMAB. That’s just the gender binary with extra steps. 🤣
I’m gonna push back because you’re misunderstanding what I’m saying. The existence of the nonbinary label is what allowed me to understand myself, and that’s just a fact.

Without that label, I’d be trying to find the words to describe myself. Id be struggling to find a community. I’d be feeling alone and confused and isolated. And all those feelings would manifest in anxiety or depression or some other form of distress which would prevent me from having the mental space to explore my existence deeper than base survival levels. It’s because of the label that I was able to find others who identify with the label and talk to them and learn their experiences and thus understand my own better. It’s because of the label that I had support and felt calm enough to dive into my own identity and truly see myself for who I am. And while the label doesn’t define me, it was very much needed for me to understand myself. And having lived for multiple decades before finding the label despite knowing for myself exactly who I am (and feeling generally okay saying I didn’t need a label to know for myself), I can assure you that having the label still made a world of difference in me understanding my own identity.

As much as people want to act like labels aren’t necessary, they are necessary for communicating ideas to each other. It’s language. It’s how humans share thoughts.

I get what you’re saying, too, but I feel like you’re discounting the very real benefits of labels when used properly. They are tools, and in the hands of different people, they can be used to heal and help - or harm.
I don’t get what you mean by policing ourselves? Wasn’t the linked post someone applying terminology to us, not us to ourselves? 

I also don’t get what you mean by “the purpose” of nb not including radical gender?? What is radical gender? Wdym by “purpose?”

Intersectionality is definitely big but especially with regards to nb people the waters get murky specifically because we’re not a uniform group of people and we’re very hard to generalise. And it’s just so easy to use specific language when talking about groups. Like, why not just say you’re attracted to fem nb people? All fem nb people are fem… not all AFAB nb people are. Or if you’re talking about reproductive health, why not just say “nb people with [body part]?” Bc if you’re talking about breasts, then there are transfem people with them and transmasc people without them, so AFAB and AMAB don’t work. Some AFAB people have had hysterectomies so you can’t say AFAB people if you’re talking about uteri. Same with AMAB people and testicles. I guess I’m just confused why not be specific when talking abt other people? When it’s yourself Ofc that’s one thing, but otherwise I don’t get it. 

Also, I assumed you were AFAB specifically because of the Leslie bit. (And also honestly because I’ve seen a lot of AFAB nb TERFs say really similar stuff; not saying you’re one at all but my mind kind of unthinkingly linked the two. But that means it’s my mistake, so I’m sorry).
I didn’t really think about it like that but you are right, it’s a bit dodge for them to separate trans and cis binary people like that. I suppose they just wanted to create a safe space where people could feel more comfortable around other non cis people. I hope it gets some adjustments so it’s not so segregated like you say
Okay? I’m saying we’re not going to agree and leaving it at that. I’m well aware of the standard argument.
So basically what you've just told me is that you didn't experience having a boy/girl gender assigned at birth the way 99.something% of people do. That's great for you. And that also influenced how you grew up, and interacted with the world, and developed your identity, and the things you think and believe today.

I am read as a cis woman because I am AFAB and have chosen to forego any medical transition. This is one of the ways that for me, personally, my assigned gender influences my life daily. Is that going to be the case for absolutely every AFAB person? Certainly not. It's just an example.

But EVERY SINGLE PERSON'S assigned at birth gender IS GOING TO INFLUENCE THEIR LIFE in *some kind* of way. And even if it doesn't seem relevant now, it still had an effect on an individual's past, which has a play in shaping their present.

I don't know how I could make this any more clear.
I guess I don’t really understand where the disagreement is

I said this 

> They are also impacted by their personal history - how they were socialized, how they are seen by strangers, their history of how they understand their gender, and their physical body. I don’t think intersex people existing means that any of these things aren’t important it just means some people have more complicated experiences

And then you seemed to give a lot of examples of being impacted by your personal history, by having people view you as a gender you are not, being impacted by your specific biology etc. So I’m a bit confused what you’re objecting too. The fact that intersex people and non intersex people have different experiences is part of the point I’m making ig; that there is a lot more context to our experience of gender than just the identity portion
- I'm not ""preaching at"" you, you came at me with an accusation that I'm not considering intersex people, and I explained that I do.

- I didn't once ask you to imagine anything, that phrase appears where? 

- ....I'm not making any attempt to invalidate your experiences, that doesn't even make any sense.

?

And even I don't know for sure whether I'm intersex or not, I just don't have strong reasons to investigate all aspects of it.
If this can only be GNC, then is the requirement to be non-binary that one has physical dysphoria with your body/hormones? I've read multiple discussions on this forum indicating that this is not the case, and that physical dysphoria is not required to be non-binary.
okay sorry! i’m so used to people picking fights 😬
It just means those things that are common to most people growing up assigned male/female. It will vary a bit by culture, but there are still the overall expectations: for someone seen as a girl, that marriage & kids will be a priority for you, that you’ll be a good caretaker, that it’s valuable for you to be physically attractive. These examples are super super basic; it’s basically the entire way the world views you and treats you based on your perceived gender. Someone’s primary caretakers might be unusual and cause them to have a somewhat different experience, but the rest of the world will still adjust their expectations and perceptions based on which gender they think the baby/child/teen in front of them is. It shapes who you are and how you see the world, and also provides a range of common experiences, which is why it’s often relevant in gender discussions.
> **Not enough consideration for details that affect socialization are often taken into account casually to ever be truly accurate beyond assumption, unfortunately.** It’s so much more complicated than a “universal AGAB experience.” It’s assumed straight forward by AGAB.

I think it's a huge leap to say that talking about AGAB is some universalizing generalization. (It's understandable to making that leap since a lot of people on social media do likewise.) Rather talking about all of our various factors, dimensions of privilege and disadvantage, is a way to be accountable for the uniqueness of our histories. I don't say ""I was raised as a boy, and therefore I can speak for all people who were raised as a boy."" I say, ""I'm a late-transitioning transfeminine and white person from the American midwest, if what I say is *not relevant to you, you don't have to agree.*"" 

In discussing my gender history, I'm inviting discussion of shared and not-shared experiences. But there's no way of making sense of my personal gender history without describing forms of abuse that were tied to growing up masc, white, and queer in the American midwest.
Well that's why I agree. That specific comment was perfect. The statement is we are not a monolith. We are not our AGAB. And even if they are stuck in the binary, we are not obligated to have their lense of seeing things. We should be respected as humans for just being humans, not be focused on out AGAB
So that means people like you would’ve never found those things before the word non-binary existed? Because they did. But I’m not looking to argue. At least you feel like you’ve found community. I have not found labels to do the same for me whatsoever.
> I don’t get what you mean by policing ourselves?  Wasn’t the linked post someone applying terminology to us, not us to ourselves?

Many of the responses have also addressed self-identification. ""Using it as an additional label outside these contexts does totally defeat the purpose of being nonbinary and adds gentials ...""

> What is radical gender? Wdym by “purpose?” 

First of all argument up-thread was that using language that describes our AGAB or gender history ""defeats the purpose of being nonbinary"" (nevermind the essentialist language underlying nonbinary as a state of being). I find it more than a bit rude to jump into a thread and do context erasure. 

Note that this particular argument comes up on a daily basis in this space, not just with AGAB language, but also with sexuality labels, butch/femme and transfem/masc as well. 

""Radical gender fairy"" is a play on the term ""radical fairy."" Radical fairies are a gender-inclusive and gay-centric movement, with a smidge of ""radical queer"" along the way. Both are movements that reject the idea that sexual and gender liberation are entirely separate things. 

My point is I'm not less nonbinary when I reference my gender history or *contextually* use terms like ""fairy"" or ""auntie"" to describe different aspects of my existence. 

> And it’s just so easy to use specific language when talking about groups. 

Some of that specific language is going to reveal aspects of our gender history. I experienced 1. anti-gay discrimination 2. in the 1990s 3. as a member of the Boy Scouts of America 4. in the American midwest. That's four facts about me that help to contextualize my reaction to ""groomer"" language in 2023. 

None of those facts is a claim that my experience *defines* or *represents* anyone else who shares those facts. It's a starting point of discussion. But I can think of no other way to explain why ""groomer"" language is *personally* offensive *to me* without reference how that label affected me as a young adult. 

> Also, I assumed you were AFAB specifically because of the Leslie bit.

Yes, you did.
No, I did have an assigned gender at birth. Your assumption that my experiences mean I didn't is the problem im talking about here.

Being assigned female impacts you in certain ways, sure. But there is no quintessential ""afab experience"" that we can group people by, is what I'm saying. All people assigned any gender will have very different experiences regardless of sharing an AGAB. That's why the idea of ""afab and amab enbies"" having distinctly separate experiences and being two coherent categories is a problem, like what's being talked about by OP. You and I might both be AFAB but we have probably next to nothing in common based on that. So someone being attracted to ""afab NBs"" means literally nothing.
You're absolutely fine to use nonbinary. She's just generally shitty to nonbinary people (and by the looks of things, trans people in general actually). Check her post history and you'll see.
I see, so people who have grown up as a boy would be expected to be tough, to be able to handle pressure, to be able to handle male-on-male bullying, to ""man up"" during sad/negative times, and so on...

I myself was raised as a boy but never quite fit the image, I was bullied harshly for being gentle and liking girl things, I remember one time when I was 8, I was forced to kiss another boy cause ""boys will be boys"", they would chuck rocks at me, they would spit on me and so many other terrible things...

But in your original comment...why did you only mention female-socialization issues and not the male ones too?
I said often earlier on the post, not every instance. I wasn’t going to qualify it every sentence tbh. Also you qualifying your experience as that plus **white & masc & midwest** means you’re inherently **not doing what I was critiquing.** The other aspects that you could talk from and examine would include like, socioeconomic status etc.

I’m critiquing people who are like, “This is an AFAB experience,” and “This is an AMAB experience,” as a binary without admitting other factors contribute to said experience like being white etc.

You speaking for yourself is not a generalization of everyone who is AMAB. I’m talking about people who say, “This is an AFAB experience,” not, “This is _my_ AFAB experience.”
Humans logically know all expiriences are unique, but also know there are huge societal pressures, that vary around the world and family to family, however there are similarities as no person lives in a vacuum of life experience. Such as being queer AFAB that is not intersex, I relate to cisgendered women more than cisgendered men in various aspects of my life, especially when the typical non-lgbtq person probably sees me as women, weird (to them) women, but they still see me that way. So larger society puts different expectations on me than a AMAB person, and then my family puts additional expectations that differ from my AMAB siblings, the place I live in also add variety of expectations (being a more conservative Canadian city). 

I can deny these expectations, and do regularly, but they still exist and affect me. The expectation that I'll wear a dress to my cousins wedding, not every AFAB,  nonbinary, trans or cis, would have this expectation put on them by their family. However, it is still influenced by my AGAB, as an AMAB person would have different expectations put on them. And there will be 'consequences' for denying this expectation, such as relatives being unhappy with me, mybe harrassing me. This is a relatively small consequences so I'll likely deal with them, but if I was AMAB and wore a dress those consequences could be larger, as in being disowned, because in the western world a AFAB dressing masculine is more okay than a AMAB dressing feminine. However in some cultures me being AFAB and dressing masculine can have larger consequences.

 Every person has multiple intersectionalities in their existence that change how things affect them, and AGAB is one of them, being intersex or not is another, race and is a big insectionality. And these intersectionalities highly influence each other. The variety of intersectionalities people experience should be talked about, as it creates better understanding, and AGAB is included in that. It doesn't mean that one is reducing themselves to their AGAB when talking about the experience that involves that, it is just a different way in general of experiencing being nonbinary.
So here you:

-have told me I’m rude for forgetting what the first comment was about because I have a life and was preparing dinner for four people

-seem to be being aggressive because I’m not constantly in online lgbt spaces and don’t know all the relevant terminology and frequently discussed arguments

-keep acting like I’m saying it’s bad to reference your personal ‘gender history’ when I’ve said multiple times now that that’s not an issue at all and that what I’m talking about is when other people group us up in gender essentialist ways

-were very condescending to what was an honest mistake which I genuinely apologised and took responsibility for

This is not a conversation I would like to continue. Have a great rest of your day or night.
Got it, thanks for the heads up!
Because I had a brain glitch and meant to write female/male and didn’t 🤦🏻‍♀️ I edited it now!
I’m talking about assumptions that are so common I could link a reddit comment right now, not saying people can’t talk about themselves. **You saying that personally, your AGAB affected your experience, is not what I’m talking about.**

AMAB and AFAB people do not have the same expectations placed upon them universally. However, people _assume_ all AFAB people to be dyadic when you say AFAB. People _assume_ all AMAB people were socialized to suppress their emotions. A common experience is **not** a universal one. The reason people assume these things is because of transphobia, cissexism, racism, and so on. No one is saying AGAB doesn’t affect people. I’m saying there’s no **universal way** that AGAB affects people.

EDIT: (This gets into semantics which I won’t critique for in others, but personally my stance on how to talk about this is to name the beast. **Why would people call it an AFAB experience when you could just call it misogyny or transphobia?** A _lot of the time_ (not ALL the time) when people talk about it it’s not “an AFAB” thing. It’s misogyny. It’s not “an AMAB thing” it’s transmisogyny or toxic masculinity or whatever. Why not name what you’re experiencing instead of implying all AFAB or AMAB people experience your experience? 

This also clarifies speaking when _say for example,_ a passing trans woman experiences _misogyny_ instead of transmisogyny because people assume she’s a cis woman. That experience would be identical to what many people would call an AFAB experience. Therefore, to me it makes more sense to just say I’ve experienced misogyny.)

People often use arguments as such to imply **all** trans women have a “masculine socialization” (some trans women would say yes, **others would definitely not**) which is transmisogynistic as many women have pointed out. I suggest [Whipping Girl](https://www.sealpress.com/titles/julia-serano/whipping-girl/9781580056229/).

This affects how people talk about things. An intersex AFAB experience is no less an AFAB experience than a dyadic one, but people _assume._ Generalizations like that genuinely only work if you assume a “default” AGAB experience exists. It does not. It’s _erasure_ to call any particular AGAB experience universal.

Your perspective is addressed in my citations that I can tell you clearly did not look at. I’m against **generalizing experiences** to be universal, not speaking from a personal perspective.

Your experience will reflect pressures that YOUR society puts on your AGAB, your family, your class, your geographic location, as example. You cannot separate being AFAB from the other elements of your life and surroundings. The crap you experienced because of the expectations around you were affected by things that are not universal. That experience won’t be the same for me and you and others. That’s the point. 

EDIT: BTW I’m from a rural rural town in southern Appalachia. The closest place that does HRT is hundreds of dollars of gas away. I’ve experienced severe oppression on all of my own cross-sections. I’m **not** just speaking out of my ass just academically here when it comes to these things as someone who’s never experienced anything. I’ve experienced severe misogyny and transphobia and intersexism and exorsexism and so on. I don’t pretend _how_ I experienced those things are universal.

AGAB is most useful when discussing medical procedures… And even then you _have_ to specify if someone is proceeding with medical stuff like HRT. Do you know why this is important?

AGAB _usually_ decides how much adrenaline is put into your heart. **This is flat out dangerous.** The amounts of epinephrine do not change depending on size, it’s very dependent on how much estrogen/testosterone/progesterone and so on is in your system. If you are on HRT and now predominately use E, if they give you the “AMAB” dose of adrenaline it could do some damage. Likewise, if you take T and you get the “AFAB” dose it might not be enough. **Medical science didn’t account for that because they ASSUME AMAB and AFAB is much more clearly defined than it is.**

This is also why as an intersex person sometimes medications don’t work as expected on me. The assumptions flat out contribute to death, lmfao
I apologize, this has been a rough conversation and I need to step away and join a trans gaming group. Thank you for your apology and I wish you well.
>Why would people call it an AFAB experience when you could just call it misogyny or transphobia?

Maybe it's because I tend to look at speech acts rather than semantics, but I don't see what the difference *in effect* is between describing CAGAB and ""naming the beast."" Saying ""I'm CAMAB"" and ""I was a gay Eagle Scout"" both reveal the gender that was assigned to me in my teen years. The same is true if I talk about relationship abuse from that period, or how internalized homo/biphobia influenced multiple life choices. 

It was *my* assumed-male experience because I was living as an assumed-male person at the time (dropping ""at birth"" because that might be a hangup), and systems and institutions involved acted differently towards assumed-male and assumed-female persons. How do I ""name the beast"" of historical institutional discrimination and bias against LGBTQIA people without describing both those policies and my relationship to them? Which in turn, invites assumptions about my CAGAB?

And there's cases where the name, shape, and hair color of the beast is not anyone's business, invasive, and potentially retraumatizing. I reserve the right to be vague about sexual assaults I experienced living as an assumed-male person and will refer you to the body of research, journalism, and cultural studies regarding assumed-male survivors and rape denial. 

So honestly, it looks to me you are splitting hairs between two linguistic forms that are used the same way, say a lot of the same things about personal history, and not being used in the ways you are criticizing. I think there's more essentialism being brought into this discussion with the noun form of ""enby"" than there is with CAGAB.
I literally said in that comment _the sentence **before and after** what you quoted_ that I don’t get on people for verbiage.

Here is the full context, bolding new for emphasis, italics the part you took:

> EDIT: (**This gets into semantics which I won’t critique for in others, but personally my stance on how to talk about this is to name the beast.** *Why would people call it an AFAB experience when you could just call it misogyny or transphobia?* A lot of the time **(not ALL the time)** when people talk about it it’s not “an AFAB” thing.

**What I do personally is not me thinking other people are stupid or wrong.** Your example is incompatible and not equivalent to the example I made. In conversation I try to assume people have a reason for things, but nuance is hard to come by. 

I’m not sure how to be more clear than I already am. The way you chose to take the comment out of a sandwich of disclaimers on either end is not ideal to having a conversation that’s genuine.

I also explicitly said [in response to your comment that you talking about that stuff is **not** doing what I’m critiquing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/122imf4/im_sick_of_people_narrowing_down_nonbinary_people/jdsu7vs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)"	122imf4	NonBinary	1287	0.99	2023-03-26 10:56:18

If you have an LGBTQ friendly university, the office of the ombuds may be able to help. Not sure about where you go, but where I went to school they were heavily invested in advocating for students. I can see that the instructor was attempting inclusivity by saying it’s your “gender identity” rather than just saying “sex” or “gender”, but this feels rather hamfisted and I question the necessity of bringing gender into the equation at all—splitting groups based on name + birth month would have worked just as well without making anyone uncomfortable.
Damn sucks to be a man or a woman, they have to do thesis assignments!
It's not only gendered, it's heteronormative. You can either try to discuss your point with the teacher or you can choose a sex that's not the one assigned to you at birth and encourage everyone in your class to do the same. The point of the assignment is being able to argue what love is or what is not with supportive statements and everyone should be able to do that.
I once (2009 or so) had a college interviewer ask me (then female-presenting) what a Disney Princess I would be and I said Mulan and asked if she also asked the boys the same thing. She said she asked them what superhero they would be. I said Nightcrawler and crossed that school right off my list.
""According to your own gender identity"" and then proceeds to be weirdly heteronormative. Lol
I don't for one minute condone it, but I wonder if the creator of the assignment believed there would be better empathy if females wrote about the challenge from a female point of view and likewise for males 

It's incredibly outdated and non-inclusive to do something like this ☹️
Pretty sure this is straight up a Title IX violation even if you ignore the existence of trans people
I could see where the instructor was coming from if and only if they were instructing the men in the class specifically to empathize with and write from the perspective of the narrator, who is a woman. It's incredibly easy and reductive to tell the men in the class to find reasons to argue that the narrator's husband is actually doing what's best, or that there's a literal supernatural explanation. This is just a poorly-designed assignment all around, and forcing a gender divide is the icing on the cake. If you're gojng to enforce a gender binary in the reading of a text (which you shouldn't) it ought to at least be with the goal of teaching people to interrogate the text from a different perspective than what their unconscious bias might direct them towards.
That is the most bizzare assignment i’ve ever seen…
As a college professor, what — and I cannot stress this enough — the fuck
Guess that means you get a freebie for the assignment?

In all seriousness, that's absolutely not cool. At a minimum they should apologize, let you pick which one you're completing, and change the assignment for the future.
What a weird way to assign things out anyways? Just let students pick one of the four! Plus it seems super sexist hoe those prompts are split regardless
This is so stupid. Why not just split the class into 4 groups and give each group a thesis statement? What's the point of dividing people by gender and birthdays????
Low key the way they split it up is kinda sexist too because why do the girls have to write about oppression but the boys don’t
Why TF not split it up into 4 different birth dates instead of gender?
Can you email your professor and ask them if you can do the assignment differently? Like having the option to choose any question you want to work on.
There are better ways to divide the class into four parts.
I’m a college professor (15 years in) and this honestly the dumbest structure I’ve ever seen for an assignment this prof needs to take a fucking workshop on Transparent Instructional Design and Assessment like fucking asap 

Also this probably why I never talk to any of my colleagues lollllll
I love literature. I love analysis and criticism and interpretation. If I got this assignment, I would tell the teacher to shove it up their ass. It being gendered is absolutely horrible, no doubt, but it's also a terrible assignment because it forces interpretations of the story, some intentionally wrong, into students that may be unsure what to take from it. It's like making someone write a paper about how the mob in Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" were correct to do that they did; it entirely goes against the point of the story.




And yeah, because I was AMAB and don't try to not look masculine, the teacher would expect me to do one of the ""male"" topics, which I wouldn't be able to do because I have a functional brain and know that those interpretations are bullshit. I get trying to teach critical thinking and seeing other perspectives, but would anyone try to get students to argue FOR the men in A Handmaid's Tale?



I'm sure the teacher thinks they're being inclusive by saying ""according to your gender identity,"" but they clearly don't understand that much about different identities. Or the point of the story. Good luck, OP. This class might be tough.
What class is this? Being assigned a thesis statement at all is weird to me, even if the point is to make you look at the writing in a specific way. Your teacher's writing is also... rough. 

The unnecessary gendering is definitely a rotten cherry on top, I'm sorry you're dealing with this and hope you can safely navigate the situation and conversation with the teach! There are many other ways to make four groups, I'd just split into groups of three months each, irrespective of gender(/sex, which the specific wording they used seems to indicate and kinda icks me).

Edit: Just realized they did say 'gender identity,' so B for effort haha! It was the Male/Female wording that triggered my last response.
Oh boy, I feel this. I'm taking a language class and while practicing a conversation as a class, my professor was like ""women read for Mary and men read for Takeshi"" and I was just frozen 😂😭
I guess that means I dont have to do the assignment. There’s no thesis on here for me.
Assign everyone you perceive as boys the role of defending the patriarchy, gaslighting the protagonist, and making up some ghost stories to avoid respecting a woman.  Yeah, great idea, fearless leader 🫡 And should the boys also write a list of punishments they'll use when assaulting their wives some day? Only when the females try to escape, of course!

What a shit professor.  What's the lesson here??

""Symbolism is when everyone's wacky ideas are equal, no matter how sexist, and stories like the Yellow Wallpaper are full of 10-12 clues about why feminists are wrong and Steven King's Rose Red was the real oppressor the whole time!"" 🤡
...even outside nonbinarism I'd be asking professor why the prompts are gender segregated.

Also, in general, assigning theses is bad teachering. Should be grounds for professional repremanding.
Honestly I would look at your university's policy on lgbt issues and consider reporting it if you bring it up with the professor and they don't change it/even acknowledge it. (Or just report them upfront if you're uncomfortable talking directly to them about it, which is what I would probably do. Definitely the option that will make you look like more of the ""bad guy"" possibly but hey.)
If they wanted four thesis choices why didn’t they just split it in groups of three months?
Alright. Alternative selection.. no matter which gender. If you were born in January-June you can choose from either: 

>John is not genuinely interested in helping his wife get well; he truly loves and cares for her, and thinks he is doing what's is best for her, against better judgement.

>The yellow wallpaper represents the oppression the narrator is under from her husband--the space they live in is, in fact, sinister with a bad history, and the narrative is in danger of the male-dominated world in which she lives.

And if you were born in july-december

>John truly loves and cares for her. His intention is to control every aspect of his wife's existence in order to maintain his own position of power under the belief that he is trying his best to help his wife get well.

>The house and the room represents sinister spaces with baf histories, the narrator I'd under oppression from her her husband who had been possesses with the male-dominated world in which he lives. They are both in danger from metaphorical figures outside and behind the wallpaper which possessed the husband psychologically.

Really mess with them and then when they ask, say ""well i don't fit into the ""male"" or ""female"" category specifically so I made the prompts reflect my gender identity by mish-mashing them."" And then send along the other three prompts for their use on future assignments and say ""you're welcome.
Oh lucky you! You don't have a paper to write :)
This screams title 9 violation
Okay wtf “according to your GENDER IDENTITY” and then goes to list FEMALES and MALES. 
Do they even know how language works? 
I have had forms to fill that ask for my sex and it kind of irks me but at least they ask for my SEX.
Yikes. It's not just about the gender options here, it's also which genders have been assigned which viewpoints
Email time!

Hello, professor. Seeing as I don’t fit into any of the given categories, it is evident to me that you must want to give me an automatic A for this assignment. I appreciate this generous offer and accept. Unless the language on the given assignment document changes, you will not be receiving an assignment from me, as I will be accepting the A. Thank you very much. 

That’s what I would do ngl
welp i guess you don’t have an assignment to do 🤷 if they’re assigning based on binary genders they’ve assigned you nothing 😎
You should directly ask the prof (via email) what you should do.

Always via email, always get it in writing
That sucks, friend. I am in school right now and I’ve just started politely emailing the professor and asking what nonbinary students should do when stuff like this comes up. I usually get an overly apologetic response and an updated assignment. I live in a liberal area though, so YMMV.
Ewww this is so cis- and hetero-normative. Wtf
Welp, I'm neither male or female. Guess I get to skip this assignment.
That is dumb, also if they wanted to break it into quarters they could go off of birth seasons, or random lots, or literally anything else
Why the fuck are they referring to, on paper students as males and females anyways??
Ew. Why Tf is this necessary. NGL I would refuse to do it and talk to the dean about it but that’s me.
Legit, my lifelong indignation with bullshit like this should have been a very early sign that I was non-binary.
I don’t like how this is laid out. The females have to pick one side (that homie isn’t at all interested in helping his wife, and being toxic for lack of better words, and the males are to pick the other in which he’s the “good guy” and actively loves and wants to help. I just don’t like that, and it gives me ick vibes. 
Also, if you’re ballsy enough, I’d tell the teacher my gender identity is none, but I’m also very sassy and petty. But honestly, I’d have a conversation with them at least, because that’s not entirely fair for you to be forced to pick one.
i guess that means you don't have to do work then
They could have just done the first letter of first and last names and gotten the same number of options.
That's unfortunate
Be cheeky and write from the perspective of someone (or something) else but follow the required points to the assignment for both the gender options.

Write from the perspective of a house plant or something explaining the issues objectively. Sometimes professors appreciate creativity in their assignments. And you can use that to say “hey my gender wasn’t included so I fixed it for you.”
This seems to be intentional transphobia from my perspective. It instructed students to do the assignment based on their “gender identity” but then immediately referred to terms easily recognizable with biological *sex*. What class is this for??
Not only that, they're telling girls to take the perspective that the man is manipulative and telling the guys to argue that he's good intentioned... breeding attitudes of suspecting others and being self righteous rather than trying to understand how other people may have good intentions or how we might be in the wrong... idk just feels a bit off to me.
Say fucking what... That assignment is COMPLETELY fucked up.
FUCKING BULLSHIT. Also I vote since they gendered it on husband vs wife that nonbinarys are now the strange wallpaper that is driving the wife mad.
So your comments show it’s Comp 2, and for writing for “the humanities”…

Choose a section, (I’d personally choose the “sinister spaces” avoid sex/gendered issues)

Write your chosen thesis statement at the top..

Then explain why you chose this thesis statement (in my mentioned choice it would be because it’s the only non gender based viewpoint)

Then do the assignment.

Also….wait to turn in till last minute, see if you can get a response that actually helps you fulfill the assignment.

And a final bit of fun, here’s a story…comp two…had to write about my “weekend waste”…mainly food and trash based…

So I made a roast chicken for Friday, chicken soup Saturday, and ate leftovers Sunday….a few bits of plastic bagging for the chicken and veggies, and some degradable trash…that was my paper…

I got “talked to” by that teacher because “most people can’t eat that little”…I was on food stamps at the time, and I never eat much because of swallowing issues….I just shrugged and said “I did the assignment”….I got a passing grade on it…

Write a decent paper, that YOU can feel proud of, AND that feels like it fulfills the teacher’s expectations….if you get singled out for it go to the administration and file an issue.
Sounds like you gets to choose whichever argument you prefer 😎 and if the teacher gets angry see who can make a bigger deal out this obviously sexist/transphobic assignment.
You could try reaching out to the EDI department.
They could probably do something about it , or maybe emailing the teacher? Good luck!
This giving me huge “She uses they/them pronouns” vibes. They tried to sound inclusive, but then missed the mark completely.
Not only is this ew but I read the prompts and they specifically gave only ""female"" students the ones that go deeper into the underlying message of gender roles and oppression and they gave the ""male"" students the ""everything the dude does is justified even though he treats her like a child because he *loves* her"" and ""it's not her husband's neglect and oppressive behavior that made her lose herself, it's the evil house even though the house was very clearly a metaphor"" bullshit readings. Not only it it cisnormative and forcibly reinforces binary thinking, but it specifically reinforces sexism by intentionally discouraging young men from thinking about sexism and it's effects and different ways of showing. All round gross.
It also looks sexist AF.  Women have to write about resenting their husbands and men have to write about their experience as Doctors?  What the fuck?
I hate that story so them adding some weird binary and hetero rules to the thesis is some double level bs
lmao, no instructions for enby folks means no work for them

sit back and chillax lmao
Tell the professor that the instructions were unclear, so you burned it
Flex on the professor by writing two papers. (not a serious suggestion because holy crap)
I guess you don't have to do the assignment! 😬
Guess you don't have to do it then :D
This is actually disgusting in general wtf
Boooooo!
I FUCKING FEEL THAT! I know it’s not necessarily the same… but every damn job app I’ve put in only provides male or female.. like it’s 2023… GET WITH IT
The horses name was Friday
🤢
powermove: dont do it
*FEEEEEEMALES*

That's something to report, yes?
yikes. I'm sure they could've just split the birth month into 1/4ths or just assigned them randomly.
Looks like you don't have to do the assignment then
Do the opposite of your agab to spite the professor
You don't need to do the assignment ig
Dude I HATE IT when when things are pointlessly gendered. Like seriously. Something else that pisses me off is boys versus girls. Or anything that differentiates girls from boys. I mean, there’s a small difference but nothing much, and there’s no point in changing things due to gender. Especially when you’re nonbinary or something else. Like what tf am I supposed to do? Split myself between the two groups??
There is also a bad rapresentation of men. All in one basically ahah
Just pick whichever you like best I guess. But I hate shit like that, just let people choose their own thesis instead of ""oh btw you were born a month premature from July? Fuck you, male post-July is your assignment""
How is this legal?
That's a really weird way to assign school work
Noooo :(
this professor sounds sexist or something.
This seems so needless why not split it up based on birthday and split the year into quarters
Non-binary people don’t have to complete this assignment.
YIIIIIKES. I’m a college prof and this would never occur to me. Why doesn’t the prof just split it ALL by birthday? Or by last name? 

If you have the spoons for it, consider giving this to your school’s EO (Equal Opportunity) officer. LMK if I can help you figure out who that is or what to say or anything.
If you have the time, you could do all of them just to prove a point to your teacher/prof and then end the assignment with an explanation that not every person identifies as male or female. I’m such a try hard though, I know that solution might not work for everyone
Well that's obnoxiously unnecessary and intrusive.
Looks to me like you’re excused from the assignment. Automatic pass.
this made me remember why i dropped out of school 😅
OOF. If they weren't gonna add more than male or female, they should have done it by sex assigned at birth. Whatadumbass teacher.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I guess you’ll have to do them all lol
In addition to the shitty gender stuff, assigning someone a specific topic to write about is how you get way more students to hate academic writing. I’ve always found that picking a topic I was genuinely interested in to be the best. Seems to be a bad teacher all the way around.
It would take a while, but do both and turn them in and if the teacher asks why there are two just say a random word or nothing.
Ewww this is such garbage.
Say you can not do the assignment because you're neither.
Guess that means you can get both the male and female option then
Is this like when someone finds an item without a price tag and says “I guess it’s free!” You just get to skip this assignment, I guess.
Looks stupid anyway!!
Every time I have to pick male or female on some form, I just sigh and pick the closest thing to what I’m feeling that day. But being forced into a gender based on someone else’s expectations would really piss me off. Sorry you have to deal with that OP.
This shouldn't be allowed. Is there someone you can report this to?
Yikes
This makes me sick…
🤮🤮
is it only me who understands why its okay to do this and also why its not okay.
Ew
wtf they do this in college too? middle school shit fr
Fight the power
What was the reason? I mean... just WHY?
That is such a bizarre way to assign prompts to someone. Assuming you’re in the US, is this a community college? It looks like something an adjunct would do.
Just ask where is my assignment
If that were my class, at this point honestly I'd just pick a completely different angle / lense through which to analyse it, and go absolutely ham on making it legit and meaningful. Come up with something that fills the assessment criteria that isn't either of the shitty binary options lol. I did this a few times for my creative writing degree, naturally not all of my teachers liked that whatsoever (and admittedly I failed one class because of it lol but that dude was an asshat). But some of them thought it was snarky but well done 😆 and I got great marks

However as someone else mentioned it's awful that the split is such that some of the ""males"" (ugh) are literally arguing pro abuser stance but ok. The person who designed this assessment sounds like they would literally be the last person to give a fuck about this ...

Edit: yikes I just noticed too it says ""According to your gender ***identity*** ..."" and then completely leaves out other identities lmao ok
Yay, I have no thesis 🥳
I would politely point it out to your professor and explain to them how it made you feel. They may just be unaware, which is not an excuse. However, it provides a great opportunity to make them understand.
I'm guessing the plan is to pair up people who were assigned contrasting theses.  But you could also do this randomly or by last name or even by birth month alone.
Or hell just organize it by the four seasons of which you were born, much easier to work with
There are 1000x more sensible ways to divide the class into 4 groups. I’d be disappointed but not surprised to see this in elementary school but college???? Also deeply weird how it’s set up so that the men and women get different assignments- and how the “female” prompts both are about how it’s a feminist text while the “male” prompt is how the doctor/husband are in the right or the house is to blame(?). Idk the vibes are off
You know I thought about this too and almost said ""they should have it swapped"" and then I decided it actually wouldn't be better to make female students defend John's medical abuse and decided that actually. It's a terrible prompt either way.
I immediately thought this too, it seems geared towards reinforcing any biases students are already likely to approach the text with. Just a poor way of assigning topics all around.
I don't think any of the theses are particularly anti-feminist (and I actually think the fourth one takes the narrator the most seriously, accepting her experience at its face value), but I do agree shoving all the analysis of symbolism for oppression onto the women in the class is bizarre and... shitty, for lack of a better word. 

The ""male"" topics are also a lot more superficial, analytically. I hope it's just a case of thoughtlessness or legitimate ignorance, but they kind of get off much easier.
Yup, i'd go higher up!
My thought, too. I got such a weird feeling when the first statement for males was in defence of a man that is supposedly supposed to be dangerous or toxic. My only guess as to why it was divided that way was to make sure all of the statements were used?? It’s still way over complicated. 

OP, do none of them lol. Or flex on them and do one from ‘female’ and one from ‘male’
If there's not an ombudsman office, Student Life should also be able to help mediate issues between students and the academic side of the institution
Reach out to the EDI department of the school. They are usually helpful. I work in higher ed and when going through the university website looking for something, I found very gendered suggestions for students on how to dress for an interview. I sent it over to the EDI department of the university and it was fixed pretty quickly.

ETA: Your university should have an EDI department as most accreditation boards are now requiring the university and the individual colleges and/or schools to have an EDI department. They are pretty much required now no matter what.
More genuinely, I'm finding it hard to believe that the way this assignment is structured is doing a good job of teaching about the book. 

If this book is meant to have multiple interpretations, to me, that can suggest that the subversive material is being obscured, at least in part, intentionally to give plausible doubt to the people who the work can influence, so that they may defend it from the people who would suppress it. To put it bluntly, those people don't exist anymore. It seems.. crude? Ineffective? To separate modern students by gender in an attempt to recreate divisions that were naturally formed in the unique cultural climate that this book was written in, doesn't seem like a good basis to analyze how a contemporary man or woman would have read this book.

Why not explicitly structure the assignment to say ""I want this section of students to find evidence to support X argument. Given that evidence, I want you to research the cultural climate of the section of society that gave way to this interpretation on the book, contemporary men and women, and analyze how their life experiences might have influenced them to take X argument."" Any modern student, regardless of gender, could complete every one of those prompts in this hypothetical structure. I'd take it up with a gender studies professor, in or out your institution, and see what they think.
I giggled. 😆

It's like the thought that non-binary people aren't bound by laws in some countries because the wording is always ""he/she"" ... 🤭
Yeah I emailed my teacher about the possibility of me getting a non gendered option for a thesis so I will see what happens \_o_/
Perfect.
And why would they assume they'd all want to be a superhero?? Are supervillains not cooler?
Brilliant responses from you tbh 👏🏻
Even if it was a matter of empathy it should've been the opposite: let men do the anti-patriarchy and the female POV thesis, and the women the male POV. (I agree with you, I just double disagree with the professor)
Oh it definitely is.
title IX?
Legit. Given that it's significantly less challenging for the average cis man to lean into the whole toxic-masculinity-abuse-bias lense as opposed to literally anything else kinda makes it seem like this assessment was designed to academically favour at least that 25% of the class tbh
I like your thinking. I was like: Time to work twice as much as the other students ^^. I guess it depends how OP sees their gender
I get a feeling this teacher wouldn’t have made this gendered unless they wanted someone to challenge them on it, but maybe they just weren’t thinking.
Putting an additional mental burden on the ""females"" who now have to confront their own experiences with oppression to support the thesis, while the ""males"" aren't required to do any extra work addressing internalized experiences with gender.
For real. Like the year is very nicely divisible by 4 ffs...
I did email my professor about doing a different thesis, but they are out of office for a few weeks right now so I don’t know if I will get a response
By months, for example lmao... JAn-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec.... I mean this is not rocket science.
> it forces interpretations of the story, some intentionally wrong, into students that __may be unsure what to take from it__

This is *such* an important point.

The students are not doing this assignment for giggles; they're doing it because it's part of the *learning.* What are they *learning* from this assessment?

When a person is actively taking instruction for a skill they do not yet possess, they are very easily *positioned* based on the instructor's actions, expectations, and biases. This is especially true in a high-pressure institution like a school where students have to learn *right* and learn *fast* or else they fail – which can have lifelong financial, social, and/or career consequences for some, on top of the regular emotional & social trauma – so they're more likely to hit the ground running with whatever they can grasp and hope that'll be enough.

It's one thing when you're heavily experienced in critical analysis, as you fundamentally understand that there are multiple different conclusions to reach and all of them have unique merit that is separate to one's own personal opinions and biases. But when you're literally still learning how to analyse and write about a piece critically, a polarising assessment like this is more likely to *position* students to accept a singular interpretation as ""correct"" and learn interpretation bias going forward ... *especially* given how polarising abusive men vs. silenced women is as a political topic and how traumatic the class is going to be after this. I hope there is *zero* in-class comparison of perspective because it's going to end up with the men insisting they're right and the women being (re-)traumatised tbqh

That was a bit of a rant sorry lol

I miss when the point of studying was to actually *learn,* rather than to rush through hoops at breakneck speeds to prove you're slightly less incapable of doing a shitty entry level job than the next schmuck with the hope that one day you'll be able to buy food without doing a job that makes you want to die inside
I saw you already emailed the professor, OP, but if they're willing to take any specific suggestions, I'd recommend allowing students to form their own theses based off a choice of leading question. 

For example: 

Please choose one of the following questions to answer as the thesis of your paper. There is no wrong answer to these questions; feel free to go with whichever fits your own opinion, or the opposite of what you believe for a challenge!

Does John (the narrator's husband) care for the narrator and legitimately try to help her, or does he have no intention of helping and is only exerting and expanding his control over her life? Please provide and analyze 10-12 pieces of evidence to support your thesis.

Are the figures that the narrator witnesses outside and within the wallpaper purely symbolic (if so, what are they symbols for?), or are they real entities that she ultimately finds herself possessed by? Please provide and analyze 10-12 pieces of evidence to support your thesis.
The class is composition two, we are learning how the write for the humanities.
Depending on genderfluxity I'd either read none or both 😆
Lol if I was braver
Title 9?
I have had to fill out such forms, and as an intersex person, binary forms get old fast.
If I were in school now, I'd absolutely be doing this. I didn't know I was non-binary at the time I went through uni but I had a few of these and it is very clear to me these days why I hated them ... lol egg moments

(also nice username 🥚🐺)
It's completely fucked up.
It’s for comp II
I agree with your point.
Genius lmao
Ya at my job I left it blank lol
Thanks, I need this
May not be, especially considering the gendered nature of the different writing prompts.
I was going to try and get into contact with someone at the school, but my mom (who I live with) got mad at me.  She said I haven’t given the professor enough time to fix it herself. I emailed her yesterday morning, but haven’t gotten a response. Wich I was expecting because she is currently on sick leave, and will be out for another week. We are supposed to finish this wile she is gone.
The instructions specify ""gender identity"" in the instructions, but then lists sexes under the prompts. From what was written, I don't think we can assume that this professor knows how to distinguish between sex and gender. The content of the assignment is about gender and it's repercussions, so I think it would be giving this prof way too much faith to say that splitting a group of people based on sex for a gendered topic wasn't meant to conflate the two.
I'm interested in hearing what might possibly make this okay
Oklahoma
I’m sure it’s just a coincidence the men were all asked to identify with the abusive husband and construct arguments in his favor!
Last name, birth month, favorite color, astrology sign, draw a slip of paper, roll a dice, literally so many different ways they could have chosen to do!
Gender is a terrible thing to pick for this considering it's rarely a 50/50 split when it comes to college classes. Most classes lean heavily toward one or the other. Biochemistry and ochem were the only classes I took where the split was about even.
I don't think academics should make you argue only for points you agree with, but instead teach you the different ways one may interpret any piece of media, so I don't think having both sensible and completely insensitive interpretations of a story as an assignment is bad in and of itself. But then going ahead and assigning these interpretations based on gendered viewpoints so that everyone gets the one they are more likely to agree with is just dumb.
But isn’t this about The Yellow Wallpaper story? A story in which a man imprisons his wife within a yellow bland room because of ‘hysteria’ until she actually goes crazy and starts hearing voices? In the end she has a full mental break. 

Having the guys write a thesis about how a man has the right to imprison his mental distressed wife seems very anti-feminist.
I would argue that it's very much anti-feminist to ignore the overt commentary on gender that The Yellow Wallpaper is making and instead read it as a literal haunting. That reading strips away all of the context of the story, which is rooted in Charlotte Perkins Gilman's experience being treated much the same as the narrator was (which did not, to my knowledge, involve ghosts) and finding it utterly soul-crushing. Ignoring the gendered aspects misinterprets and defangs a very pointed feminist piece.

And IMO the other thesis given for men is even worse- the closest you can get to a non-awful interpretation is that John means well even as he's hurting her, but that's still abuse apologia, because it's focusing on the allegedly good intentions of an abuser instead of the harm their actions cause. This is especially offensive considering that it's excusing away the trauma the author actually experienced.

Also tone doesn't always come through well in text, so I just wanna say that I'm not trying to rip you a new one or say you're an antifeminist or anything like that. I'm upset with the shitty assignment and the awful theses it gives, not with you.
There were certainly contemporary women who took the side that the woman was being genuinely cared for. It's hard to notice water when you're a fish. There were certainly contemporary men who took the side that the woman was being oppressed. Men might be collectively motivated to maintain their privileges, but it's always up to the individual whether or not to take it. 

What benefit would the modern student take from taking the book out of it's historical context and substituting an echo of the modern student's position within gendered society, across an artificial line that wasn't held the reception that this book was originally received in?
Please update!
Go the chaotic route: Your thesis is about how the husband and society are trying to force the wife into a heteronormative life in which she feels her role as ""wife"" and gender as ""female"" does not align with who she actually is. Thus showcasing the fact that by the teacher insisting on using binary gendered language to assign the thesis topics they took are forcing a narrative upon you that does not fit, thus becoming the husband in the short story.

Side note, I've always loved The Yellow Wallpaper for exactly the fact that there are so many ways to interpret the story without ever being explicitly right or wrong.

Edit: grammar
This. Men don’t need help sympathizing with John.
I agree I was doublely disappointed that male was assigned sympathy of the male protagonist. If the goal is to challenge preconceptions about the world, this assignment is not doing that.

You probably may, you never know. But it sucks that the assignment is based on birth month. Like it would make more sense if it was first initial or last name initial type of thing that you could decide.
Discrimination based on gender
I’m a professor myself. I would recommend that for the credit, you do the assignment, picking whichever gender you think fits you best on the day you’re doing it, or whichever gender’s prompt you like best at the time, or else flipping a coin since they’re all shitty prompts. As for reporting, you could wait until you talked to the prof after her return.
idk how to say it without getting cussed out or called transphobic. i can see both perspectives, both reasons why the other is wrong or why they are right. 

i dont need people to tell me why its wrong, i know why its wrong, i just understand that people always think its not a big deal. ive already accepted that people arent going to change, ive already accepted that people arent going to empathise with the lgbtq community. or maybe they simply cant empathise, they dont know that its a big deal. they always say ""suck it up"" because they think its fine. now i want to say that the truth is, its not a big deal, but i know i cant, and i know that it isnt for some people.

its a way to make groupings more fun and interesting,  i realise that, and it works considering how boring school work is. 

i realise now i may or may not have phrased my first comment wrong, what i mean is that i believe it is wrong, but i understand from their perspective on why its okay.
Yeah where the fuck was the critical thinking in designing this assignment? does it not make more sense to have the men think about why the husband is being patriarchal and controlling and to have the women look at why the husband might think he’s trying to help even if they appear uncaring?
Not only that, but the author wrote something called ""Why I Wrote the Yellow Wallpaper"" and she confirmed that it was about being treated badly by male mental health professionals. The fucking author herself confirmed that the main character is the victim and John was a POS.
(Not relevant to OP at all but) I am heartened somewhat that it's the sciences that are evenly split 😊
Thesis Defense and Interperetation Lessons Should Not Be Mixed.

There is a difference between ""Here is an assigned thesis defend it no matter how fucked up it is"" and something like ""Here's an interperetation try and dissect how someone would come to think it and then discuss how defensible you find it.""
This assignment actually surprised me most because of its limited interpretations of the story. I always thought of it as more nuanced than all of these - it's about more than power to John. It's about the societal expectation that a man be able to care for his wife in a way that makes her well, especially being a doctor himself. He actually thinks he is protecting her from herself and ruining his reputation by keeping her in there under the guise of love. It's more complicated in the sense that John is acting on society's expectations at the time for the best way to provide care, which turned out to be damaging for mental health - seclusion and ""bedrest"" for depression is the opposite of helping. It not only addresses feminism but also the medical model of Healthcare. Beautiful stuff. Really loved reading it in college and discussing it. This assignment reeks of misogyny and a lack of understanding that we exist.
Just adding here…

https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/theliteratureofprescription/exhibitionAssets/digitalDocs/The-Yellow-Wall-Paper.pdf

In case anyone was interested.

I also assume it’s THIS story that the assignment is about…

This site is a free version of the story where I am, hopefully also free for all….
That is the story and the plot, yes. I think we're interpreting the prompts fairly differently though, the one about John caring for the narrator and being well-meaning says nothing about having a 'right' to imprison his wife; I interpreted it as having the potential to be an analysis of intent vs impact, and is more of a character assessment than anything.

I don't disagree that having the men of the class write in defense of a man who clearly abused his wife is tasteless and potentially harmful, but John's motives are a valid topic to write on, and the prompt doesn't imply his actions were justified at all-- that's an entirely different thesis.
Yeah, the guy in this shitty thesis assignment must be related to Mr. Rochester from Jane Eyre?🫣
I guess I was reading too far past the prompts' face-values, haha. I thought a literal reading could be an interesting twist, and figured the class had likely already gone over the actual intentions of the story and commentary that Gilman was making, so I saw the prompt not so much ignoring what The Yellow Wallpaper says as a fiction, but playing with what it would mean as a real journal, as it was written in-universe by the character of the narrator... if that makes any sense. But that completely ignores that in-universe the narrator is experiencing hallucinations and the implications that come with that.

I agree completely about the prompt about John, I was thinking too much about what **I'd** write if given this assignment, and I would've taken the impact vs intent approach with a focus on impact, but ignored that the prompt does not set a student up for that, and definitely frames the feelings of an abuser as the focal point.

I appreciate your thoughts!! It sucks a little to realize my interpretation was naive, but that's not your fault and I took no offense from reading your perspective. I appreciate the clarification of tone as well and want to echo it haha!
The idea that there wasn't conservative women or progressive men, would be very reductive.
Minor update I still haven’t received a response
Okay but I actually love this angle for analysis.
Noted, thank you.
>what i mean is that i believe it is wrong, but i understand from their perspective on why its okay.

Okay that makes more sense for sure. Yeah it's clear that from their perspective there's nothing harmful about how it's done

But nahhh ... splitting them into groups is all fair and good, but doing it by gender this way – as well as tasking half the males with *defending an abusive husband* – is just not even remotely a good way to do it
this was exactly my thought. if they're going to gender something like this at least use it to broaden people's mindsets a bit
In my moms english class she does a lense assignment where everyone is randomly assigned a lense and she says its really annoying how painfully slow it takes some guys to understand a feminist lense.
If this is about Charlotte Perkins Gilman, i just learned that this author was very very racist even for her own time. I'm bringing this up bc i think it's important not to divorce an author from their work even if their work does have value not tied to their bigotry, especially since their bigotry may even seep into the work. You know, the easiest example is Rowling where you may like the books, and they teach some generalized good values but also have anti-Semitism and racism weaved throughout. If someone recommended Rowling today I'd wonder if they didn't know about the bigotry or didn't care. (I'm not saying this about you or anyone else in the thread I'm just saying all this in case someone wants to read the book, that they're aware!)
Depends on the science but definitely when taken overall! Comp sci, physics and to some degree chemistry are still male dominated. Biology is female dominated (I say this as a trans guy who's a biologist, although I'm a bioinformatician, so I did pick the most male-dominated subfield). So classes like ochem and biochemistry which are taken by chem majors and bio majors (all premeds in general) end up more evenly split. 

It's really the humanities and social sciences that lean the most heavily toward one gender. My little sister is studying speech-language pathology at the same school where I did my undergrad and every. single. student. in her cohort of 60 people is a cis woman -- not one man or trans person. Part of it is ofc going to be a product of the fact that there are more women who get college degrees than men so when a major is female dominated, it can be *really female dominated.* But I also think there's less stigma for women in male-dominated fields than the reverse. ""Breaking down barriers"" vs ""intruding"" or [insert homophobic slur here].
Yes exactly this. ""Support or oppose this interpretation"" it involves more thought to it as well. If I *just* have to support a statement it's easy to do becausei just have to pick out a few supporting points and defend it. But if I'm faced with needing to support or oppose it. I have to think about which option would be most sensible to defend given the informstion on hand, and not just make the argument to support it--but make the argument for why you are supporting it instead of opposing it (or vice versa).
Yeah, I can see where you're coming from about the second prompt. Like, the more I think about it, a literal haunting doesn't necessarily detract from the piece thematically. Like, if you read it that way, John's still ultimately responsible- he brought the narrator out to the house, insisted on putting her in a haunted room, and ignored her (correctly) identifying that there was a ghost. Plus that creates room for interesting parallels between the ghost of a woman who presumably also suffered under misogyny ultimately harming the narrator and the other women who help John control the narrator- I think you could get a solid analysis paper out of that reading.

The prompt's still complete dogshit because the instructions are all about finding evidence for the haunting rather than analyzing what it means, but thinking about the story in the lens of ""this is all real and the narrator imagined nothing"" is interesting food for thought.
Thank you for this heads up! I'd forgotten all about that tbh
Knowing how male-dominated sciences are in general is what make it so warm to me to hear it being relatively even in some sciences 😊

Yeah the humanities you've described matches with my experiences too. Ugh, *intruding.* Can't wait for that to be a relic of the past

The shorts are way too short. I was raised in a tolerant family so I can't say myself. but there are people out there who will restrict the clothing there child's wear to an astonishing degree.

i’d just think you were european lol but i kinda see what you mean, I don’t understand why people worry about what their kids wear as long as it’s not inappropriate for a child obviously... you look great tho rock it nd be confident!
Can I join the Indy Enby club!  I am a fellow Hoosier!
I'm a Hoosier AKA the op's nationality and I've seen a lot of Evangelical and conservative limit and forced a child to wear something. A lot of times these shorts would immediately get you into trouble because you can see your butt and that's promoting sex
Enby hoosier club! it’s tough as shit being a queer here, but finding the right people feels so good. greetings from cbus!
Me, a nonbinary Region Rat, torn between the Hoosier State and Chicago
well i guess if they feel it’s too revealing for children at least i guess that’s their call but a bit extreme it’s just summertime
Born and raised in the biggest little town (Indianapolis, that used to be slogan serious) there's a magical high School called heron where every single person is gay. Legit I'm not lying they're like so many gay by and trans people most of my friends are queer I think I know one no two straight sis people. (Not including teachers) And there's a GSA, and I think around there is also a club for queer youth. So yeah not trying to do diminish your hardships I'm just trying to give you hope.
Yeah I have the same idea and I honestly believe the older the child is the less control you should have over their wardrobe.
i absolutely love this story, and i’m so very glad! i will admit, i did know some queer folx from school, including meeting some of my very first trans people! it was liberating knowing i wasn’t alone in being queer

Things are slowwwwly getting better with surveys		"At least theyre trying i guess. I kinda feel like “which describes your gender identity” and “do you identify as transgender” should be different questions - having “male” and “transgender male” be separate gender identities seems very… not great
I appreciate the intention but this feels very Cis™
If I was the one who made this:

Which of the following terms best describes your gender identity?
- Man
- Woman
- Nonbinary
- Not listed here
- Decide not to answer
Most of the things that ask questions about gender identity should get ""decline to answer.""
Are you a trans man/woman or a normal one?
""You're doing great buddy, I'm proud of you""
I don't think our employers/government/census takers need to know anything other than our pref pronouns. Our doctors however do need to know about our genitals.
Me: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
It bothers me, not only that these are worded in a very odd way, but that most of these surveys don't need to know gender. Specially in academic studies people act as is gender was THE defining characteristic of a human being. I just saw a pharmaceutical study about drug abuse that had three, THREE, questions regarding gender. It was less than 20 questions and they dedicated three to gender?!? Maybe it's just me, but I'd love gender to be less present in daily life.
as much as i love people trying to be more inclusive, putting man/woman and trans man/woman as seperate things without specifying 'cis' in the first one is kinda😬
i reallllly don’t sit well with trans man and trans woman being different categories from just male and female. like that’s not what gender identity is. if they were asking about gender identity they could just have man, woman, nonbinary, or other
This is not good at all. I am a researcher and unfortunately it is common practice to use the incorrect words to describe sex and gender, and to use a closed and non-inclusive list of options.

The misuse of male/female and man/woman is an issue in almost every field. 

Even though it's going to be harder to analyze, this sort of question has to be open text to allow people to write whatever they want, and it's up to the researcher to make an effort to analyze it.

Both sex and gender are proper questions to be asked, if you need them, but you must allow the participant to give a proper answer or your results won't be very good.
Surley trans man and women would just me male and female tho
My favorite is getting a question asking my gender, much like the sample above, and a few questions later being asked the same thing and the only choices are male and female. Uh, what?
Just give a text box.
I feel like these surveys should break these kinds of questions down a bit. Like instead of just asking for your ""gender identity"" and giving 15 options,  break it down into two or three separate questions such as:

Sex: 
•male
•female
•decline to answer

Do you identify as transgender, nonbinary, or otherwise genderqueer? 
•yes
•no
•decline to answer

What are your pronouns? (Select all that apply)
•he/him
•she/her
•they/them
•other ______

Like, that sort of format feels more inviting to me, and allows me to customize what information I share about myself. It's inclusive without being overwhelming.
This has 

* man
* woman
* trans 

vibes and I hate it aslxkjxsa
Still waiting for the day people will understand that the main problem is not in the answers, it's in asking the question.
I’ve seen a lot recently that say “intersex/undetermined,” which I don’t feel comfortable selecting, especially if the question asks for sex instead of gender.
I genuinely think it would be more useful if it were just man, woman, non-binary/other, decline to answer.
Instead of ""gender not listed here"" I read ""gender not needed"" 💀
Could be shortened and improved so easily.

Q1) Does your gender identity differ from the one you were assigned at birth?

Q2) Please describe your gender identity.
Always Find It Kinda Odd When Things Have Genderqueer As An Option But Not Non-Binary, Isn't Non-Binary A More Common Term?
At least they tried... If you can, I'd do my best to address it without getting mad. There's so much conflicting info online, they probably did the best they could in the time allotted.
I mean, yeah, they've got the spirit and all, but how hard is it to do:

What are you?

* Guy
* Gal
* None of the above

(not that that would be perfect, but how is that not the first draft that comes to mind?)
Two-spirit. TWO... SPIRIT... what is that lmfaoigbytyubdyudnggcrv
Two Spirit sounds nice
This might be a dumb question but what's two spirit?
what's two-spirit? I've never heard of the term I'd like to know more
Tbh, I'm fine with male/female/other/prefer not to say. A ton of different options that are frankly always in flux anyhow just makes things stressful for those of us who don't like feeling pressured into labels.
Hmm I am a genderqueer demiwoman and I don't know what I'd choose.
Fr I be like other
I agree should be “cisgender male” and “transgender male” since both are “male.” I really don’t like how they seem to imply that male would not include transgender male.
Given this is a survey most likely developed by cishet people and there are an innumerable ways of people identifying and relating with their gender identity, the prospect of them getting a survey which caters to absolutely everybody’s sensitivities is next to impossible.
I believe this is a question from the 2022 US National Trans Survey, which I took a few months ago.  

One goal of the survey was to show how previously existing surveys fit - or rather didn’t fit - with the lived experiences of trans people, so some questions were taken directly from those surveys (think the census) and asked again. I think the above question is one such example. 

I believe the intention in asking these “CisTM” (great expression btw) questions again in this survey was to find ways to better survey to thus better support the trans community in the future.
And make it 'Mark all that apply'.

Next question: ""Is your gender identity different from the one assigned to you at birth?""
[deleted]
Could just make it a fill in the blank.
Yeahhhhh. This question was actually to weed out any non-men since the survey was to see how men felt about pyschotherapy, so I kinda wonder now if I chose trans man if it would have kicked me out of the survey...
""Wowee, I think there's a special spot on the fridge just waiting for these gender options!""
I think for a large-scale census knowing the gender of people can be helpful so it's harder to argue that non-binary people don't exist and knowing how gender skews in certain environments can inform anti-discrimination policy.

However, I do agree that gender is a default question in a lot of questionnaires where it just doesn't matter.
Academic research is weird sometimes. I am a researcher and I agree with you, gender should be asked if relevant to the study itself. Sometimes it is, sometimes it is not. It really depends on what you are studying, what is your hypothesis, etc etc.
Anyone can feel free to correct me but I'm fairly certain Two Spirit is specific to Indigenous people and maybe even specific tribes, tho I'm not sure.
I prefer when sex assigned at birth is a separate question
I dont think this is from that survey, i remember that having wayyyyy more options for identity, and you were able to select multiple
In all fairness, if you're specifically researching the difference between trans and cis people then there should be two versions of the binary genders.
I don’t know if that’s inclusive to intersex folks tbh, but I definitely like the first idea
True, but if you’d rather simplify it so that you don’t have a plethora of choices, that’s the list above. Ideally you’d have a few options of “common” choices, then a search function for more specific identities if you don’t fall under the common choices
True, but that brings the added difficulty of when people write something stupid to troll the survey. Not to mention, organizing all possible responses might be a nightmare. For example, someone could write “female”, “woman”, “girl”, “trans woman”, “cis woman”, “trans female”, “cis female”, “trans girl”, or any other amount of variations that the system would have to account for. It’s a lot of extra work for the people making the surveys with no little reward for doing so.
You're correct. Though, I'd like to add that Two Spirit is a Pan-Indian term that covers many different (and not all) North American tribes' distinct genders. So, it's an umbrella term kinda like Non-binary, except that most tribe members would identify with the gender unique to their specific tribe -- e.g., the *Lhamana* living in the Zuni tribe -- instead of simply calling themselves Two Spirit.
You are correct.
Yeah male and female are sex not gender. Always weirds me out because when those are options, you know they're asking about genitals and like why do you want to know that. I want no knowledge of random peoples genitals
I remember this question specifically, in part because it made a friend angry, but I also remember it was either followed with or preceded by a much better question along the lines of what you’re describing.

I could be misremembering thiugh
Do you have a suggestion about how to make my question more inclusive for intersex people?

I'd probably include a third question about being intersex. The first is to establish your gender, the second to establish if your gender is different from your AGAB (since that is the basic definition of being trans), and the third to establish if you're intersex. Typically in a questionnaire you only want to ask a single thing at a time.
[deleted]
I am currently doing a survey with an open text answer for both sex assigned at birth and gender, and I have the usual stupid answers like ""helicopter"". That's pretty common.

Yes, it's annoying to spend time to analyze them because of the many variations, but the reward is that you are doing your job properly. Like, it is my duty as a scientist to do my job properly, otherwise the results provided are not technically correct.

If gender matters for my analysis, not being able to have appropriate gender descriptors will obviously impact how I present my results.
This question was on the 2022 US National Trans Survey I believe and was followed by a much more detailed, choose-all-that-apply gender identification question.

However, this is a picture from my community behavioral health center, and I was just surprised that they updated it to include descriptions with non-binary gender identities and removed the unneeded ""Male-to-Female"" stuff.
No, I’m not intersex and I don’t know enough about intersex people to say. I just thought it may be a concern
That's a bit tough and I'm not sure it works the same way for intersex people. I was born intersex but ""assigned"" female, which feels kind of useless to me as it doesn't indicate anything real. It's not information about how I was born, it's just what they decided for me. So while I would say sure my gender identity is different than my ""assigned"" one, it still feels a bit weird you know?  

I don't want to put it as ""does your gender identity match your biological sex?"" because that's  problematic too, but I'm not sure how to do better if we're already asking about the circumstances of someone's birth
Yep, and expanding somewhat is good, so you don’t have to go through the effort of combining (and deciding whether to) things like NB, enby, non-binary, nonbinary, different capitalizations and such, that would make actually collecting the data harder
Oh interesting. Thank you for letting me know!
Yeah, hm. I could have put the question like ""Do you identify as transgender?"" But I was thinking about nonbinary people who don't identify as trans. I guess a researcher would know, though, because the person marked nonbinary in the previous question, and it would have the added benefit of giving data on the number of nonbinary people who don't identify as trans."	1039f9p	NonBinary	994	0.99	2023-01-04 17:30:29
I love seeing surveys be more inclusive of other gender identities these days.		"It always bothers me how they put male and female separate from trans male and trans female, like at least make it cis male/female then instead of separating trans individuals from their gender
""Transgender male"" and ""transgender female"" are not gender identities tho (binary trans people's gender is either ""man"" or ""woman""). If they wanted to know if one is cis or trans, there should be another question for that.
i agree with other comments about trans men and trans women being put as separate. I understand some places might need to know for medical reason, then i suppose it is okay, and same in case there are anti discriminatory practices/needed, but it would be nice to have it as a separate question. like: cis or trans
\>decline to answer

my gender is **no**
Only nitpick is 'male and female"" are different from ""transgender male and transgender female."" Other than that it's cool
*Gender fluid is running around screaming*
A step close to the optimal answer sheet

I'm sad that agender or no gender isn't an option. Like.. OK I have to pick a gender now?
why even ask tho
An EXCELLENT sign!!!
Meanwhile in the UK we don't even get an ""other"" option on government forms.
I agree, but I think it might trying to distinguish gender minorities from cis folks for a reason.  The survey is about healthcare, and there's lots of questions that ask about how accessible Healthcare is to different people. Like, if you don't speak English, how hard was it to find accommodations?   Or, if an overwhelming majority of trans/gender minorities answer that their provider didn't listen to them or give adequate care, that's useful data.

But it still feels icky.
A large portion of cis people don't know that that's an accurate term for them, they wouldn't tick the box. Like before I learned about trans people I accidentally said I was on a form, several years before I realised I actually am.

That’s fair, but it’s still a step in the right direction.
agender_irl
We agenders are still under the non-binary umbrella. At least we aren’t totally left out like enbies so often are
So the data can be divided into various data groups based on demographic information gathered from the survey.  This allows the data to be analyzed across different groups of people.  

For example, a researcher might find a trend that Hispanic respondants who don't speak English as a first language see telehealth as a barrier to Healthcare. (These are just hypotheticals).  Or, that gender minorities don't feel that their GP is trying to help them.  The data can be split more if the survey asks for geographical info.  For example,  the former statement about gender minorities may not be true for respondants on the east coast, etc.  It's a way of viewing the data from different lenses, all of which are useful when action is to be taken to fix desparities and shortcomings for certain groups, if they exist.

One can also just decline to answer, too.
Yeah I get you sometimes need the separation, but using cis-male and cis-female would make it inclusive and still just as correct, could even make * and describe cis so people outside of the loop still know what to answer
I can't tell if this is a copy pasta or you genuinely thought this was the right place to put that opinion.

SEX (if I'm not mistaken) is your primary sexual characteristics (penis and testicles or vagina and uterus).

Gender is not so rigit, and is basically (over simplified) your brains sex, transgender means your gender doesn't align with your sex assigned at birth.

After looking through your comment I don't think I can find a single correct fact, although I'd happily reconsider my definitions if you can give me some sources to scientific papers supporting your claims
wrong
I'm agender but I don't consider myself nonbinary because to me that still indicates some kind of gender, but I have none. I personally would like a no gender option, because in my eyes it's different from enby.
Oh I get what you mean now.  That totally makes sense.
My favorites are the ones that have a choose all that apply so for peeps that are transfem enby like myself you can check trans and female and non binary. Even for binary trans folks getting to check female/male and then trans separately instead of them being completely exclusive I would imagine feels better.
The issue may be that a lot of people don't actually know what cis means. Many of my friends, who never had trouble questioning their gender and don't follow the LGBTQ scene don't know what the majority of gender terms mean. If they happened not to find ""male"" and ""female"" as options, they wouldn't really know what to answer. Also they have always thought about themselves as male and female, not as cis-male or cis-female while a trans-male for example knows perfectly that he's trans. It would be necessary to put a little explanation of all the options so I guess that who writes the surveis considers it easier just to write male and female. I don't see anything bad about it as I wouldn't see anything bad if they changed it if more cis people would know what cis means and think about themselves as cis.
I honestly didn't know what cis meant for awhile lol.
This is such a great idea.
Non-binary just means you’re not one of the “traditional” cis genders though, it doesn’t imply you have a different one.
I could also see how changing it to ""cis woman"" could be a barrier to people with low literacy. I would prefer to ask one question about gender identity, and a follow-up about trans identity. That would also distinguish nonbinary vs trans nonbinary, which could offer interesting insights. Survey design gets complicated very quickly if you're actually committed to doing a good job. But plenty of researchers don't even make the effort so I give this one an A for effort and B- for execution. 🏳️‍⚧️
Most people would assume nonbinary people have some kind of a gender or a mix of genders. Sure agender is included in nonbinary, but to me it's a bit different by definition. If I were to answer this gender question it would be ""decline to answer""
100% agree it should be a separate follow-up question asking if you consider yourself trans. It should be optional and have ""unsure"" and/or ""it's complicated"" or something similar as an option. I really can't answer that with a simple yes or no and I'm sure I'm not the only one, lol.

Besides cis people not understanding that cis applies to them, I'm sure plenty of binary trans folks would like to be able to choose male/female without having to out themselves as trans, or claim to be cis. So, making the only options for male & female include cis or trans would probably not be great.
>100% agree it should be a separate follow-up question asking if you consider yourself trans. It should be optional and have ""unsure"" and/or ""it's complicated"" or something similar as an option. I really can't answer that with a simple yes or no and I'm sure I'm not the only one, lol.

Idk, I feel like this would get complicated quickly? Because what being 'trans' means to people collecting data vs. what it means to people on a personal level might differ. I'd imagine from a data collecting point of view it might just mean 'people who are a gender minority/not cis' as you're trying to ascertain the needs of that entire group, so it might not take into account personal nuances and feelings that lead people to use or not use that word even while being a gender minority. 

Like I do consider myself trans but I often run into people who think nonbinary people are 'coopting' that word or intercepting a conversation that isn't theirs, from both exclusionary binary trans people and even non binary people who have internalized that and avoid it for that reason. Or even just nonbinary people who don't feel comfortable using it because they feel ot doesn't match their experience or feel right (which is of course completely okay). And there's a lot of connotations with that word to physical transition and being binary that I think are kinda problematic but very influential. I feel like the survey would have to make clear what they mean by 'trans', or at least provide options for people to explain why they do or don't use the word ('because I am/am not transitioning', 'because I have a different gender than my assigned one', because I'm a binary man or woman', etc.). Because there's a weird thing where the technical definition of the word 'trans' is that it's essentially a synonym for 'non-cis' but the actual working assumption outside of trans spaces (and even inside of them) is that trans=binary trans and nonbinary people usually use the word 'trans' to signify a desire to transition or some experience of dysphoria or transmasculinity or transfemininity.  And as someone who doesn't fit that who *does* use that word, I wouldn't want that assumption made of me, nor would I want that problematic assumption reiterated. I think what you're saying would make sense if in the follow up trans question they made clear their working definition of 'trans', asked people whether they identified with that word, and why/why not, so there isn't an assumption that the data collectors and responders are using the same definition of 'trans' when they might not be.
Well, maybe it would be simplest to exclude the word trans altogether and just ask whether or not the gender they identify with is the same one they were assigned at birth. It's a less loaded question, and much more straight forward for me to answer (as someone who does not actively describe themself as trans, yet is non-cis and part of the greater trans community). If they tried to define trans and ask people to answer based on their definition, whatever that definition might be, someone would get pissed, and it could easily cause a shit storm.
I love this response. My personal approach is to consider the user when writing the survey, and the audience when writing the report. While what we're describing is a complicated question, it allows people to self identify in nuanced ways. This could reduce the potential number of people who say ""this research team doesn't understand people like me,"" and quit. When compiling this data, I would analyze the question responses straight up, and then aggregate trends within cis-nonbinary, trans, genderqueer, and unsure (because ""questioning"" is a distinctly queer experience which can take decades.) That way you have a clear delineation between folks with ""gender stuff"" and everyone else. 

Side note: language is important here, and also good surveys should be population specific. So because this is all hypothetical, I'm not giving my word choices a lot of thought. 

TLDR; surveys should be affirming of diverse identity without compromising data collection
That's is the literal scientific of transgender ""person who's gender identity is different from the one assigned at birth""

All other things about being trans like transition, state of genitals, their actual identity, their biological sex, their AGAB, etc. etc. are simply assumptions and wrong in many cases. Being trans has nothing to do with a lot of stuff people assume it does.
>If they tried to define trans and ask people to answer based on their definition, whatever that definition might be, someone would get pissed, and it could easily cause a shit storm.

Well I mean the generally accepted definition of trans is 'identifying as a gender different the one assigned at birth' with the choice to opt in (meaning people aren't forced to identify that way if they're non-cis but don't like the word trans) so I don't think that would be too controversial of a definition for them to work off of. To me the best approach is usually the most inclusive and comprehensive one. They could use that definition and then ask people from that point onward whether they actually use the label in a practical sense in day to day life and why (which gives room for other more personal interpretations of the word as applied to individuals). Or maybe that is convoluted and it's better to leave the word out. Idk. I don't design surveys, so I can't say what the best and most workable approach is tbh. I was just adding another perspective to the issue.
Okay, but I see people aggressively arguing against that definition all the time (both transmeds and clueless cis people alike), and a lot of people who meet that definition would not describe themselves as trans, either due to the assumptions about that word or otherwise.

I personally never call myself trans, because I don't find it a useful term when the majority of people will assume I'm binary trans and physically transitioning. I will stick up for any non-binary person who wants to use the trans label, because they should have the right to do so, but for me personally....eh, not worth it. Like a lot of agender people, I don't really feel connected to the idea of being trans. Am I? Yes, no, maybe, whatever. I don't want to argue about it either way. I find the whole concept of gender confusing, frustrating and alienating.

I don't mind being included under the trans umbrella, but I hate it when people try to force the word trans on non-binary people who don't want to use it, especially when they accuse them of being transphobic for it. It would be like insisting all pansexuals are bisexual because they fit the definition and not using the term bi makes them biphobic. Like yeah, I guess technically they could be bi, but if they don't want to call themselves bi, let them be.
I think the issue is that the people who argue against this definition are usually ignorant or using transphobia to make their arguments. They have very little valid ground for argumentation and that definition is becoming the most consistently used one. It's fine if individual nonbinary people don't identify with the word trans because of personal or social experience, it's a lot more complex on a personal level for many people, but at least to my knowledge, when it comes to research and policy and organizing, the word trans usually means 'non-cis' or people who experience gender outside of the cis norm, or at the very least it is starting to (more actively include nonbinary people). The world does assume trans = binary trans, but it also usually takes trans to mean gender minority or someone with 'gender stuff', so on a group level there is utility to having us be under that umbrella, or else our rights and concerns tend to get ignored. I know many people who are (unfortunately) only taken seriously in their search for medical or even just legal and/or social transition (with no surgery) when they use the word 'trans' because that word has more weight and more history behind it, and there is a lot of benefit to nonbinary people allying with binary trans people under the word 'trans' when it comes to fighting for rights because of the history of activism associated with it (a lot of which has also been performed by nonbinary and genderqueer people themselves! The white stripe in the trans flag does stand for nonbinary, after all). 

So on a *personal* level people should have the freedom to opt in or out but on a *group* level until there is a different word that more generally means non-cis (and until the trans/cis binary goes away) 'trans' is the best word to use collectively fight for rights that are mutual to a lot of non-cis people. I'm agender and feel alienated from gender but I also need the activism and organizing that is often performed under the trans umbrella. Even if I didn't use the word trans personally, I'd still feel that the inclusive definition is the correct and most useful one, at least for now. Because in my experience most arguments against it (as in actively exclusionary arguments as opposed to letting enbies choose to opt in or out) are not coming from people who want to give nonbinary people more room to identify outside of the rigid trans/cis binary, but from people who want to alienate us from a community that has resources we need because of their own enbyphobia.
I get where your coming from. It does make sense to be able to group all non-cis people together as gender minorities. At the moment, you're probably right that trans is the best word we have. I do hope the language we use continues to evolve in a positive way, though. I think gender non-conforming cis people deserve to be included more often, too. I personally felt more included by trans\*, but that seems to be dead and gone, and I don't think TGNCNB will ever really catch on.

Regardless of the best definition of trans we have at the moment, and the importance of being able to unite, there still are non-binary people who don't like the idea of still being boxed into the cis/trans binary, and some use terms like metagender to reject it. There are *always* gray areas. I really hate statements like, ""if you're not cis, you're trans,"" because it also implies the inverse, ""if you're not trans, you're cis."" It feels like telling people who are questioning or haven't adapted the trans label for themselves that they are actually cis.

We won't be solving the ignorance/transphobia/enbyphobia problem anytime soon, either. Most people don't want to be educated and aren't willing to change their way of thinking. There are a lot of very loud/aggressive binary trans people who reject non-binary people as trans, especially those who don't want to physically transition, because they think they somehow hurt the trans community. It's awful. And I think this attitude coming from within the community is more harmful than when it comes from the outside..."	o9eyhr	NonBinary	968	0.99	2021-06-28 07:00:32
We’re not all transmasc 🫠	"That’s it. That’s the rant. 

But, honestly, I’m getting extremely fed up with queer spaces and representation of non-binary people as AFAB people who want to be masculine. It seems that’s what everyone assumes when I tell them I’m non-binary, I basically want to be seen and treated as some flavor of “boy” which couldn’t be further from the truth! I don’t want to look like a boy— the idea gives me so much dysphoria. 

Of course, it’s not the fault of transmascs— it’s the fault of cis society for building up gender roles and expectations for an identity that is intentionally subverting that!!! Makes me want to yell!!! 

I hate feeling like I can’t belong in non-binary spaces because I don’t want top surgery or a beard or to be seen as a guy. I also hate that I don’t get to see nearly as much of transfems (whom I adore) and a wider range of non-binary masculinity and people who simply do not wish to present in either direction or don’t care how they’re received. 

But, that’s why I love this sub. I see lots of different types of enbies here and I love y’all so much."	"I'm an enby trans guy, and I've definitely noticed something too...

Representation of binary trans people is mostly about transfemmes

While with enbies it's transmascs

Binary trans guys and enby transfemmes get ignored so often, and it's awful
Yeh, amab enby here.

Hard to explain that I am not a gay fem-boy not that I am afab..so annoying
I blame the societal idea that women wanting to be men is normal and makes sense. Men being woman? Why would you want to take a lesser position? 

I am also very annoyed that nonbinary=skinnywhiteandrogeny. I get so jealous of amab nbs with glorious beards and beautiful dresses.
AMAB here and I’m hella confused with my own gender. I thought it would become clearer as I got older. I was wrong. 

A little lullaby for anyone who’s confused like me

https://youtu.be/aXAU4MmMIMo
literally this! Like I can be an afab enby without necessarily wanting to transition or look androgynous. I mean, I'm happy for the representation we get and I'm happy for any enbies who are fitting the ""ideal"" and being happy, but...

# Nonbinary people don't owe anyone androgyny.

# Nonbinary people don't owe anyone they/them pronouns.

# Nonbinary people don't have to transition.

Sure, again, everyone who does those things is valid, but after being nonbinary because we don't fit into society's expectation, society really just *created a whole new set of expectations?*Like we just want to exist, why is it so hard for society?
I feel like even “progressive” cis people think like this because they can only view non binaryness as in in of its self a “gender” rather than a generalization of a more complex and extremely varied emotion
Not to mention I’m a femme AFAB enby… like I kept my she/her pronouns I just kind of reject the concept of “woman” because I don’t feel like one. It’s really hard to explain but hopefully some folks here get it. (Also I’m old and rather than explain to people my gender identity I just kind of… do agender things mostly - imagine kind of a grunge aesthetic I gusss?)
I’m an AMAB enby. A mythical creature
Its weird because everyone automatically assumes all (binary) trans people are trans women, but all non-binary trans people are AFAB?
This is the only place I feel like my gender has been fully validated/understood/seen and where I've seen people just accept others as they are. Even when negative comments come in, they get taken down quickly.
As an AMAB enby I feel this so much. The misconception and push for androgyny or full transition can be quite annoying. Like I just want to look a little softer and maybe wear a wig, I don't have any interest in HRT nor do I think I'm a girl (for that matter I barely identify as a boy) I'm non-binary. That being said if you're looking for more trans fems I've seen them more on dedicated trans pages where they still say they're non-binary but seem to also know they don't get a lot of attention on non-binary pages.
Idk about anyone else but this issue makes me want to avoid these spaces all together. I'm often left with dysphoria triggered feeling like i don't belong.
It sucks that when telling some cis people that you’re nonbinary they automatically try to fit you into the box “boy nonbinary” or “girl nonbinary” which defeats the point entirely 😭😭
AFAB fluid enby here. While I do make efforts to look less feminine, that's more to be perceived as nonbinary, not necessarily as masculine. I avoid the term ""trans"" for the very reason you described. By definition, I *am* trans, but for the gods' sake, I'm not transmasc!
I get that 100%. I’m amab, but I don’t push any sort of fem/masc behaviors. Ideally, I try to be neutral, but not necessarily androgynous or whatever. I simply prefer to be comfortable with myself
i stopped giving a shit like a year ago i think
it sucks how people keep trying to put non-binary folks in binary boxes, even within the non-binary umbrella.
Damn I get the opposite. Everyone I know thinks non-binary people are just Women Lite™️ and I despise it so so much. 😔
I feel this so hard
Also the idea that non-binary = androgynous. Some of us are more fem presenting and some have a more masc appearance and its ridiculous to expect that all nb people fit into one stereotype of how we ""should"" look because it's someone's expectation. We're very diverse and that should be celebrated
I get you. I primarily ID as trans femme now because someone amab identifying as non-binary was just too much for people to handle, and I got sick to death of the same stupid comments. Not to mention all the 'women and non-binary' groups that are ONLY for afab people. 'Non-binary fashion' is always man-lite - shirt, suit, waistcoat, etc., etc., just cut for a different shape.

So yeah, I'm non-binary trans femme. I'm not always femme, often I'm agender, but never masc, but try explaining that for the n'th time, and it's so much easier to say trans
Amab nb/agender/bigender? (male +, expanded male? Soft masc trans lesbian?) on hrt for the last year. 40 yo husband/parent of 4. Active LDS.

I feel like a minority of a minority within a majority. Some of this, some of that, not enough of this, too much of that.

I've only just allowed myself to honestly accept and think about this part of me. I'm still figuring things out. I wish I knew more people like me, and people not quite like me. Just trying to find a place to belong and help.
Amab here and I feel this. I am transfeminine but I kinda worry that if I tell more people that I'm NB they'll think I want to be viewed more masc which is really not what I want.
I'm non binary and if you call me transmasc you offend me since I am agender. I am sick and tired of anyone who conflates presentation with gender.
Yes! Like I don’t care what you call me! I’m a person. I don’t even care if you get my name or pronouns right that much lol. Anything works, I’d rather focus on important things like solving public health and scientific crises, and learning and sharing information, not centering minor details like how my body looks in the conversation . I like looking androgynous and gender neutral language. My body is my body and it’s not perfectly androgynous so I guess I just cope.🧍I have short hair I eat healthy and I exercise- which to me is what’s important. I feel a small connection to my agab but that’s it and not the same way my peers do. 🫠 that’s it I’m pretty boring actually
I want to express as cool and comfortable in baggy tie dye...instead, I present as hot and anxious in baggy tie dye. Mostly, just appear as a cis AMAB dumpster fire, lol. I live in one of the spicier states. Also, this is the only place I have any interaction with this community or similar, so I really don't have positive or negative stories of how I am perceived. Maybe I shouldn't have shared, sorry if I distracted from the issues at hand.
As a short AMAB enby who mostly dresses like a butch woman because I did that for decades when I was closeted and it still feels right and any ""fem"" stuff feels like my male femboy side of my gender.... ugh.
Honestly it's *really* hard for me to accept the label of non binary for myself cause I don't use any pronouns besides she/her. Like I don't *feel* binary femme, like gnc trans woman I guess works but that also doesn't feel right. Like I'm woman but not. I'm a she/they transfemme minus the they.......like it's so difficult lol
So many people assume that I’m trans masc right off the bat whenever I say I’m non-binary so I’ve literally had to introduce myself in a manner which Is basically “my name is dusk, I use xey/xem pronouns and I will not hold back on punches if you call me anything that isn’t neutral” I obviously enjoy being called more feminine things with actual friends but so many people assume that I like being called a strong boy or a cute femboy or other such things just because being an afab enby is just so much more acceptable in this society
I'm afab, but my iteration of enby is 3rd gender, something not represented by the binary concept at all.  I also feel people just don't want to even try to understand. It's made me feel like an alien masquerading as a human my whole life, and that hasn't changed much since being out. We need recognition for ALL categories of human gender! I'm not a ""tomboy,"" dangit!
It's always like that: afab are expected to be transmasc and amab are expected to be transfem. The problem is that ""if you like to present masculine/feminine why do you say you're enby?"" 
Cis people usually can't understand ""non binarism"" and they think that it's mostly about looks, so if you don't look androgynous, or the opposite gender from your agab, then what's the problem with staying cis? You look the same, you look just like a ""normal boy/girl""
Transfemme enby, I do exist. /s

I agree. I recently read *Sissy* by Jacob Tobia (a non-binary, feminine presenting person) and they correctly pointed out that many people still operate in the gender-binary. So even if they want to be inclusive of other gender-identities, they often fall back on the binary. Trans people who often transition from one binary to another are given more attention since closely adheres to the binary we are used to. Its okay to want to be different, as long as you fit in. But people who aren't already involved in the gender conversation don't really understand the Non-Binary or Gender-Non-Conforming identity. Its not what they are used to.
As someone who’s amab and non-binary, my ultimate goal is to go on HRT and get as curvy as I can 😅
I'm an AFAB enby who previously was FTM, and I can  vouch that this is true. I was on the other side of the fence, and now I'm here.
I get the same remarks from people that I got when I was FTM. People don't know the difference.

The internet's perseption of non-binary people is basically just a short, skinny anime boy with a choppy haircut. Which is also the same perception they have about the ftm community.

If you're over 5'7 and you have long hair, people will literally roll their fucking eyes at you.

""When are you going to get top surgery? Have you started T yet? Why are you wearing a dress?""
I'M NOT TRANSMASC.
For me (afab), the only gender that’s less correct than “woman” is “man”. Non-binary is not some third gender, where you must transition toward “the middle” - it’s a constellation of options that rejects the binary to begin with. 💕
You're right. I hope your wishes come true. I am an enby who was afab and likes to be androgynous. Because of being misgendered as a girl for most of my life I struggle to accept any femininity I may poses. If I have to get misgendered as either a guy or a girl, I'd rather be misgendered as a guy, because it makes me feel like I look androgynous like I want. I don't want to look like a guy, I want to look androgynous, but being misgendered as a guy feels like making it even and landing on androgynous for some reason. Idk that was confusing. But there definitely needs to be more representation and acceptance of amab and transfem enbies.
I struggle so much with this too. I love being fem but the masc part of me is also quite strong. When i feel depressed or bad mentally… I lean to looking more masc passing. When I am in my element moisturized empowered fearless fairy witch I am more fem passing. 
For me the fem part always feels more like ”me” but the masc part is also a part of me, hence non binary. But sometimes I just feel like I am not non binary enough because I enjoy feeling femenine etc.
I so agree with you.
God yeah. Feeling like a “fake enby” because I wear dresses and still like girly things and occasionally using she/her is not fun.
It's just a further perpetuation of the ""tomboy"" acceptance rather than actual understanding of nonbinary people.
I HAVE BEEN JOURNALLING ABT THIS ALL WEEK DUDE THANK U.
I’ve actually never noticed this, and even myself being a transmasc enby, that upsets me. Like I wanna pass more masculinely because that’s how I feel, not because that’s how people are assuming enbies are supposed to be, ya know? Wishing you all the support and hood vibes for being your true self
i get what you’re saying but i would include that wanting top surgery but not wanting to be seen as anything boy adjacent and not wanting t as a non-binary person is really isolating. Anyone who acknowledges that ppl like me exist think its the flower and daisy path of being nonbinary and completely dismisses our struggles. Ppl assume i actually get gendered as nonbinary which is ABSURD. Not to mention there are systemic barriers to getting top surgery when you aren’t trans masc.
Yeah I've just noticed in general, on the broader trans subs of reddit there isn't much non-binary rep. Sometimes I've felt that I'm not ""trans enough"" because while I'm non-binary, I'm comfortable presenting feminine and I feel like being ""trans"" is often defined by a person's alignment with ""the opposite sex"". 

Solidarity, fren.
I hope this gives you some euphoria. They are Nonbianary and very Feminine all the time but none the less i have never seen them as anything but Nonbianary

there’s this really weird sentiment that trans people must be transitioning to “the opposite” and there’s very little space for gender-fuckery. Like I’ve heard so many people who were afab say they started medical transition (testosterone) so they could be more feminine. It also erases transneutral people when we make the new binary of transmasc and transfem. It seems like most people are incapable of expanding their view on gender beyond a binary and it’s… really frustrating. It’s called “NONbinary” for a reason. Like I don’t ID as transmasc despite being a genderqueer trans man because I’m not transitioning with the goal of being more masculine. Sure to the public eye that’s what’s happening. But I needed T for medical reasons and was forced to roll with the changes. I’m not masculine or butch or any of that. I am the fruitiest gay and femininity is really important to my sense of self. Calling me “transmasc” erases any of my complex relationship to femininity. There’s more to life and gender than masc vs fem on an exclusive binary. And what about those who are multigender? …sorry this is a bit of a ramble

edit to add: it’s so weird because on the flip side when I go on dating apps and put my gender as “nonbinary man” everyone jumps to the conclusion that I am a femboy who was amab. As if being feminine is the only way masculine-born people can be nonbinary. It’s weird as fuck. Like T has turned me into a hairy goblin. But anyone who sees nonbinary, whether they assume I was afab or amab, automatically decides I am a twink. please make it stop.
AFAB here and this pisses me off too. I believe the “androgyny” desire is based on the idea that the “male” body is seen as the NEUTRAL body. This has precedent in medical textbooks since their conception. 
Which pisses me off because why do my tits have to be sexualized to the point that even having them constitutes being more “womanly”?
I have what cis people consider to be a very feminine physicality and it’s taken me a long time to come around to loving my body as it is and now that I do I don’t want to change a thing about it (no shade to those who do) I’m just saying that, as someone who doesn’t believe in gender, why should my body have to be gendered in the first place? To me, it doesn’t take away from the fact that I feel genderless most of the time. 
It’s only other people’s perception of me that ticks me off.
I’m sure I’m not making any sense because I’m hella sleep deprived but I hope some people out there feel me.
In general, I feel like we get lumped in with trans people a lot—which isn't inaccurate for some folks, but it's not every person who identifies as NB is a future/current trans person. I've been trying to find a local support group forever and haven't found one yet that doesn't just lump NB under the trans label. When I've tried some that involves everyone together, it feels like I'm intruding—even though half the group is NB.
I'm afab non-binary, and I feel this so much. My presentation fluctuates. Some days I can't stand the idea of wearing something feminine. Most days I present femme bc I grew my hair out and wear makeup. The way I dress is often not feminine per se, but my body (wide hips, and tits) makeup and hair have me continually pegged only as femme. Makeup is art to me, and I got bored of my short hair with a fade after years of having the cut. I am far more ""masculine"" in both personality and skill set. (which I prefer to call my butch traits lol)

I don't like calling myself femme or masc necessarily but I don't want to present purely androgynous or get surgeries, or start T. So it always has me feeling unrepresented, and out of place in the community. 🫠
i’m literally the most feminine AFAB ever but like i’m not a woman, i’m enby
Some people really can't understand that transneutral, transandrogynous, and other options exist. I'm on T, but I'm still not transmasc
Thank you for bringing this discourse.
As an AMAB enby I fully agree too !
Transfem DID system here
31 transfems,
2 transmascs
1 androgynous
The 2 current fronters are Demi girl
But we many different flavors of transfem in our system
Also, yes we're intersex.
I agree with you! Afab here but i want really to get top surgery, maybe grow a moustache
Getting called a boy is a win for me!
Im afab nb, ive recently started referring to myself as transmasc. However i dont want full top surgery or a beard. I want a small chest, no facial hair and long head hair. Ill continue wearing clothes all over the decades and spectrum and keep my unshaved armpits/legs and scruffy brows. 

I consider myself transmasc because i want to look like a bishonen male. Think a long haired pretty boy. I also want to be buff as shit. But im still gonna be wearing my more femme stuff. I have no desire to look traditionally androgynous. I wanna be uncategorized in that regard. I will probably still get clocked as a woman even after I'm done with my hair growth and weight loss/exercise journey and thats ok. To myself im transmasc nb even if it looks abnormal to that description on the outside
Yes
I’m sick of telling people with NB it’s not one size fits all, not everyone who is NB uses they/them, not everyone is androgynous. I could never be androgynous with my body type anyway, but I’ve never dressed feminine in my life anyway.
My experience with nonbinary people IRL is that the NB stereotype of ""AFAB who leans towards male and gets TS and/or goes on T and uses they/them"" is actually very rare compare to how much representation that experience gets within nonbinary online spaces.
very true, us transfems enbies 4 dome reaspn don't get attention, but i want sttention cause ifk but GIMME ATTEMTION
Literally this was so hard for me as someone afab because I like wearing dresses? I like feeling pretty? But they/them feels best for me and I don’t think I am a woman.
I’ve had this feeling pop up a lot more recently bc I DO want top surgery and maybe a bit of testosterone (I’m intersex and was put on estrogen for 10+ years as a child and young adult bc my body wasn’t doing “normal girl things” and I kinda wanna balance that back out to what it would have been without) but I’m still not a dude. My top dysphoria mostly stems from severe sensory issues and that it is the thing people perceive first about me and automatically assume I’m a girl, even coworkers I constantly have to correct.. I’ve said many times I would be ok with any pronouns if I knew that it wouldn’t always only be she/her but considering all I get is she/her now when my pronouns are explicitly they/them in public.. yeah no. 
Trying to explain to people how I want to present is so hard bc I don’t relate a lot of my presentation to gender and I just want to have a flat chest so I can feel comfortable wearing pretty dresses.. if I ever told that to a therapist they would never give me my top surgery permission slip lmfao
This is also a huge source of dysphoria for me as an amab enby, cuz all I see in media is afab nonbinary representation and this makes me want to be afab so bad cuz I get the feeling I'm not being properly non binary and that I'm not in the right body
It's the opposite in any other general trans sub
I typically get ready as a trans girl, regardless of if people think I pass or not.  Kinda off topic, but in Texas it's probably also why I get ""sirred"" so much
I'm a AFAB,very femm and nb.  I hate the feeling of people not seeing me as nb but just as a girl with they/them pronouns:(
I'm a fem/Andros enby! We exist!!
I grew up witnessing such extreme toxic masculinity and femininity that I genuinly want nothing to do with either of them. When I see posts on this sub I see such a glorious range of gender expression and performance that it reminds me that the flaw isn't with the concept of gender, but with the toxic assholes I lived with. I love this sub for cleansing me of the bad energy I lived with for so long and reminding me that I love people!
i mean, it’s kind of invalidating to say “people who are afab but want to be masculine,” too. for many of us we are forced to present more masc than we like, to be taken seriously and gendered (occasionally) correctly. are you seriously excluded from non-binary spaces by afabs ? because i see a pretty even mix in this sub.
Enby transfemme here and thank for the representation 💖💖💖
There's nothing quite like cis people who tell queer folks ""you're not being queer right.""
I’m a transmasc enby who occasionally wears skirts and makeup. But I hate that ppl assume I’m fem presenting, because I don’t see it that way. I’m just wearing clothes and face paint, I’m not trying to be “fem”
 yeah, I’m genderfluid and I identify as genderless the majority of the time. I’m not transfem or transmasc.. I’m just genderless. I still experience dysphoria, I’m still non-binary, just not in the same way.
But like that sucks, really. Honestly I’m AFAB but like I don’t want to be assigned to a specific gender expression. I’m just me. And clothes are clothes. Shoes are just shoes. I wear what I feel comfortable in.
they’re trying to put us into a binary…
Agree, non-binary trans masc person.  
The world is shallow af and can't comprehend things non-binary.
Less online but irl I’ve noticed a lot of transmasc friends get misgendered they/them, were I’ve had people openly argue with me that I should be useing she/her rather than they/them

I really just don’t get it but it’s such a thing
Yeah I've noticed that too

I wonder why it happens?
We've seen that point discussed a lot and it seems that, actually, transmasc and transfem are equally represented (being binary or enby) but that most of us does not feel that way because of personal bias. For instance, as a transfem enby, I'm afraid that we take too much space and that fear makes me feel like there is not much transmac enby rep, which is quite the opposite of what you and OP describe.

Our community is not monolithic at all, and the way we see it hugely depends on where we live, our age, our personal story etc. and obviously our gender or lack of thereof. General statements about who is represented or not may give the false impression that our community is monolithic and that our experiences are the same.

Also, I'm afraid this false impression gives (wrong) arguments to enbyphobia: if we cannot overcome binarity within our very own community, enbyphobes will state this is because we cannot overcome binarity on a personal level. Both of these statements are false: transfem and transmasc are equally represented (even if personal bias makes it hard to witness) and binarity is a social construct that we've successfully left behind.
Sadly, so true.

All stereotypes are harmful. Each person is a different universe.
I have told some of my friends several times that I am trans non-binary and my pronouns are they/them or she/her. Still, after months (basically years for some), a certain set of people keeps conveniently forgetting I've ever come out, or like, publicly announced my pronouns, and I have to re-re-remind them that I do not, in fact, go by he/him anymore. And of course, I get sick of reliving that stupid conversation for people over, and over, and over, and over, and over again. So these people see me as a gay guy, or a fem-boy, if I'm lucky. I've even been on Estrogen for 9 months on this month. One of these people is my roommate and close friend of 9 years.
I *love* that society is gender stereotyping non binaries based off the binary. The Irony of it
That's exactly where I feel I am, I don't really want to be identified as either masculine or feminine by people, although I dress more masculine because I'm poor and restyling my closet is outside of the realm of possibility and my style sense
I also really hate the non-binary = skinny, white, androgyny shit. Like if that’s you, cool! But I don’t like the rest of society assuming that’s what we HAVE to look like. I’m not skinny nor androgynous and that really takes a toll on me when all the non-binary people I see aren’t like me.
Unfortunately it’s not just an idea, there is historical precedent:

Masculine names becoming feminine: Stacey, Vivian, Dylan, Elliot, Jules

Masculine clothing becoming feminine or gender neutral: High heels, tights, berets, trousers, blue jeans

Women woking in traditional masculine jobs

There aren’t many examples the other way around, and of the ones I can think of men tend to be hostile towards woman rather than embracing/accepting the idea of the thing they’ve adopted ever being feminine: Bronies, software engineers 

Some of it is explained not by gender so much as men being allowed to participate in society and women being forbidden from doing so. Or in other words, it’s not that feminine people want masculine work, or that the work was ever innately masculine to begin with, it’s just that those are the jobs that pay well.

“Why would you want to take the lesser position?” Isn’t a *wrong* idea it’s just the wrong question. The question should be *why are these traits and roles treated as lesser positions?*

And the answers is…

*opens a gold trimmed envelope*

…the fragile and toxic masculinity of the patriarchy! 

And the runner up… The patriarchy has held power for so long that their concepts are deeply embed in social norms and people respect a floral dress less than a three piece suit without even thinking about it

And the bronze medal goes to… A small group of men in control of major media sources who wield soft power to discredit and disempower anything not only takes power away from straight cis white men but also anything that even suggests that straight cis white men are a category of human rather than its normal form

However at a certain point it becomes a chicken or the egg argument
Yeah i feel this rly hard as a nonbinary person who is medically detransitioning. I feel like these ideals made me feel I had to prove I fit in the binary by transitioning medically. (Especially as a teenager without big oicture perspective.) I don’t regret my whole medical transition, but I do regret some of the medical decisions I can’t take back. I wish medically transitioning was seen more as a personal decision instead of something people who don’t fit gender roles *should* do.
People like rules
I've noticed this too that i feel like cis allies treat nonbinary as a third gender. Assuming they/them pronouns, assuming they're aiming for androgyny, stuff like that. It's getting really frustrating.
Yeah, I dont mind being called a femboy (mostly) and I even feel like its a good description for how im feeling sometimes. But usually its on some “femboy” spectrum I feel like and I get really uncomfortable when someone views me as *only* a femboy or puts me in a box. 

And some days I just feel so uncomfortable having to live up to societal expectations and I get really sad when I think that the only way for people to view me as queer or NB is to wear nail polish (which I love) or skirts (which I also love) but I just dont feel like it sometimes. 

And so if im not doing those things im just an average skinny white boy that’s probably smart and awkward because they have glasses and ugh. Even typing that out makes me feel so frustrated.
Yay! This is me too and I have such a hard time articulating it! It was hard figuring it out for myself, let alone others. But when I came out to my partner his response was ""you just want to be seen as nim. Thats who you are. I love your brain above anything else"" He nailed it! 😭

Also grunge aesthetic is the most fun to play with imo
Same. Im AFAB and present ultra femme. I always have acrylic painted nails, tons of makeup and jewelry, and long dyed hair. I put tons of effort into looking femme because that’s what I like. Because of all this I find that never I fully blame people for always calling me she/her but at the same time I did come out *multiple* times as nonbinary (they/them). There are some who have never called me by my preferred pronouns despite correcting every time. Im so frustrated that everyone who knows me well (not random strangers because obviously they’d use she/her) put no effort into practicing. It’s disrespectful.
I'm so happy to see this comment rn! I've been struggling with my gender identity for a while (again haha) and I've been leaning into the nb direction but I'm AFAB and enjoy feminine things (I've been wearing more skirts lately, wearing makeup and jewelry) and I feel guilty about it (stupid I know). I never allowed myself to be feminine when I was a kid bc it made me uncomfortable but now that I'm at least trying to figure out my gender I feel like I want to embrace femininity in my own kind of way, but all of the AFAB enbys I see (online, don't know anyone irl) are more masc and it makes me feel like an imposter I guess...
You do belong tho. <3
Same, wonder if it’s a regional thing
i feel this on a spiritual level
""my gender is like something you'd get at costco. Like it's clearly 'girl', but there's definitely something off about it.""

-- Some comedian I can't remember

But more sincerely: pronouns complement your gender, they don't define it! Once again for the people in the back: 

PRONOUNS COMPLEMENT YOUR GENDER, THEY DON'T DEFINE IT!
>like it's so difficult lol

I totally get it. Most of the time I don't feel ""female,"" but I'm not a man. I don't feel like I'm a ""tom boy"" or ""butch"" either. I actually would be happy as a clam to embrace androgyny most of the time...aside from the 1-3 times a year I feel female.
Very much same to all this!
I need to read this book!
I feel seen
This is what I’m talking about. The assumptions drive me crazy
You are non-binary enough 💙
Thanks for this! What a great performance!
That’s really gross how people treat you on dating apps. I’ve seen people say they want to become more physically masculine so they can wear feminine clothes and I thought I understood the sentiment, but now I’m not sure. 

If I’m feeling feminine, I wear feminine things and yeah, people will gender me was a girl, but that’s not my fault. I can understand wanting that “boy in a dress” look, even though it’s not for me, but I don’t like how it implies that femininity can’t be non-binary if it’s on AFAB people who don’t transition medically.
I feel this SO HARD. I’m currently in the medical field and so many things that apply to male and female bodies. We are more alike than we are different!!! People are always talking about men’s tits! Women with strong arms!!! Men with full lips and long hair!!! Hello????

I stan your sleep deprived ramblings.
That’s exactly how I think of it. My butch traits. I’m a lesbian, so my relationship to “womanhood” has always been complicated because femininity and womanhood is so tangled up in hetero patriarchy. 

I have a desire to be taken cared of like anyone else, but I feel so strongly attached to the role of the typical “man”. That doesn’t mean I want to look like a man OR a woman. And I think it’s also harming cis people who don’t feel connected to their gender roles but aren’t trans. 

I could go on, but I really appreciate this
I appreciate this. AFAB + Fem does not equal girl.
I said at the bottom of this post that this sub is the exception
People are weird fr. I'm not transmasc but I use he/they pronouns, mostly he, and something similar happened to me. Not irl but buying something on ig where I have my face in my pfp. I clearly talked about myself in masculine to kinda state my pronouns and the girl went all the time with girly girl woman but then another time when I talked in gender neutral pronouns she respected it. It's like they will respect they/them pronouns but not others?
ah yes, your close friend of 9 YEARS ""conveniently"" forgot you don't use he/him.
People often think men is the default and woman sexy extra. It is a sexist stereotype from a vis het dominated society.

The gay part is especially annoying, Since I am ""no-men"" too. (Emby preferable). Why must everything about men?  🙄
Oh wow that sucks but I feel you. Sometimes because I look “normal” I feel like people just slip back into what they are comfortable with. Luckily I have had some good friends and I’m not shy about reminding people, but it still hurts ya know?
Those friends are bad friends. It's about effort and intention, and they're either intentionally forgetting or putting in zero effort to even try. You deserve people in your life who respect you.
I’m not white or afab and a bit to muscular for the skinny category
This is my biggest issue with binders. Please don't show me an ad for a skinny white person in a binder and tell me that it works. Yes, ofc it does...there's barely anything there to begin with! Sorry, this is off-topic haha, just a little rant.
So, basically i'm an amab transfem that got followed around, called at, stared at and such.

And this is because people can't accept a men becoming more feminine. 

But i assure you, women do this too. It could be called patriarchy, but it's not fed by men only. It's fed by some women too.

I literally saw some women telling amab nb or transfem that they are ridiculous and that they should be strong and such. I agree with you, but only if we bring some women in the equation too.
My favorite example of a job going the other way around, from traditionally feminine to traditionally masculine is programming. The history of programming comes from mathematics, and mathematics had been using women to do the tedious calculations for years and years and years. So when early programmers needed someone to do the tedious work of producing assembly or even pure bit code, they used the same community of women.

Eventually it became obvious that the grunt work was actually extremely valuable work. Businesses started to hinge on the quality of the actual code, not the idea behind the code. Each major computing region had different responses to this sudden realization. The UK straight up fired all the women and had men try and pick up the work from scratch. The US had women teach their work to the men who would replace them. Both methods set the progress of computing back, but the UK method set them back so far that they utterly destroyed the lead they got from the WW2 code breaking research. This allowed the US Silicon Valley to take the lead in innovation.

The nitty gritty details are absolutely fascinating.
Yeah, societal pressure has really hurt the non-binary community. I’m sorry that you were pressured into a full medical transition when it wasn’t right for you, I hope you’re doing better now.
I feel like an imposter sometimes too. It’s why I kept she/her (it doesn’t bother me anyway and it’s less explaining to do to people who don’t need to know). All I know is I’m annoyed at being seen as a woman but also my apparent cisness means I do live life experientially as a woman. And I’m not bothered enough about my body for surgery or anything so it’s really just an internal acceptance that I’m agender. It’s frustrating and always has been because people treat me like “a girl” and I don’t like anything that comes with that aspect.
Hell yeah! We’re making a club now
Hugs 💜
🥰 Nonbianary people are valid in ANY way you want to be
yeah exactly!!! medical transition isn’t for everyone. Wearing girl clothes when you’re masculine and boy clothes when you’re feminine should not be the only way to be nonbinary. But it’s not “valid” unless you’re aiming for androgyny which is incredibly weird and leans into the whole “nonbinary is simply woman-lite” sentiment that so many hold.
 Because they’ve realized they already use they/them for binary and cis people so it isn’t as much of a ‘challenge’
Hah, yeah... Tbh I've been a little worried about where his heart lies politically lately. He spends most of his time with his Fox News-watching dad and playing online games with his two Republican friends from highschool, one of whom rehashes the same stupid racist/sexist/homophobic jokes he was making 10 years ago. Furthermore, despite many in-depth conversations I've had with him over the years, my roommate seems to be regurgitating a lot of red-scare style ""jokes"" about how capitalism is the only thing that works. The other night he was saying how episode 3 of The Last Of Us is probably his favorite onscreen representation of a gay couple, because ""they don't wave it in your face"" and it's ""just a normal couple."" Which like, don't get me wrong, I largely agree in some ways, and I fuckin cried for the last third of that episode it was so beautiful. But in tandem with the other red flags, it leaves a really bad taste in my mouth to hear this particular friend say that. He also said how ""even my dad loves it, which is saying something."" Like okay, so when the gays and the femmes aren't around, your dad is a homophobe? Wow, I'm really won over.

He also has become a very heavy drinker in the last couple years, and I've noticed it's started impacting his memory. Sometimes he repeats things he's already told me in the same day, and I guess in a weird defense of him ""forgetting"" my pronouns or that I had multiple conversations with him explaining my pronouns for him, he doesn't really seem very mentally present these days. But that just makes me worry more, for both his health and his ability intelligently engage with sociopolitical rhetoric.
Half indigenous, skinny (not because it's healthy, but because of our DID + ADHD we tend to forget to eat) we're too skinny to fit the mold. and our androgyny mostly comes from our voice. SO ppl assumes that we're a girl.
My issue is I’m like 6ft athletic fit broad shouldered but small waisted and I have a deceiving chest. It looks smaller because my shoulders. Binders aren’t made for my ratios so either they’re tight in the shoulders to flatten my chest and meet my torso or they fit my shoulders and loose on chest and torso. Tank ones never have the right length either. And I can’t tape because I’m allergic to adhesive. 🤦
Oh 100% yes the Partiarchy is also enforced and kept up by many, many women.   
Patriarchy =/= Actions of only the male parts of Society. That is not the definition of Partiarchy at all :)
Thank you! I have been off hormones for over a year now and I’m feeling much more at peace with myself.
I've always been a girl in society's eyes so I'm used to being treated as such and I definitely prefer that over being seen as a man. That's why I go by she/they (we don't have a widely recognized gender neutral pronoun in German so that's why it's still just technically she/her). I do sadly sometimes struggle with my body but it's luckily not constant and I can mostly ignore my anger towards it when it happens. I just wish I didn't feel like I have to proof my non-cis-ness to claim the nb label
I believe in you 💙
In my case is different since I speak Spanish but if I interpreted correctly what you meant it feels like the reason why she respected my pronouns when I used they but not he would be the same reason applied for english they/them.  

Like if using gender neutral pronouns is not as big of a challenge as using the complete opposite pronouns right?  As if they don't see they/them as ""that trans"" on their eyes so they don't mind they/them but won't use what they see as the complete opposite of the agab's person, that makes it too real and seems to make it more difficult for them.
Im sorry :( I know the feeling of trying to explain something so important to you, but the other person just doesn't listen/understand so it's like talking to a brick wall. It also sucks seeing someone you care about struggling/not listening to anything you say. No one deserves to be misgendered, and it hurts even more when it's by someone you care about.
Oh boy sounds real fun
This. The Patriarchy empowers men but that doesn’t mean men are the only ones who perpetuate its values
True, but i pointed out that's not the ""fragile and toxic masculinity"" or a ""small group of men in control"" only. It's also how some women conceptualize femininity and how the act toward trans women.

I like to point this out because i don't like to see a complex discourse reduced to toxic masculinity, when there is much more involved 😁
Glad to hear that :).
Yes exactly

In fact, some of the loudest voices against women's suffrage in the US were women.
Yes, TERFs can go fuck themselves
It was sarcastic.
Sadly it's not only terfs 🥲

afab and new as shit to my gender identity		"I'm in this and I don't like it
how dare you. this is correct
Yup. I am in this photo.
(*looks at green button up I'm wearing*) 
Excuses me, how so very dare you.
Also, wearing button ups *under* things.
Current favorite combo: button up under overalls.
Enjoy ;)
Omg I relate to this so hard
😳
Welcome to the club. I only just figured out I'm genderfluid last year.
Lol bless you. You’ll get there!! I remember doing this too.
I'm so called out
I wear button ups to present more feminine.
Also AFAB. I just wear flannel shirts and I’m done with everything. My friends are starting to make fun of the fact that I basically have a flannel shirt for everyday and I don’t intend to change
Same!
This is literally me, how dare you!
Oh god that’s me
Damnit. This is too accurate, lol.
...Not quite.
i hope so!!
*looks at the grey and black plaid button up im wearing*

....I can't even be indignant.
Help 😭
\*looks at black button up\* am I really this transparent?
Hey, you can present however you want.

When I first came out, I had this odd but not-exactly-rare complex that I had to look like A Non-Binary Person ^tm . Part of that is AFAB dysphoria, but most of it is that that’s what androgyny looks like in the media.

Now? Well, K still like short hair and button-ups, but I ADORE skirts and makeup... things I avoided even while closeted, because of a vague sense of “this isn’t what an androgynous person looks like.”

So, in summary, dress however the fuck you want. They’re gonna give you hell for it no matter what you do, so you might as well do what you want.
This is what I always find funny. Anyone who falls under the non-binary umbrella is always told how they don’t fit this idea of androgyny that people expect 

Literally, I say I don’t conform to your gender stereotypes, and the first thing I get told is that I don’t fit their stereotype of my gender. You don’t owe anyone androgyny, you don’t owe anyone the depiction of your gender in the way they expect it to be. You do you, and that’s the best way to express yourself, by staying honest to yourself. There are no set clothes for a non-binary person, there’s no set way you need to act, theres no things that you have to do to fit into a gender, there’s nothing you need to prove to anyone."	fchci8	NonBinary	964	1.0	2020-03-02 19:22:55

Seriously, non-binary reddit has the best shirts
Enbies and our love of button ups with wild prints. I fucking love that shirt, great look all around

I love that shirt. It's awesome. I need 10 in every color possible.
Shits with lil buttons make me feel so euphoric for some reason.
Ugh I need it, I am on a wild search for as many crazy printed shirts as I can find and I love this! You look so cute, that hair is amazing!!!
As a wildlife nerd, I love how even your tattoo is nature themed
Nice! I gave my roommate the same awesome haircut!!!
You look nice! 😊😁
dad shirts are the best shirts
I LOVE IT SO MUCH YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN THAT
What a vibe
I’ve got the dad jokes!
I LOVE your hair
I felt that
I love your mask, did you make it? Also you look rad and your tattoo is super cool, I don't think I've seen a design have something like your deer before, where the ink surrounds it and the deer is your skin color (I'm describing this terribly lol). But it's awesome looking.
Ayyyy another side shave, poofy hair, non-binary folk in a dad shirt!! Love this look!
Omg that’s such a gorgeous shirt!!!
This is the best vibe 😍
Aw, no, thank you! :D
It so does! I get so happy seeing all the wild designs and prints!
Thank you! :)
Thank you! :D
Thank you! Nature, and especially forests, are where I feel most at home. So I wanted a bit of nature that I could take with me everywhere :)
THANK YOU :)
Dad jokes are the best! :D
Thank you! I grew it myself :D
I bought it actually (because the print called out to me, lol). Thank you! My tattoo artist did such a great job with that one! :)
Hell yes! Thank you!
Thank you! :D
Ofc!! And where did you get this shirt? The longer I look at it the more convinced I am that I need to own it
I got it at a sale on a website (zalando, don't know if that is a available everywhere?). The brand is only & sons :)"	hk1ivq	NonBinary	942	1.0	2020-07-02 17:39:12
I think I might be trans non binary but my girlfriend is a radfem: an update!	"Hey! I'm the same person who wrote about questioning their gender and thinking about continue transition while having an openly radfem girlfriend. I have some news that I wanted to share with yall!

First, this week I went to a transgender clinic with a non binary friend. I felt really comfortable, my friend was even surprised! They said I looked so happy while talking about transitioning and that I'm definitely not cis. I agree, while talking about how I feel and my desires I realized I certainly have a more similar experience of what being trans is rather than being cis. However, I still don't feel worthy of calling myself trans or non binary. 

I also talked to my mom about my dysphoria, and gave some ""discreet hints"" about not being cis and she was very okay about it! She was only confused why my dysphoria is back, but I'm feeling the same lol, so no worries. But I'm don't feel safe yet to talk about medical transition, I'll wait until I'm more comfortable and sure about my identity.

Second: yes, I broke up with my (now ex) girlfriend. It was a respectful conversation, where both sides were heard. My questioning wasn't the only thing that made me want to break up, she did some little things that made me upset during our relationship that didn't get better. She also have some personal issues she's working through that were also impacting our relationship. 

During the conversation, I said she didn't treat trans people with decency and that she, from my perception, have a very simplistic idea of what being trans and dysphoric is, and due to that I was afraid of talking about my situation with her. She said that it wouldn't matter if I identify as any label of trans, that ""she even has a non binary friend"", she would still love me and treat me with respect, but she would still see me as a woman. She also said that the not so good thing she calls trans people are only ""jokes"" but she wouldn't misgender them or anything (even tho she still does that). After breaking up, I felt relieved! I'm exited to discover myself again and meet new people!"	"Congrats 🎉 amazing update it sounds like things are going well and you’re in a good position to grow, explore, and take care of yourself as a unique and special person. I’m so happy for you💜🌈
Congratulations and good luck moving forward
No radfems. Only rad femmes
Oh thank god I’m soo glad you broke it off.
Aww I remember that post. What a fucking victory. Love to see it 🥲
your ex was a little dick. i hope the rest of your journey is much better! my one piece of advice is to take shit from no one
Thank GOD for this update! My friend, I was genuinely worried about you, and now I’m seeing this?! You got yourself to a point where you went to talk about this openly, and felt okay with that. That’s a huge step. I know after my first appointment with a gender specialist i felt a lot more at ease. More accepting of myself and what I may want in the future. 

Medically transitioning isn’t necessary but for a lot of us it’s the only option to get piece of mind in our bodies. I’m currently weighing up the pros and cons of top surgery, it’s a big thing for me, and it’s okay to take the time to consider all the options you have, or don’t have. 

I’m really happy you got out of that relationship, because telling a person “I’ll support you but I won’t ever believe you or accept you as yourself” is NOT supportive or kind or okay. That’s the opposite of support. If it were true, they wouldn’t have  said “but I’ll see you as a woman”. I’m sorry that they couldn’t even for a second out aside their own bullshit for you. Because you sound really cool and super nice, it’s their loss completely. 

So go and thrive, it’s the best way to live your life. We don’t get given a whole lot of time, never waste a minute on doubting yourself or who you are.
Go fucking get it, you absolute monarch 🏳️‍⚧️❤️💜
Can we normalize not affirming TERFs as feminists? They are not feminists. They are transphobes who weaponize feminist ideas to focus their hate.
💖💖💖
Congratulations 🥳 Hope your self-love journey w/your new identity goes well! 

Came out as Nonbinary back in May 2021. 💖
She wouldn't do anything disrespectful yet would still see you as a woman.. lmao good thing that's over
Wooooo boy! I can't tell you how excited I am reading this. I didn't even read the other original post you made, and I don't know you at all, but I'm proud of you! These are huge moves towards self actualization, way to go.
Good job!  I'm proud of you!

(Although, I do wish people wouldn't use radfem a short hand for terf - it's a specific branch of feminism that can also be trans-inclusive. And most terfs aren't even real feminists, let alone radical ones).
So glad for you! And so good you broke up with someone like that: if she doesn’t see you as who you are, that’s not respect. There are plenty of other ppl who will actually respect you.
😄🎉
wow your ex is just yikes
>she would still love me and treat me with respect, but she would still see me as a woman.

tf? This is absolutely NOT treating a non-binary/trans person with respect. 🤬

If you are enby/trans, you are not your AGAB and don't want to be treated like it 😠
❤️❤️❤️
I’ve been waiting for this update! Live your best life and know that you’re valuable and wonderful.
Congratulations!!! We’re proud of you ♥️ keep going! You got this
So so happy for you
💜💜💜
Im so happy for you. I hope the rest of your journey goes well.
i don't think i saw your first post so i'm not familiar with your story but i'm so glad to hear you're feeling better and making awesome progress on your gender journey! happy for you 🥰
Waah, I'm happy for you! <3 I feel like you know this, even if your ex gf and society tried to surpess it; you are totally worthy of calling yourself nb and trans, say it with me ""I'm worthy and valid"".
Amazing update!! Congratulations and I'm wishing you the best of luck and all the happiness with everything in your future😊
Youre doing amazing! Im proud of you! 

And dont worry about calling yourself non binary.
If it feels comfortable for decribing yourself go for it!
Both terms are umbrella terms that cover a great deal of different experiences! Non binary is simply not always fully feeling like your agab. Whether that is genderfluid, demi, a-gender etc.
Congrats! Sounds like you have already made huge steps in your journey! Never forget you have a whole community here to support you! 🏳️‍⚧️💕
Happy to hear you are doing better and have people who support you.

I am kinda questioning if I trans too but have not yet gone to talk to a mental health professional about this because I have not found a person who is openly LGBTQ supportive. Like gender dysphoria is still labeled as *mental illness* in my country.
Thank your for the update! I’m so happy to hear that things are looking up for you. I’m very happy that you’re able to stretch your wings and grow into yourself.
Keep being an amazing human being!
Radical Feminism isn't inherently transphobic, it is merely the belief that social restructuring as well as political laws are necessary to achieve feminism.
Quotas, the debate on the male gaze, the fight against gender norms and roles are all parts of radical feminism.
TERFs misinterpret radical feminism to their liking despite many radical feminist authors being trans-inclusive, please don't let them take away this tradition from actual real feminists.
And I'm glad you got red of her, she seems toxic asf.
YAY! So glad to hear you're doing better :)
I am very proud of you! It can be incredibly hard to leave the ones we love in order to move forward comfortably in our lives. I wish you happiness :)
Congratulations 🎉 and proud to read the edit 😊
I'm glad for you, cousin. I wish peace and happiness for you. That took courage and strength to get through. Be proud.
Hi, I commented on that post! So glad to hear you're in a better place now. I wish you the best on your gender journey ❤️
I didn’t see the original post but good on you for being able to break things off! Here’s to hoping your journey is a great one! 👍
 good thing u broke up with her
Good job taking this step for yourself. Proud of you.
You have earned this massive W. I admire your agency and taking control of your life. I wish nothing but blessings for you from here on out💖

Remember to love yourself, monarch🌺
🙌🏻
I love the double meaning here. Not only is monarch a nonbinary term for royalty but also a type of butterfly which is appropriate as well.

Idk why I'm tickled so much by this, but I am.

ninja edit: also, sorry if I'm being lame for literally explaining the joke, but it is too good for people to just scroll past.
I apologize for that. I thought radfem and terf were synonyms. But yes, my ex is trans exclusionary. I didn't want to date someone who say really bad things about people like me and make me feel unsafe to talk about my situation.
Agreed about radfem vs TERF. There *are* radical feminists who are trans-inclusive, and I worry that we run the risk of alienating them if we say radfem when referring to the TERFy ones.
unrelated but i love that DF avatar
You're right and you should say it. Radical feminism is a very cool thing that was co-opted by very hateful people
Not sure why you are getting downvotes for effectively saying the same thing I got upvoted for. Trans-inclusive radical feminists do exist, and not just in a soggy toast “well, I’m inclusive by not being exclusive” way. Many radical feminist ideas have contributed to our society(ies) becoming more accepting of gender binary non-conformity in the past several decades. Let’s not throw out the allies with the shitwater!
Oh it was GREAT for you to explain it, because I didn’t even know what I did there
I bet they've never read any actual radfem theory either, most theorists were hella pro trans.

And if they've read any, it's probably the idiots that wrote transsexual empire and the other idiots that started political lesbianism.

*vent* someone on r/trans said I'm not trans???	"If not allowed pls delete BUT

Self ID: they/them afab, 23, white American

I posted a couple selfies in r/trans asking for funky name suggestions for me and everyone for the most part has been really kind and helpful! 

But someone commented saying 

""if you're AFAB fem leaning, and present as female, why do you use the label transgender when the only thing different from your AGAB is your identity? 

I don't want to gatekeep but as a trans person who has had to face hell for being myself, it just feels demeaning""

Like??? Sorry I'm not androgynous enough for you?? Fuck off??? I'm just feeling put out 😞"	"I stopped going to that sub because when I asked a question related to going from IDing as a trans guy to IDing as solely nonbinary, I was immediately referred to a subreddit for detransitioners, despite still very much being trans! My question wasn’t me asking whether I was valid or asking for opinions on my identity. It was shockingly exclusionary.
As an AMAB who is more masc presenting and has gotten the same comments, I hear you :,) it’s not fair for them to question your identity like that. But remember, that’s what it is: **your** identity. They might try to deny you your identity, but they can’t take it away from you. Only you know your own truth.
You’re trans. You still socially transition by changing your identity no matter how much you change physically 

Naturally certain trans people will be more likely face more/worse discrimination than others. But discrimination is not what constitutes transness. If it did then if we lived in the world we all want, where we would be fully accepted, would none of be trans anymore? No of course not. This individual is just projecting an insecurity. Yes androgynous and physically transitioning trans people are more likely to be met with vitriol and be systematically oppressed, but that is not what makes us trans. And all trans people will face challenges. LGBT community is not for playing oppression olympics it is for support and acceptance
Yeah, some binary trans people gatekeep us nonbinary people as not trans enough. But of course nonbinary people are included within the trans umbrella, that’s what the white stripe in the flag is for 🏳️‍⚧️. 

There also exist “truscum”, who are trans people who think it only counts if you have some sort of medical intervention. They also exclude binary trans people if they can’t get surgery/HRT.
I like the transgender umbrella term. I am fairly fluid in my gender and sometimes I feel binary male or binary female or agender or some mix of all. I guess I can understand how some people could be upset that the integrity of their identity is being corroded. But I like the transgender community and feel like I can be comfortable there for the most part. 

I know everyone’s experience is different, but we all transitioned our gender outside our AGAB. For some the changes were catastrophic, and for others like myself it has been mostly internal. I think both experiences are valid. I don’t intend to make little of people that suffered, I just don’t think it’s a defining part of being transgender.

My nephew (AFAB) is 16 and I love that my sister accepted his desire to transition and seeks to support him as best as possible. Even my 77 year old mom is careful to never use his deadname. I think he is extremely valid as transgender, even though he never experienced adversity from his family or peers. Being transgender shouldn’t have to be hell for anyone.

My thinking is I didn’t become transgender to be controversial. I became transgender, because being cisgender was crushing my soul.
To me “why do you identify as trans if the only thing different is your identity” comes across similar to “why do you identify as bi when youre in a hetero relationship” - people acting like because youre not currently “as oppressed” as them or whatever youre not part of the community. I think i get where theyre coming from - often people like that see being trans as something that causes them to be discriminated against, and they get upset because to them it seems like you are “choosing” something that was forced on them, as in you could choose to be seen as cis or not, while they dont have that option. Its a very flawed mindset and helps absolutely no one, its close to saying “you couldve stayed in the closet”. The way i see it, the more variation we accept within the trans and nonbinary community, the better we can all support each other. As soon as people start drawing lines between who is and isnt “trans enough”, we start excluding people who need the community support and we’re all a little worse off.
Gatekeeping crap. Don’t let it upset you x
As an enby who identifies with the trans flag \*and\* the nonbinary flag, you do not owe *anyone* visible androgyny. You do not need to look a certain way to be nonbinary and trans. you do not need to dress a certain way to be nonbinary and trans. you don't even need to change your pronouns fully to be nonbinary and trans. 

&#x200B;

You are Trans. You are Nonbinary. That person is just being rude and likely projecting their own issues onto you.
I checked out the post. Thankfully their comment has been removed by mods after being downvoted and you’ve been backed up by numerous other trans folk. I know the initial part stings but the trans community as a whole seems to be on your side in that sub
I social transitioned within my friend group and some of my family, but safety reasons have me where I am not out to my partners family and some of my own. I’m nonbinary. I’m trans. No one can tell you at all what you are or your true feelings with your gender and your identity as a whole. No one. I’m so sorry this happened to you. You’re trans. Your identity and your presentation are two completely separate things. I know trans men that don’t want to change their bodies at all, they are still men. And vice versa. No one else has any right to identify you for you. So kindly tell them to go eat rocks and don’t let them stress you out. They don’t deserve that power. I’m so proud of you for venting and asking for support. That’s extremely hard to do sometimes. Keep your head up and be your favorite self. 💚
Trans people don't owe anyone any ""masculinity/femininity/androgyny"". Identify however makes you feel comfortable in your skin. And dress/present yourself how you please. Ignore these negative people. I know its hard.. but more people are on your side than you know.
“I don’t want to gatekeep but” *proceeds to gatekeep*

**Your identity is not demeaning** and if someone finds if that way, that’s a them problem, not a you problem. 

I’m also AFAB, fem-leaning, and “present as female”. I don’t give a shit. I don’t have to look or act a certain way in order to be trans enough for anyone. My existence doesn’t invalidate the existence of trans people with different experiences. There is no single trans experience and I’m tired of people trying to say there is.
>the only thing different from your AGAB is your identity

But that IS what being trans is, and its definition is independent from how you present, act, your interests and everything else. You are totally valid, and that person is a dumbass.
I present as female because I can’t afford to present as anything else lmao. What an ignorant thing to say. (And even if you can afford to but choose not to, you’re still trans, but I feel like there are a lot of common reasons to still present as your AGAB)
Don’t lestion to them. Their just gatekeeping it’s not nice. Use what ever label you want to.
It’s not the oppression olympics smh. They were ridiculous for that. 

If it was the oppression olympics, you’d get points because invalidating someone else’s identity is gatekeeping and oppressing them. :)
Babe when people like that open their mouths, just remember that you are 100% valid no matter what, and they can suck it. Your gender identity, sex assigned at birth, gender expression, and everything else could be wildly different or align perfectly. It’s for you, no one else. 

I highly recommend asking yourself “hey who pissed in this persons cheerios” in these situations. More often than not it makes you laugh, while also reminding you that people put others down because they’re hurting themselves and can’t be bothered to face their own shit. 

Keep going. You got this. <3
""I don't want to gatekeep but as a trans person who has had to face hell for being myself, it just feels demeaning"" 

I thought this was your response to this person. It's ironic that in saying this, they are actively doing the thing that they are complaining about. As a trans person who has had to face hell for being myself, enbyphobia is transphobia, and by being enbyphobic, your doing the very thing that you use as an excuse to exclude others.
Whoever said that is a dumbass, simply put. Nonbinary actually fits under the definition of transgender - they're just trying to play gatekeeper.
Trans ftm lurker here(find the sub useful in learning about the nonbinary members of the Trans community) It doesn't matter what some Internet rando says. all the community asks you do is stop listening to the haters and be true to who you are!!
i'm in the same boat here. i just like wearing pretty dresses dammit. nonbinary people don't owe you androgyny!!!
You're definitely trans, they're just being dumb.
the mentality of that reply is so fucking disgusting

trans means not cis, that's it

idk why ppl wanna turn it into a competition of who's """"""trans enough""""""
you're trans enough. They're just a bitter POS.
Ugh I hate gatekeepers and truscums/terfs
True scum/trans meds. They love to gatekeep transness as if the gender binary isn't fake and as if you're required to be masc if you're AFAB and femme if you're AMAB. Just ignore them, they're upset that the community is growing and progressing.
Uhm. So, paraphrasing that first section a bit, but they said to you ""your agab and identity are different"" and also said you're not trans? 😵😵
I'm sorry but is that not kinda what makes us trans? 😅 big oooof don't listen to those people... I'd like to think the majority of us are on your side here 💚
I'm sad they deleted the comment I wanted to go off on them. You're whatever you say you are dear, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
Gatekeepers suck. You're trans if you identify as trans. There's no checklist or requirement other than that.
i've always been in the mindset that non binary is under the trans umbrella it's unfortunate not all think the same. i've had similar hate for same im non binary and trans despite that's what i am
They sound like they think they are the god of everything trans & Enby. They would like a ridiculous power tripping Asshole. 
Looks and styles don’t denote how trans you are or how non binary you are.  
Some people don’t have the money to do whatever they’d like to themselves looks wise. So some just have to be ok with the body they have yet know and feel they are trans/Enby.
Yeah that sort of gatekeeping is wrong, but also try not to let one shitheeel commenter ruin the other people's support.  There are good people like you and those people who were helping you, and that's what the trans community is about, not the occasional garbage brained person who thinks it's their place to invalidate you.

Instead, I recommend you report it as a violation of their rule 6, which includes ""No arguing with trans people about their identity."" 

Also can I just say, this community (r/nonbinary) rocks? Like I've seen this community get things right, again and again, and so many subreddits and lgbtq+ spaces online aren't really communities that care about people, even people who get things wrong, and this one feels like it is, and it's why I come here.
Theres so much in-fighting in the lgbtq+ community now, and im sick of it.
Welcome to the trans community.
I’m so so sorry you had that experience on r/trans. As a binary transwoman, you are 100% transgender. What everyone has been saying in these comments is true. Transgender is an umbrella term for anyone that no longer identifies with their agab. And also, the white strip in the trans flag is literally for non-binary/gender-fluid individuals. 

When dealing with trans people like this, especially if they are binary/transmed, don’t pay them any mind. Most likely, they feel insecure about the fact that they as a trans person have to transition medically. As a transwoman who is on hrt and is in constant fear that my access to gender affirming healthcare will be taken away by conservatives (forcing me to detransition), I sympathize with that insecurity. However, their insecurities should in no way invalidate the experiences of non-binary individuals or people who decide not to transition medically. There is no requirement or one way to be transgender. And in all honesty, those insecurities are miss placed, because it would be the non-binary and trans people who don’t want to transition medically that would be fighting right beside us for the right to gender affirming healthcare. We should be fighting against the bigotry of conservatives in our nation, not against the wonderful people in our own community. 

I’m so sorry you went through this and I promise you are trans enough. ❤️
I think within the trans community specifically, there’s a lot of pain that manifests as, “If X person does not feel the same pain as me, they are not worthy of saying we share experience/identity with me.” I see it a lot with transmedicalists specifically. They don’t see the irony that the same faulty “logic” is used to exclude trans people (almost always trans women) from “real” gender-hood. “You’re not a real woman if you didn’t grow up suffering for being female” type stuff. Within the trans community it comes from a place of deep hurt. That in no way excuses it though. It’s misdirected anger that should be pointed toward the system that harms all of us by rigidly policing identity expectations.
Someone once DM'ed me saying she was trans but she didn't believe in non binary and I was so confused 😂
Someone is keeping a gate
You are trans enough. <3
Well, you definitely don't seem like you're the one that's gatekeeping here. It's easy to hide behind anonymity when it comes to the internet. So it could be a disgruntled person or a terf just trying to make you feel bad.

Either way, you've got a good name to add to your block list and a whole lot of support. The words of one person aren't going to change who you are. And they have to live with themselves every day. So, don't join them in their miserable little world where no one else wants to join them.
Luckily it looks like a lot of people came to your defense. That kind of gatekeeping is just nasty. It’s sad that it comes from a place of pain but that’s no excuse. There’s just no good that comes from those comments, it makes things harder for people, not easier. I wish everyone could support and lift each other up. I think it’s evident that that commenter’s opinion is an unpopular one based on the responses and I do hope that makes you feel less discouraged.
Some trans people are transphobic and ignorant too. Being trans has always and will always be about affirming ones internal sence of identity. That's it really. Like, let people be themselves or fuck off.
Yeaaahhhh that’s why I don’t post on trans sub. I identify as Nonbinary myself. Promouns are she/they and I guess I dress neutral?!

Like I keep my hair in a bun 99% of the time cause I have trichotillomania.

Don’t wear makeup, ever.

Other than leggings and the 4 dresses I own, my bottoms & tops are very neutral overall. The only thing that gives away that I’m AFAB is my chest. The girls are HUGE (38F) and I love wearing tanks and camis. Oh and if I start singing (I’m a singer and a soprano so 🤣).
""if you're AFAB, and fem leaning, why are you using the term transgender when [definition of trans]?""

Sounds like someone doesn't like knowing that AGAB, gender identity, and gender expression are all different.
For all they could have known, you could have been genderfluid and feeling feminine that day.

I would have reported the comment, myself, but I'm more petty about trans discourse than others.
And I'm a feminine transmasc person.

Who am I, or anyone else, to judge the labels of other people?
You decide your labels (when you come across them) and why you feel you align with them.
You decide how you express yourself.
And you decide when, where, and if you want to share that with anyone else.
As a fellow AFAB fem-leaning fem-presenting enby, have a hug (if you're comfy with them). Interestingly enough, I've also had someone tell me that I *have* to identify as trans because my gender identity differs from my birth gender. People who police labels will never be happy, ID how you want.
Trans = ""does not identify with their assigned gender""

Therefore nonbinary = trans because you don't identify with your assigned gender. 

Trans is literally about identity and not about how a person looks. I have a friend who is a trans woman who can't be out for her own safety and actively lives as a man and uses he/him pronouns publically. That doesn't  make her any less trans than the next trans person.
>the only thing different from your AGAB is your identity

is this not literally the fucking definition of being trans????? like, yes, identity is different from assigned gender, the definition of what being trans is.

why do some trans people feel the need to push the transphobic gatekeeping?? it's useless and all it does is hurt trans people. being a jerk to other trans people isn't gonna make any transphobe hate you any less.
It's incredible how people struggle to separate gender identity and gender expression/presentation. 

Going from AGAB to psychologically, emotionally, spiritually accepting your gender identity is a transition. That is something internal and invisible but is absolutely trans. If they don't think it's ""trans enough"" they need to check themselves and see how erroneous that is. 

Your gender isn't what those present said it is at your birth. That means you're trans. It's that simple. Other people may do different things to manage dysphoria but that doesn't add to or take away from their or your trans-ness.
Don’t listen to the truscum.  There is no true Scotsman.
If they didn't want to gatekeep, they shouldn't have tried to. Trans identity is for anyone who identifies as trans, full stop. You belong under the umbrella if you want/need to be under it. There's room here for everyone.

""I suffered for my identity, so others not suffering as much as I did is an affront to me and an invalidation of their identity"" is not a valid argument. The goal is less suffering for trans folx, not more. More inclusion, not less.

You don't owe anyone /any/ type of gender performance,  not cis folks, nor your fellow trans peeps.

You are trans enough, period. You belong here if you want to belong.
""Why do you call yourself trans, when you would actually be cis if you weren't trans?"" Lmao. that person sounds like an idiot.
I’m so sorry you had to experience that :( everyone’s gender and the combination of identity and expression etc is different and unique. Some nonbinary people might not identify as trans, and that’s perfectly okay, and some will identify as trans, thus (and also overall) for someone to deny a nonbinary person’s identity is so disrespectful and sad to see within a trans community. 

Also, as a trans nonbinary person who is also afab myself, recently becoming more comfortable with my identity and gender has allowed me to find joy in some more traditionally feminine things related to appearance (ex jewelry) that I previously had issues with, and it’s such a lovely and freeing experience and I don’t see why someone should have to conform to some notion of gender to be accepted. And nonbinary is all about breaking the binary and societal molds and expectations too, so why should an afab person have to present more androgynously or masculine in order to be accepted as trans??
The thing about reading people as ""fem-presenting"" or ""masc-presenting"" is that often people will be read that way regardless if their efforts to appear otherwise. Few people actually look perfectly androgynous and they get judged for something they can't control. Also people who make comments like that have no idea whether people are or are not struggling with their presentation and it's a rubbish assumption to make about other trans people.

All that being said, it's also perfectly fine to present in a way that is assumed to be in line with your agab and be happy about it. The policing of presentation and identities is surreal.
>if you're AFAB fem leaning, and present as female, why do you use the label transgender when the only thing different from your AGAB is your identity?

The only thing that matters when identifying as trans is your identity. Your agab doesn't matter, your gender expression doesn't matter. People who say otherwise only enforce the binary that is very much not rooted in reality.

I've only recently come out as nonbinary exactly because I have felt like I was ""not trans enough"" because I'm amab, expierience little to no dysphoria and present masculine. I'm glad I did come out. I have binary trans friends with who have been very supportive of me. I know their expieriences have been vastly different and they have been met with a lot more resistance from the people surrounding them. We just need to be aware that being trans means something different for each individual and stop trying to create a third box to put people into.
Mtf transwoman here. Being non-binary is under the trans umbrella. We face many of the same issues, and we need to do our best to support each other, both as members of a similar coalition and also as people. You don’t owe anyone any specific type of gender presentation in order to be seen and respected as who you are. 

I’m sorry that this person tried to gate keep you. That was wrong of them. The fact that they referred you to a detransitioning subreddit is wild. It is them giving you the same type of treatment that is constantly complained about in trans spaces. This person is not representative of the trans community at large.
I feel kinda in the same boat, my roommate is a trans girl but sometimes doesn't recognize me as trans too. I pass a lot as cis, but inside is just another story. I default as void gender. 

I am but a meat suit, but I think it's hard for ppl to break from the gender norms of what they learned. For some ppl you're this or that, no gray area. But the gray area of gender is trans too. 

So keep on keeping on. Fuck gender roles, fuck this or that thinking.
You’re still trans even if you don’t transition to the opposite binary gender. There are lots of trans enbies and gatekeepers suck!
I think some of that can be chalked up to ignorance, but the bit near the end about them finding it demeaning is definitely rude
Some people try to gatekeep just about anything based on how much they had to suffer
Transitioning from Binary to Non-Binary can absolutely be called trans if the word feels right to you. You transitioned from one gender to another.
Your valid, I’m sorry some people suck
i'm sorry you had that experience. that sounds so upsetting and unfortunately there will ALWAYS be someone who will question you. ik it's easier said than done, but the most important thing is knowing that the only person you need validation from is yourself and that really helped me.
I think this happens cause a lot of people don't see gender as a spectrum, they see it as a lineal thing with boxes.
""Trans"" is an umbrella term, under the umbrella are all the ""I don't identify as what I was assigned at birth"" genders
> *when the only thing different from your AGAB is your identity*

Umm... Yes. That is the point it turns out. Everything beyond identity is performance of one kind or another. Who gives a fuck if the performance of two different-gendered people is arbitrarily similar? ...besides that guy I guess.
There are a few extremely rotten apples that feel that anything they don't consider trans is a major threat to the trans community as a whole, it's absolutely as ridiculous as it sounds. Pay them no mind, they're straight up wrong.
im willing to bet that person is truscum and therefore their opinion invalid and can be safely ignored!
Seriously, f*** that person. You're trans and you rock
🤢🤢🤢

You decide your labels. There is no such thing as ""trans enough"". Gatekeeping is GROSS.
We are all gender deviants. People who speak like that are just projecting issues of their own.

Like the commenter said- they have gone through hell-so obviously they think everyone else should too. >_>
""I dont want to gatekeep""

Then dont open your fucking mouth. It aint hard. God i cant fucking *stand* people like this, people that feel the need to dump their dysphoria onto others and police their identities and lives. Fuck that. 

Again, this is why i dont hang around general trans spaces. You get bombarded with this shit *ceaselessly.* Never have i felt more hated and picked apart and stamped out than in these groups.

I dont care if i sound vitriolic. Honestly I am. Im sick of this community kicking itself in the ass.
they will never be happy unless we all look like grey blobs lmao
Me being in line with the expectations of my AGAB at times has exactly nothing to do with how trans I am. People should also stop projecting their trauma onto strangers on the internet.
There are binary trans people who buy into idea that gnc and non-binary trans people somehow “hurt the cause” despite the fact that transphobes hate us all regardless.
Lots of bigots and chasers creep around. Report and block.
You don’t owe anyone a particular type of gender expression. You don’t have to “look” trans in order to be trans. Everyone has different experiences and yours is not uncommon and always welcomed here.
That's someone who's trying to deal with their own feelings and problems by trying to put them on you instead, they have some maturing to do
Im so sorry. This is exactly why I don’t tell many people that I’m nonbinary and just let people think I’m a woman.
Have had this happen myself as an AFAB enby a couple times. So weird to me how gatekeep-y some people are. 'Trans' to me has always meant you identify with something other than the gender you were assigned at birth. Yes, FtM or MtF trans people with really bad dysphoria who need to transition with hormones/surgery who have been horribly bullied for these things in a horribly transphobic society have different experiences than those who haven't gone thru that, but that doesn't make those who don't identify with their AGAB any less trans, if that's a label an nb person vibes with. You're valid OP

Edit: also wanted to add plenty of nb people do transition more than just socially too. There's nb people I know on hormones who are transmasc and wanted to feel more masculine than just wearing masculine clothes/cologne/etc. There's nb people who have had top/bottom surgery too who still identify as nb. To exclude nb people from the trans community is counterproductive and doesn't at all help MtF/FtM trans people in fighting for their rights. It just others nb people and gives off a 'we don't want you in our club cuz otherwise we'll have to let everyone in' sort of vibe.
""I don't want to gatekeep but I'm also an asshole.""
As a trans guy, they can fuck off as respectfully or disrespectfully as u want. Ur trans enough and don't forget it
if you identify as anything other than your AGAB youre trans thats like saying someone pre transition isnt trans
Lol exactly. If a cis gay man wears a dress, does it makes him trans? Does it makes him less of a man? No. Why should it be the case with afab trans people? Gatekeepers are mad lol
I've gotten this from this from cis friends coming out.   I was reported/banned on an app used by mostly trans folks.
 I am amab enby.   I'm tall and appear male.  I get where other people are coming from.  Especially people who've worked really hard to pass.  But also eff off, I've never claimed a binary transition, sorry if I don't fit binary boxes and I'm over trying to prove my validity, though I've been on and off e for years, grew boobs which I love and have never fit into gender.
don’t listen to them. you don’t need to change your appearance or pass to be considered “trans enough”. trans people can wear whatever we want to wear no matter our agab. this idea that if we really are trans, we have to dress and appear as our true gender, just feels like the trans version of gender norms and “boys wear pants, girls wear skirts!”. literally the only thing that makes someone trans is identifying as a gender that they weren’t assigned with at birth. trans people are valid no matter how we look or dress, sound, or what pronouns we use. that person was literally just spitting out transmedicalist rhetoric. you are valid <3
i’m an amab nonbinary transfem person who uses any pronouns. i’m also cis passing, most people assume im a cis guy. i typically wear more masc/androgynous clothing (although i would love to explore my femininity and wear dresses and skirts but i will literally be assaulted and harrassed in my area) and i am still trans. i’m “trans enough” and so are you <3
Tale as old as time, queers gatekeeping other queers. You don't owe other trans people androgyny.
I've noticed that binary trans people are the least understanding or sympathetic of the nonbinary experience.
""I don't want to gatekeep, but --"" Then don't lol It cost $0 to not demean someone else's gender identity / expression.
If you're no cis then you're trans. It's up to you if you want to use trans for yourself or not. But by definition you're trans.

Sadly there are lots of trans who think that you're only trans when you're mtf or ftm but don't accept nonbinary or nonbinary trans.
Your gender is valid and I’m sorry some people don’t see it. That said, you might wanna check out r/transnames and r/transtryouts for name suggestions
Do you *Identify* as literally anything other than your AGAB?

yes?

Congratulations you're trans I don't get why people do this especially within the trans community like it's really not that hard
If the moderators removed that comment, I'd be happy.
I got booted from that sub for trying to leave a nice and uplifting comment on someone's post, so... I'm glad to have found this space
""Why do you present as an asshole?""
Homies got internalized transphobia. It sucks but don’t let it bonk u down. We’re a hurt community, and hurt people hurt people
Those are people from r/truscum (true scum) and they believe that you must have dysphoria to be trans. It’s like the point of transitioning is getting rid of the gender dysphoria instead of gaining gender euphoria for them. Truly a depressing mindset.
I only found this thread because I stumbled accross a TikTok live of a trans woman shitting on non binary people saying gender is not a social construct, nbs aren’t trans, and gender is binary. 

Honestly it made me pretty upset :( I couldn’t imagine people within the community tearing at each other that way when we are all just trying to live our best lives what is that accomplishing.
I think within the trans community specifically, there’s a lot of pain that manifests as, “If X person does not feel the same pain as me, they are not worthy of saying we share experience/identity with me.” I see it a lot with transmedicalists specifically. They don’t see the irony that the same faulty “logic” is used to exclude trans people (almost always trans women) from “real” gender-hood. “You’re not a real woman if you didn’t grow up suffering for being female” type stuff. Within the trans community it comes from a place of deep hurt. That in no way excuses it though. It’s misdirected anger that should be pointed toward the system that harms all of us by rigidly policing identity expectations.
To be fair, you got just under 300 responses to your post on that subreddit. The *one* person who made an inappropriate comment got removed by the mod team after a couple hours. And not only that, you have a brigade of people downvoting that comment and calling them out for their bullshit. 

I understand that it was triggering to read what they said, and feeling hurt is valid. But I wouldn't go as far to say the *whole subreddit it exclusionary.*
This all reads of gibberish to me, I assume you're okay though.
Go reply to them and tell them they're not trans.

Problem solved.
Ya couldn't just explain to them why ya are the way ya are?  Idk if venting will help much. Just explain it to them and maybe they will understand!
I think this is a really complicated topic, whether or not someone who identifies as an enby also counts as trans is sort of a controversial topic

Some people think of trans people as those who operate within the gender binary, but who identify as the other of the two binary genders than the one they were assigned at birth

Others think of trans people as anyone who is not cisgender, regardless of their views on the binary, this then means that enbies would also be trans by the viewpoint

Personally, I think it's up to the individual which way to identify based on that. Personally, I prefer the first viewpoint insofar as it relates to me, and therefore do not consider myself trans. However, I do also see the validity in the other viewpoint, and I think if an enby thinks of themself as trans as well as non-binary, then I completely agree with their view on their gender

Gender identity is complicated, there's an element of choice, and there's an element that's innate. If you don't fit the exact cultural stereotype of what your AGAB is, you can either choose to identify as a nonstandard member of that gender, or you can choose to identify as something else, potentially non-binary

At the end of the day, they're just words you use to describe your identity, and therefore are totally meaningless out of context. If you're AMAB and your identity is far away from the archetype of a man, whether you choose to identify yourself as a man who doesn't fit the archetype or as an androgynous enby (or any other gender identity) makes no difference, you're still you
So, first, I want to start off by saying that your identity is yours, and it’s valid. Nonbinary people don’t always identify as trans, but some do, and that’s valid.

You also don’t owe any androgyny, or looking one way or another.

But, just to maybe alleviate some of that stress you’re feeling, it helps to know where they are coming from.

While you, as a fem leaning person in the body of a female, probably struggle with the outside world not seeing you as trans. They just see you as a girl, and that can be very dysphoric. However, it’s also safe.
A lot of people do not have that privilege. They can’t even walk out of their house without people “knowing” they’re trans, and that’s a target on their back.

It’s similar to arguments like how white skinned latinx folks will say they’re a POC, but POC will say they’re white, because according to society and safety standards, they are.

So for a binary trans person to get mad at a nonbinary trans person, it’s understandable. They just need time to process, and hearing nonbinary folks say they’re in the same situation as binary folks can be really unsettling when trans people get killed every day.

They shouldn’t have attacked you or came at you on here (or anywhere), and I’m sorry that happened.
I literally just got purposely misgendered over a joke from a fellow trans person. Unfortunately even trans people can be jerks, I've learned that the hard way. Ignore them, only you can say you're trans. Presentation and pronouns aren't equal to gender identity, if that was the case every pre-transition trans person wouldn't be trans under that criteria either, which is ridiculous logic. I am genuinely sorry that happened to you though.
I feel like sometimes as we carve out a space for ourselves, we also build a wall against others without realizing it. Their feelings come from a place of wanting a tribe all their own and it’s a “them” problem, not a “you” problem. When you flow freely from one space to the next, I would guess it throws their sense of belonging into chaos. Don’t let insecure, warped exclusion ruin your day, OP.
That is honestly why I'm not super vocal about being NB -- 

I've always known it to be true, but I go through cycles where I lean into different parts of myself more or less, where I feel like playing up my edges/angles or my curves. -- I that's human, and some people are not shy about letting you know *how* you don't fit *their personal definition of XYZ* and it's just too unnecessarily negative when it's not appropriate, for me.
I can't handle that sub anymore tbh
Fuck all of that. I hate gatekeeping. There isn't a way to look non binary. I'm femme presenting and people often think I'm a woman too. It should be any different that I'm AMAB. What gender I was assigned at birth does not dictate my presentation and it shouldn't dictate yours either.

Idk, I just hate this ""you have to medically transition"" mindset 🙄
passing culture is the worst and  your gender identity isn't for other people to judge. just know you're valid no matter how you present
Lol fuck them
This happens to me a lot (I’m amab and masc leaning in presentation but use they/them and what not) I don’t call myself trans because of this kind of shit. 

But I always say when questioned that I don’t owe them or anyone androgyny
I've gotten kicked out of discord servers that are ""trans friendly"" bc I'm afab and fem presenting. I was only there for so long because they thought I was a trans woman and told me I was ""an embarrassmrnt to trans people"" when I said that I'm nonbinary. so yeah I'm never joining a queer server ever again
'why say you're trans when the only thing different is your identity' Yeah that's what gender is 😂😂
Identifying as trans... is about... gender identity... what are they on about
lol ""the only thing different from your AGAB is your identity"" like, thats what transgender means. having a gender identity different from what you were assigned at birth. how is this an issue?????
I frequent a different trans Reddit for that reason. :( I’m sorry OP
So you’re a female assigned at birth.. okay.. but what do they mean you present as female? They mean you look fem and you’re a female? Also why exactly are you identifying as transgender? Are you non-binary? I personally didn’t get it from the op, I’m not trying to rude just confirm what you actually identify with. I’m just confused by this whole debacle. I’ve accepted being non-binary since I was 13 but I’ve never felt welcomed into trans-community so all of this is just confusing and new. If you identify as being non-binary are they basically saying you’re not “trans” enough? That’s what it looks like and if they feel that way THEY ARE WRONG and you shouldn’t doubt yourself from this one person? People are gonna have different opinions about you, why shed light on the ones that don’t matter and why not shed light on the people actually supporting you?!?
This shit is super annoying when it happens, people constantly use He/Him for me no matter how often I remind them I go by They/Them. From my perspective it seems like they just see an AMAB enby that presents in a masc-leaning way and assume I go by He/They or something.
Uh- idk how to respond but I would say that your nonbinary instead
I don't think the world, sadly the online trans community as well, doesn't understand the 3rd gender (it's more complicated than that, im just very broadly  generalising) and don't understand how we see the world and how we see gender identity. I'm sorry you had that tho. Is hella invalidating, especially when you expect the group you're part of to accept you since nonbinary IS ABSOLOUTLEY PART OF THE TRANS COMMUNITY. SINCE WE'RE DETRANSITIONING INTO THE OTHER GENDER. I for one am in the process of getting a binder. Fem presenting people don't usually do that. You know? We exist. We do. We don't want to tick the square box so why are they all trying to make us.
If I’m non binary does that count as trans ?
the trans subs are extremely binary and it’s sometimes very uncomfortable to try to discuss things there
That’s not detransitionin that’s continuing to transition “this isn’t even my final form!”
love how this is worded ^^^ i second this comment wholeheartedly
This. Also keep in mind that non-binary people are always more supportive than cishets to us binary trans people. I hope we return the support.  It doesn't matter if you physically transition or not: as long as you are comfortable in your skin and being YOU. That is what matters. We get no where with constant gatekeeping eachother.
Also transgender is not short for ‘transition’, it comes from the Latin roots for trans and cis meaning same as (cis) and different (trans).
If you don’t identify with your agab, then you’re trans by definition
I can’t believe I never realised what the colours in the flag stood for before! My mind has been slightly blown XD
The truscum takes are absolutely deranged, I've noticed that they'll claim you're only really trans if you want surgery, but if they reach a position where they'll be able to afford it themselves it flips to you're only valid if you're -going to get- surgery, and then as soon as they've had it they flip further to you're only valid if you've -already had- surgery

&#x200B;

basically, they're like the evil twin of thinking everyone but oneself is valid ""Only I am valid""
Truscum don't have a colour on this flag, due to not being welcome.
Aren’t Truscum people who think you’re trans only if you have crippling dysphoria, and transmedicalists the people you’re describing? Completely agree that they’re both horrible people, but I think the distinction should be clear between them.
Sort of off topic but my cousin (they're 12) came out to me as nonbinary about half a year ago and watching them blossom as an individual and become more confident in themselves has been so beautiful! I wish I'd had the same experience when I was their age, but I am immensely grateful that they *do* have a lot of support from friends and family. ❤️❤️
Absolutely, the whole point of the trans rights movement is to reduce suffering, hopefully to a point where there isn’t any negative social difference between cis and trans.
Stay weird comrade! I promise there are less shitty people waiting for you in this life! Just be you!
EXACTLY!! like dude, do you know how much a well fitting suit for a 5'0 AFAB person is?! It's expensive!!!
Like they said ""why do you use the label transgender when the only thing different from your AGAB is your identity?"" which is word for word the definition of being trans.
Can they all just leave? They might be trans or gay, but they aren't part of the queer community. How can you hate your own siblings???
[removed]
I do enjoy looking like a grey or black blob, but people still try to insist I'm cis
I had no idea these subs existed!! That's awesome, thank you so much!
Ps just because you're non-binary does not mean you owe anybody androgyny dress however you want
It looks like they did! Or it was deleted. Either way, it's gone.
I agree! I can't remember saying the whole sub was exclusionary tho, if I did I must have misspoke.
I did explain, very politely in fact, and even apologized if I somehow did something to make them uncomfortable. A bunch of other people came to my aid and defended me, and the comment ended up being deleted lol
They're the category of trans people stuck in the binary system that was planted in their head. I know it's a wild take but it does make them have pretty conservative views when it comes to gender.
Being trans really just means you dont identify as your natal sex. Nonbinary is definitely under that umbrella. Many NB individuals dont like to use the descriptor of trans for themselves and thats fine but that doesnt change the meaning of the word and wether or not others can use it for themselves as a nonbinary person.
NB is represented by the white stripe on the trans flag.
You do you, identify however you feel good and comfortable, but if you're not the gender you were assigned at birth than I say logically you can call yourself trans.
You define your own gender! No one can tell you if you are or aren't. No one even says that you have to decide right now...you don't!

edit: changed 'sexuality' to 'gender' ... no idea why my brain isn't doing brain things
It falls under the trans umbrella so sort of
Trans. Comes from the word transit, which means that you’ve “arrived” at your gender, so technically non-binary people do fall under the trans label. But as you can imagine, it’s kind of a sticky subject.
Thank you kind soul. :)
Tbh I forget the colors on any of the flags mean things. I'm just always like ""ooo pretty design!!""
my favorite trans flag fact: the reason the flag is symmetrical is so that there's no wrong way to fly it, which is a statement on there being no wrong way to be trans.
truscum and transmedicalist are basically synonymous

transmedicalism is the idea that being transgender requires gender dysphoria OR a desire for medical transition. truscum is a slang word for transmedicalist.
Not sure, I’ve heard truscum applied to both, and transmedicalists to only this group.
It's a venn diagram with very strong overlap.
Thank you so so much 🥺❤️
Ikrrrr uggggghhhh :(
Ok buddy this isn't the place for you and I'm not the trans person to say this to.
Cisgender, socially and literally, means ""not transgender"".
If you have a problem with being referred to as ""not trans"" by a trans person, you clearly have issues and I'm not the therapist to sort them out for you.
Also, the ""you people"" and emphasis on just cisgender women being women implies you're transphobic AF and again: this is not the place, I am not the person.
Trans people exist and have forever, even if the terms cis and trans haven't.
Stop being so goddamn butthurt over the fact that people dare defy what your likely abusive and neglectful parents brainwashed you into believing as fact.
Thanks very much :)
Yeah! I haven’t settled on names yet, myself
That's great to hear. Or read, since that was a text thing on Reddit.
You are not trans if you are non-binary PERIOD. It’s insulting and quite frankly sick of people who don’t experience the same things we do for being trans to say they are!!!
Awesome thanks 😊
So by that then yes cool thanks for telling me
Thanks
Since to me trans is something other than cis I guess by that definition I am transgender but specifically non binary
What do you mean sort of ?
Unrelated, but your username rocks!
What do you mean sticky subject ?
Exactly the same here lol
Big same, I used up all of my brain juice on other things, for better or for worse, so I forgor what the flag colors were for too until this thread.
Gotta differentiate between transgender and transexual. NB people are the 1st one, but often not the 2nd.
Excellent!
Nothing really
This whole thread is about how some people don’t see enbies as trans, hence sticky
Thanks for the help 😊
Why you say sort of ?
Ah ok why is that some people don’t see enbies as trans people ?
Idk, I just do that a lot
I have no idea. Maybe because some see trans as flipping between the binary whereas we exist outside of it
Okie
When you say people see people as being binary and us being outside it that makes me feel powerful and otherworldly and like a god and I love it thanks
Lol you’re welcome
😁😁"	109fqsf	NonBinary	928	0.98	2023-01-11 20:57:42
It’s super dumb but after doing the Rory Gilmore book challenge I saw this and just, whatever, I did it expecting woman, because I’m afab and questioning and things, and I’m so happy right now yo don’t understand🥲😅		"It ain't stupid when it works (correctly).
I got “transgender” 

That’s…

I mean, I guess they got the spirit?
I got agender, which is the gender I identify myself. 
Now I’m suspicious that this test stalked me on reddit or read my texts.
I got cis. Guess hrt for 6 years and top surgery was for nothing
I'm cis apparently, good to know 👌
Everytime I see a quiz like this I just imagine:
""Question 1: What is your gender?""
Ok, I've been confused about my gender for some time and used to think I was binary transgender instead of enby, and I got trans on this test so my confusion kinda came back, I have to meditate and accept that it's just an online test lol
Got a link to the quiz?
It said I'm agender
I got transgender. I dislike quizzes like this with completely random questions and ""who would you date?"" lol no one. At least it didn't have a question about a song lyric!

&#x200B;

I'm glad it made you happy though.
i got ""cisgender"" lmao like even if it was true that wouldnt make any sense for a quiz answer since its so non-specific
I got CIS. F\*\*KING CIS. I'm gonna chug a bottle of bleach now /j.
I got trans... But I'm glad I didn't get cis? 😂
Glad you got some validation. I know these things are dumb but right before, and after coming out I was doing them a fair bit
I got nonbinary, but half my answers were random cuz they didn't apply to me lmao.
THE FACT THAT IT ACTUALLY WORKED???
This one is fun too. The questions are a little more relevant, so even tho it's just another online quiz it'll get you thinking:

https://www.idrlabs.com/7-identities/test.php
I got nonbinary which felt very affirming even though it's an online quiz. I'm sure it's accurate 😉
I dunno mans (the test) said i was cisgender. Im very nb 🤣
Nonbinary here as well! Yay
Hm got agender. I’ll need to think about this!
Phishing.
I got agender…

I’m a non-binary femboy 🤣
I got non binary too but idk what I just did, from all the celebrities the only one I knew was Eliot Page
I got non-binary too, I feel so legitimated 💜
Oh this shit ACCURATE accurate
I got nonbinary too, which is accurate as far as I can tell!
You had me at Rory Gilmore. OG gender envy...
i got nonbinary too

im happy
Apparently Netflix=cisgender, Hulu=agender, and Disney+=nonbinary. So y'all better change your subscriptions to confirm your identity
I guess these silly quizzes can actually be kinda helpful in a way, cause the answer you’re secretly hoping for reveals a lot
The test said I was transgender which is... nope. No gender over here
 Mine was cis 💀 hell nah
Link?
I got Cisgender... which is half right I guess?
yeah you're right, it's a dumb inaccurate quiz because it claimed i'm cis >:(

i'd literally be happy with every other answer - nonbinary, agender, trans, i'm all of these - and yet, i somehow got the one i DON'T identify with??? bruh

half of the questions were not really applicable to me anyway. i don't actively use streaming services. all i know is i like the color blue. i'm also aromantic, so the last q was especially stupid, i tried to skip it but nah i was forced to pick.... 😒

glad others got validated through this though.
I'm shocked that worked. I blame/credit purple and Demi Lovato haha.
It's not stupid if it makes you feel happy and affirmed in your gender!!! Whatever works, y'know?? Things that make you feel good are never dumb or a waste
I got transgender, and I am, but that's not actually a gender at all.
It’s a bit like when they say to flip a coin if you have a decision to make - the outcome doesn’t matter but how you feel when you see which one got picked will tell you how you actually feel. Congrats and welcome <3
I got cis :(
Can I get the link to that quiz? Asking for... Uhhh a friend?
Telll me abouy I swear so many other quizes thought that I was Genderfluid or A Demi girl
one question was “what celebrity would you date” and i got confused because i couldn’t pick all of them
hey, what's the web name, I want to try it up
I hated this quiz as one of the questions was 'who would you date?' and I'm aroace with no intention of ever dating, but quizzes like this in general can be pretty fun.
Jokes On Them I Can't Even Guess My Gender With 100% Accuracy! I'll Give It Like 68%, That Sounds About Right, Maybe 70% On A Good Day.
I mean I’m still questioning but I was really happy when I got non binary! Also quick question: is enby ok or insulting? I’m really new, sorry🙈
Ehhh it kinda is, you’re not non-binary because a test told you you are you’re non-binary because you’re non-binary. That being said I’m glad it made OP happy
You are trans, nothing else. Just constantly fluctuating and moving
😂 maybe it just works really well for some people 🙈 or maybe it stalks people 🧐
I mean it’s not accurate. It was good for me, but it’s just a stupid test online asking the wrong kind of questions 🙈
I mean it’s not accurate. It was good for me, but it’s just a stupid test online asking the wrong kind of questions 🙈
Same 😭
🙈🥲
Me, too! I never knew. O.o
Sorry I didn’t mean to spread confusion 😑 it’s probably not that good anyway since it asks like four questions and one is about attraction! 🙈
tbf trans nonbinary is definitely a thing, but meditating is good for you anyway 😄
Yep, coming! It was a bit of a weird process because it was sponsored on a very different page, but here it is: [gender test](https://quiztest.me/en/test/6137.html?cat=LGBTQ&month=202209&type=normal)
Really like wtf do streaming apps have to do with gender 😭
I got cisgender too, but according to my flight attendant friend who sees thousands of people every week I'm the most masculine woman he ever saw. I guess I'm a man now?
Same
Don't worry fam, these tests are about as accurate as the quizilla website of decades past, obviously you're not cis lmao
same here this is why i hate these quizzes
Yeah, I feel the same. I know these things are dumb, but whenever they don’t say woman I feel so good. I should have noticed something sooner 🥲
My result was a tie between non-binary and agender. I’m confused now 😂
I like this one much more! I don't want to take a quiz that genders music taste and streaming platforms!
It’s really not, but I’m happy for you!
🤷🏻🙈
Same! 🧡
It’s not accurate, it’s mostly for fun, I was just happy I got non binary, you know? Also I think the only answer used is who would you date, and I would have chosen the option no one ever if there was one
In the comments… it’s one of the oldest
something something ""it's not the result that matters, it's how you feel about the result"" still rings very true i think
Must of us are ok with enby, though some people find it infantilizing
I love enby for myself but some people find it infantilizing. Using it for yourself is fine, and as a group is usually ok but check with individuals
Personally, I’m not 100% convinced when it comes to the term “enby”, but it’s the only term that’s kind of the equivalent of “man” or “woman” but for non-binary people and I don’t like calling myself “non-binary person” in most contexts because it’s so long.
I got validatet, so it's pretty correct
Not inaccurate lol
I hope it’s the first option. I don’t want to be stalked by someone
Pretty disappointed they couldn't tell my gender identity based off my choice of streaming platform and favorite color lol
Don't worry, I just found out I'm still and maybe will always be questioning myself, and that's not necessarily a bad thing!
Lol I also got non-binary

Are we all just a hivemind or something? Do we all answer it exactly the same?
i got transgender.... which is not a gender lol
First time through answering honestly I got nonbinary. 

Then when I answered using the least favorable answer I got ""Cisgendered.""
I got agender, not true at all lol. I am overflowing with gender
yeah this was not accurate for me. I got agender which is not right. I am Non-binary trans masculine. So no thanks. Plus in my personal experience I am the only one who can determine what is right for me. No quiz online can ever do that. I have found being on a subreddit like this and just reading other people's experiences in life and how they feel has been the most helpful in discovering how I feel. It's pretty wild when a post or the comments on a post jump out at you as if this random person in the internet were discribing you exactly but only talking about themselves. Like  wait a second.... Someone else feels this way. *Gasp*😱
The only problem for me with that test was the dating question since I'm aromantic.

Anyway i got agender which is pretty accurate. So i guess my answer based on asthetic still worked
I got cis, which is just not true.
I had multiple options on a few so i did both and both came back as agender, interesting 🤔
Lol I got agender that ain’t it probably
Oh I know, it’s just always this way so it’s infuriating xD
I like enby/enbie as a substitute for ""girl"" or ""boy"". I use nonbinary where I'd use ""woman"" or ""man"" for binary people. Except I prefer it as an adjective rather than a noun, while enbie works fine as a noun
Thanks ☺️
The thing is, I used Enby because NB already has a fairly common use. NonBlack. And thus since enby is recognized as nonbinary, I am fine with giving the NB Tag to the bipoc community use
Thanks ☺️
Same. Also, I got non binary and I’m still questioning.
Actually, probably same!
If you switch black and blue for colours it stays non binary, I know because I tried
lmao same. got agender when im really gender fluid between *kinda* girl but not, just straight up neutral and *ELDRITCH ABOMBINATION*
I got cis.
It’s not accurate
If we weren't questioning we wouldn't be making those quizzes I guess lol
I picked purple lol

Now I wonder what the percentages are.
Obviously, I am well aware that you can't guess anyone's gender from whether they like Hulu or HBO Max, it just stings a little in an irrational way ok :(
Welp. Maybe they use the other answers and or say to most non binary because it’s an umbrella term? But then they would probably use trans most. Who did you choose for date?
Yeah, I get it, like it’s irrational that I felt good 🙈
I chose the only one I know out of the four, pfft

Hi! I’m Jess. New to reddit and just came out as non-binary in January. Been on HRT for 2.5 months. Don’t know too many people who relate to a amab nb feminine identity so would love to hear from others about their experience with HRT and social experiences after they came out. Thanks!		"[deleted]

im not on hrt but hello, fellow amab nb fem person!!
You're beautiful ❤🧡💛💚💙💜
Welcome Jess. You look lovely. I love your makeup. I also am a amab and a strong feminine identity. (Chloe)
First of all. Wow. You look fantastic. Secondly I'm amab nb (they/he) but I really want to present more feminine more often. What's a good starting point?
I am AFAB nb and masculine but my significant other is AMAB nb and feminine and I wish I could get them into reddit. Just know you're not alone and you are valid, also a total babe ❤️
I'm in the opposite boat so I can't really speak to your question but I'm in love with your aesthetic, omg.
I'm an AMAB femmeby too! I'm super jealous of your makeup skills; you're way better at it now than I am after over two years on HRT. You also just have super feminine features.
omigosh! u are such goals!!! I'm also amab feminine enby on HRT. It's... tough. So glad to meet you!
Thanks! Nice to meet you! I been doin my makeup for 10 years and been painting since I was a little kid, so just stick with it! All the tutorials on YouTube help and the real secret is quality makeup and *brushes*! 🖤
Hi Jess! I’m an amab nb trans woman. Been on HRT for 1.5 years and working toward getting bottom surgery. Your make up is beautiful, you’re beautiful, and you look so genuinely happy. And that’s one of the most important parts. When I saw myself, bald head, full makeup, contour dress, that feeling is something I won’t forget. Hold on to it and remember it when the world tells you that you’re “wrong.” Because really, it’s the world that’s wrong, not you.
Hello Jess! I'm Jody, AMAB NB transfem, 3.5 months hrt. Love the make-up, you've got that on lock. I feel like I'm 12 playing with mom's stuff everytime I try. Little by little I'm getting better though. Her for me has been pretty great, starting to get some curves in the hips, breasts are starting to be noticeable, even with a right bra. The biggest change is been my mental state. Just feel like my mind is clearer than it has been in years. Things that used to feel like the biggest chores, like keeping my apartment clean and cooking for myself is easier to just get up and do. And while I still have some mild depression occasionally (much lower than it used to be), I can usually do something productive like go for a walk instead of watching TV and eating junk food. Hope your transition goes well!
Hey! I'm also transfemme, not sure if NB or just girl. Although I just started HRT and haven't done much socially yet. My immediate family is accepting, though :)
Hey! Glad to see another transfeminine non binary person :D
I started hrt last Wednesday (3/7/2019), and spiro about an hour ago :)

The first week of HRT freaked me out. I was anxious, more depressed, and feeling shit. After that week passed, I’ve actually been really good! My brain is a lot calmer than it has in years. While I’m typing this, I’m currently only hearing what I’m typing, in my head, which is a big change to the constant distress.
My face is a bit softer and rounder, but since I haven’t been on it for long - I haven’t had the chance to see any more results.
AMAB transfemme enby here too. Been on HRT off and on for about a year but still don’t have my hormones quite right (got booted from insurance because of lost paperwork while I was fucking homeless after I lost it when I was fired). While I’m lucky to live in a somewhat accepting city with trans roommates, I’m no stranger to homelessness and joblessness by now. I cannot turn to my parents and I have a very limited network of friends who make enough to actually lend me a hand from time to time. I can’t lie, my transition experience has been rough AF, thanks largely to how entirely fucked the American healthcare system is. I really hope your experience with it goes much more smoothly than mine 🖤

Cycling on and off hormones is a fucking rough rollercoaster to ride. I really hope you have a more stable insurance situation if you are American, as I would not wish my woes upon anyone. If you’re not in the U.S. then congrats!

Thankfully, the only issues I’ve really had with my transition socially have been due to the hormone fluctuations making me a moody bitch. I had previously weeded out conservatives just by being my proudly queer, openly socialist self. The only real loss was my parents, but as they’re pretty conservative and extremely brainwashed by their deep faith in Catholicism, I can’t profess I really thought they’d stand by me. My two little brothers are also queer though they’re cis, and they’ve been my staunch allies in standing up to my parents in my absence.

Here’s hoping your circumstances are far more fortuitous than mine have borne out to be!
Oh hey, I’m AMAB NB feminine. And I’m also Jess 🤪

1.5 years HRT so far
dang you look great!! I know a few amab enby folks
Hi!  I’m still a little in the closet (out to family and friends, not work) but I just got my HRT bloodwork done so I’m really excited to hear y’all’s experiences. 

Most people are just confused about me being at all feminine, shoved it way down for years and grew a huge beard, but my family is alright, and I love when I feel brave enough to go out in makeup, dressed androgynously/femininely.  It feels incredibly defiant and I resonate hardcore with the bad bitch within. 

Either way, I’m Willow, nice to meet you.
You're dazzling! And that tree of life necklace is dope!
I too identify as a nb trans femme person.

I actually do want to start socially transitioning soon and also get on HRT eventually.

Kinda nervous about starting the process.

I wish there would be more people like us coming out so I wouldn't be scared about saying that I'm nb & trans publicly.

One of things unfortunately that I've started to notice in recent years is that some binary trans people are not very accepting of the existence of gender nonconforming individuals.

They feel like the gender nonconforming community doesn't fall under the trans umbrella which is of course is total b.s. that they think that.

So yeah I think that has also made me hesitant to start my transition.

I want to be a part of community that will fully accept me being both non binary and trans without any issue.

Still despite being worried about that, I want to transition anyway because that honestly would make me happy to live in my truth.
Hey hey! I'm NB Femme and I feel what you're saying. I use mixed pronouns (she/they) and my presentation is pretty mixed as well. I feel power in getting to confuse people with both my appearance and my mannerisms. Have any questions?
I’m also that thing you described and tbh I’ve been feeling nervous about my place in either group because of it but this thread has shown me there is a place for us in the nb world
I'm the oppisite. Afab and trans masc nb but I wish you the best of luck. Btw you look very pretty!
Fellow AMAB Enby here! Currently trying to appear less masculine myself and looking at my options.
You’re gorgeous hope you’re day is stupendous
Hey! Just another amab nb transfemme here. Meeting with my doc on Monday to talk about starting HRT. Hope your day is absolutely lovely.
hello another amab nb here!! not on HRT it doesn’t feel right for me, i’m considering go High Femme but also that requires a lot of work and my depression will not let me do that (im also terrible at makeup). being nb in a binary world is perplexing to me, like, i’m wearing a skirt and “lady’s” shoes and stockings so i must be A Girl but i have broad shoulders and shitty facial hair so i must be A Boy and people tend to go w/ the latter because i’m clearly just a Man In A Skirt/Dress and i am Frustrated™️. someone above mentioned that people understood they were trans but not that they were nb which is a Big Mood, my entire family can do name changes but not pronouns apparently?? 

this was a lot longer than i intended it to be sorry for venting a lil bit anyways you look so nice!!!
(kit/iden -haven’t decided which name)
I too am an AMAB femmeby! I've been out for about a year and a half, on hrt for a little over 9 months. Everyone I've come out to has been super accepting, but my physical transition is frustratingly slow.
Fellow transfemme nb here, I don't often present when I'm out of the house, but so far I've been pretty accepted by friends and family (those that I've told at least). Thinking of switching the name I'm trying out from Valen (which everyone mispronounces for some reason) to just Lynn, since that'll also match my online name of GaLYNddra. I've got a genderfluid boyfriend who has been a great help in transitioning, and in general helping me figure myself out. Been on HRT for 5 months-ish, with great results so far!

Love the hair, planning on going a bit Purple myself as it's my favorite color!
Hey, not NB but I must say, you look beautiful!
Awesome :D
Thought I was kind of alone with how I was feeling in that first week. Glad to see you’re having positive results too! :)
Hey, I'm amab, but I identify as male/enby genderfluid. My friends were all very happy to adopt my new name, and always supportive of my they days and feminine outfits. My parents are resistant to accept nonbinary gender entirely, so my attempt to come out to them ended as more of a lecture on their part about not jumping on bandwagons and concerns for my future if I continue to dress in female clothing. But I only see them every couple of months, and my fam is very supportive and the Canadian government is currently on our side. I still get the occasional shout from a car window, but I've never been approached or threatened by a person on foot. Overall, I found my tribe and only wish to be happy and make the path easier for future enby like me.
Hi! I am also amab nb feminine but I am not out to anyone other than immediate family. I have my first appointment for hrt on Monday 😀

Your hair and makeup look great!
I'm not out yet. Tbh I don't think I ever can be. But hearing stories like yours makes me smile. Maybe one day I wont have any reason to be scared.
You're so pretty!
I'm also an amab nb trans femenine. Been on hormones since March 2018.
>amab nb feminine

Me!!!! Memememe!!! Me bitch me!! You're hot and also goals, gotta say.

Haven't done HRT but I am strongly considering it. As far as social stuff, all my peers outside of work were immediately supportive or, at the very least, okay with it but it's a bit different of a story with my job and my parents. It's a process.
YOU'RE GORGEOUS
i’m not on hrt but i’m a p fem leaning amab enby!! it’s lovely to meet someone like me, sometimes it feels a lil lonely being amab and nonbinary. also your hair is gorgeous!!! i love the variation in the colours, and those blues do wonderful things for your eyes
Well hey, fellow AMAB Enby, I'm Nora! Hoping to get on HRT soon myself, so I've no clue how it goes, but I'm eager to find out lol. As for coming out, I was hella nervous about the whole thing but I put it into 2 parts. I came out to my parents as Non-Binary (who were very confused about it but luckily I had a friend to help translate into something that folks from a small country town could understand). But thankfully they were supportive and my anxiety was misplaced. My name change however was about 5 times more anxiety filled. I changed my name on all my social media's (I think, might have missed one) and then made a post on them, it was very blunt but it got what needed to be said across.

But I'm almost in the same boat as you here, I've only been openly Non-Binary since about February :P
Hello!! I am non-binary and amab. I went from cis straight guy to cis bi guy to cis gay guy to agender gay between middle school and starting college, however I don’t plan on explaining my gender identity to my family ever because I know they won’t get it, so I am only out as non-binary to people my age.

I have a question: How did you come about deciding to start HRT? I have a hard time deciding exactly how feminine I want to feel/present because I live in a very conservative state and have a shitty family and some very “male” body traits (while also having some more “feminine” body traits), not to mention it took me a long time to even realize how I actually perceive my gender and sexuality (which could still change!). I almost always just present masculine or at most slightly femme gay with some makeup because it’s so much easier in terms of how other people perceive me and my comfortability level for anything more feminine is so low. It’s hard to know how far I want to go when I’m stuck presenting this way :/ I know I dream of being able to wear clothes made for women because they’re infinitely more cute/sexy/stylish, but there are a few elements of men’s fashion I enjoy wearing as well. Anyway, I have just thought about HRT ever since I learned about it and I can never decide if I feel as though it would be something I’d want to do in the future, so how did you know it was right for you?
Interesting! Gonna look into that. Getting sleepy for now! Will check in tomorrow! 😁
Not doing HRT, but I'm loving being femme out in the open. A lot of people have assumed that I'm just gay, or one person thought I was ftm, which I'm taking as a misguided, but appreciated compliment. 

Generally, most people have actually been super accepting - especially my students, who are quite happy to just go with it - and when they mess up pronouns and stuff, it's clear that they aren't being malicious.
I’m AFAB nbinary and enjoy femme presenting!!! Which comes with a separate set of similar but different experiences Ofc!
Another AMAB enby here! Been on HRT 4 months now. I'm probably feminine leaning, but still figuring out how I want to present. I thought I'd have to present much more feminine to stop being seen as a man, but I've been getting gendered female often now. 

It's really nice to see all the transfeminine enbies show up in this post! I think we are not as rare as it seems sometimes.
Same! I’ve always enjoyed dressing feminine and groomed in such a way from a young age. I started wearing makeup and cross dressing androgynously in a way, but with female tailored clothing about 10 years ago. Then this year I finally understood what was going on.
Oh thanks! I love makeup. Helps me love who I see looking back at me in the mirror. Wasn’t always the case.
Considering the fact that I can barely put on eyeliner I’m super fucking impressed, keep it up!
Thanks! Here’s to our own titties and better orgasms! Haha. I’ve always had good control of my substance use. But I appreciate that heads up. Stress can definitely trigger that kind of thing.
Ik thats advice was for OP but damn did it hit hard. Just out of highschool a year early, been on E for 6 months and am planning on starting Bach of Engineering in the fall. But so not in a good headspace. I'll take ur advice into consideration big time.
I only started on HRT a few months ago myself, and my life is anything but stable. It really wasn't before I started though.

I find how I present I often just don't get gendered, but if I do I usually get gendered male. I don't really have any people in my life that I can come out to. My family isn't accepting and I don't think most of my old friends would be either, a few might, but I moved far away from my family in order to transition, and might not ever go back to there anyway.
Cool! Thanks too! Yeah I see most presenting as down the middle as possible but I like this way better for me. The misgendering is super real though and can get frustrating. How’s that going with you?
Hi! 🥰
Thanks 🥰
Hi! Nice to meet you! Thanks 🥰 Guess I came to the right place!
Hi! Thank you so much 🖤

For me I started with good foundation and makeup fundamentals. A good human hair wig goes a long way if you don’t have a feminine hair style too.
I wish I woulda gotten on here forever ago! Didn’t realize all my friends were here and I’m late to the party! Yay! Haha. And thank you! I feel so hot n sexy now it’s the best ever. I showed an Uber driver my before/after pic from 2 years ago to January (no hrt even, just makeup and 50lbs lost) and he asked me if my current pic was my ex wife. That was awesome. I chuckled.
Ha thanks 🖤🖤🖤🥰🥰🥰
Hi! Nice to meet you too! And thanks! ☺️ 

We gonna do this together. 🖤

How long you been on HRT?
Couldn’t agree more! Gotta trust yourself. 🖤 I am genuinely happier than ever. I appreciate you noticing! And thank you for the compliments! I am now sexier than I ever thought I could be and only gonna get hotter I hope! 🔥🥰
 Nice! I am noticing similar changes. I really enjoy the range of emotions I’m allowing myself to feel now. My nipples are so sensitive too rn omg lol. Happy to meet you! 🥰
That’s great! I wish mine was, but they didn’t accept me at any point so why would they when I come out? I didn’t even expect them to, but the hope was still there I suppose. My whole family is Mormon like 4 generations back, so no surprise there. 🤷🏻‍♀️ I relate to still figuring things out. Took a while for me to land on NB Transfemme. I mean,  it’s even on a lesser accepted scale of non binary than non binary itself lol.
My first week was craziness too! Lol. It did level out pretty soon thereafter. That’s awesome you’re seeing positive effects! I feel the same way and have experienced similar mental and emotional improvements. 🖤
Sorry to hear about the rough road! I'd like to say mine is less rough, but it's not too far off of what you've described actually. My family is Mormon and I've not been a part of all that for a bit over 10 years. Coming out really hasn't changed anything in that regard. I'm fortunate though that I have a part time employer (Saturday/Sunday) that allows me to be me (helps I sell more than anyone) and during the week I'm a full time freelancer doing photography, graphic design, web design, etc. 

The self employment aspect has really allowed an option to be myself, and I can't say I don't feel privileged and fortunate to have the skills and talent to allow me that option, because I am very grateful this is the case. 

I've had to go off hormones for a week and change while I wait to afford the next month's worth, but nothing extreme. I am in the US but there is a local health clinic that specializes in Trans services and I can pay cash ($60) for my visits. I have discount coupons for the prescriptions that bring it down to about $30/mo from $150/mo. So with that I am alleviated of some of those more major hurdles you've described, though I am familiar with unemployment and homelessness, so I empathize. 

Hope you find the balance you need. I'm here as support in whatever way I can. xo
Hey name twin! 🥰🤷🏻‍♀️🤪

How’s your experience been?! What were your original goals? Have you met/are you meeting them?
Aww thanks! I feel great. I’m excited to meet more of us! 🥰
Ha.  Nice to meet you! Here’s to the bad bitch in both of us. 🖤
Thank you! And I love this necklace. It called to me. 

“The tree of life is a symbol of a fresh start on life, positive energy, good health and a bright future. As a symbol of immortality. A tree grows old, yet it bears seeds that contain its very essence and in this way, the tree becomes immortal. As a symbol of growth and strength.”

This symbol is very representative of who I am and who I wish to continue to become. 🖤
I totally understand. It seems like the community you’re seeking is right here! Though in person helps I get it. I’m blown away by how many people I’ve been missin out on here though!

Took me so long to even realize what was going on, coming from such a conservative origin, that when I finally decided to go for it, it was pedal to the metal with no apologies. So let’s be loud together then n let em know what’s up! 🙌🏻

Glad to meet you!
I mix it up a bit too actually! This is my extreme fem side. My masc extreme is twink pretty much lol. Not that masc. But! I am on hormones so I’m sure that gap will shrink, and I’d prefer it does. 

How do people close to you take the change ups?
So happy about that! We’ll make our own place either way. 🥰
Thanks! 🥰
Thanks! It’s good yeah!
Hi! My day is great yep! Just bein a self absorbed wino today. 🤪 How exciting, too! You been considering it for a while?
Haha. No problem! I’m happy to facilitate a proper venting if needed! Yeah, I totally get the nb in a binary world. It’s just like how I know my parents will never accept who I am, regardless of gender, let alone on the topic of gender;  so I just accept myself, and everyone else’s opinion is irrelevant when it comes to how I see and feel about myself. It’s tough but it’s a daily choice, hourly, minutely. But eventually the thought process becomes your reality and that paradigm works for you on a subconscious level. Practice makes perfect. Friends help too. Nice to meet you! 🥰
Hi! Nice to meet you. ☺️ Yeah I’m impatient with mine but it’s only been a couple months. Glad you’re finding acceptance! Definitely makes it easier. I came out in a small town of 400 people, so I was basically like, “deal with it.” Lol
Nice! Yeah having an accepting and supporting partner sounds great! I’m rollin with the single life for a good while myself. I change up the hair all the time but diggin the purple lately too, thanks! ☺️
Well thank you 🥰
 Nice! I’m excited for you! And thank you. 🖤
I don’t know anything about you... but I know fear... and fear is all of your own making. 

I am here to support you with whatever you choose whenever you choose it though! And from the response I’ve gotten here so far, there’s many more friends that can lend support. 

🥰🥰🥰
 Nice to meet you! How’s the HRT going for you? What kind of plan did you take on and what have your effects and experience been so far?
Support is good! I can see you have excitement too! Lol. Also good. Job and parents is the tricky part yep haha
Thank you mucho 🖤🥰😁
Thanks! Yeah I was feeling a bit unicorn-ish myself. Probably really am/we are. Or just the fact that masculinity is overrated and overemphasized on ‘males’ in our society, many who are like us might either just see themselves as gay or fem or just are avoiding it and don’t understand there’s more to themselves, or something. 

Tbh, it’s a wig! I’m choosy so mine always look natural, but I’m still growing out my real hair since I’ve always worn it really short. It’s about 2.5-3 inches now. Growing slooowwww. So I have fun with different looks. Took me a min to be ok with changing it up often but now I just view it as an accessory.  Will be nice when my real hair gets to a desired feminine length so I can jus my be me without dressing up at all though!
For me it took from January to March researching the effects and timelines. I knew I wanted more fem and I told the dr the side effects I was ok with and the ones I wasn’t. Then they did the rest for me and I’ve really enjoyed the decision and can tell I’m headed in the direction I wanted, even though I didn’t know exactly what that looked like at the start. Just kinda took a leap. 🙂
Nice! Glad to hear that. The kids these days are much more open and on point with pronouns and gender identity. Makes me optimistic for the future. My parents generation is shit. Mine is hangin in there. The one after me is pretty good, and these kids now are 🙌🏻
Hi! Yeah it’s similar probably in the realm where it’s not what people expect and you catch some shit for it here and there yeah?!
Hi! Yeah sometimes it seems like there’s only 4 of us ever recorded lol. Seems like we struck a chord here and all needed this place to state our existence! I’m really happy it’s been like this. I absolutely didn’t expect this. 

Great to meet you!
Yessssssdsssssssssssss

I'm like 1 year in on hrt, a decade in doubting being cis. I. Love. HRT.

Also do you feel like being enby is a political statement?
[deleted]
I have shoulder length hair so that isn't an issue. A lot of times I feel pretty top dysphoric and I wish I had a softer jawline. I love everything I have going on downstairs tho. I'm at a really weird in between and I dont really know what to do abt it but you're definitely inspiring me.
6 months, im 17 :3 

Just graduated highschool. I've got a supportive family and a wonderful group of friends, but dysphoria is still hell. And trying to move forward is a struggle
HRT has been very good overall & stabilising mentally. 

I wanted to look and feel way more femme without necessarily wanting to present full time as a woman as such. I think as I’ve progressed, I’ve actually felt my gender is a bit further in the femme direction than I realised, although I still identify as NB trans femme rather than MTF. 

I have ditched just about all of my body and face hair with laser + electrolysis for some stubborn facial ones and that’s been a long time goal and has felt super affirming. 

I currently have boobs that are mostly just for me and I like it like that, so far. I have only occasionally male failed... but if I’m presenting femme so far it is usually fairly subtle, and I suck at makeup. 

I had too many years of testosterone 😢 so my face is nearly always gendered male I’d say, even with makeup. I’ll probably do FFS in the next year or so ... but even with a more feminised face I will likely look ambiguous because of height, skeleton etc .. which I think I’m pretty ok about. 

Goals were mainly to feel happier and more authentic, which I am overall going ok with but still a work in progress. Ideally I’d like strangers to have a reasonable chance at getting my gender right, which to me means they either think I’m femme/female or ambiguous and a bit confusing but looking more like a confused woman than I dude, if that makes any sense shrug 🤷‍♀️ 

I hadn’t realised I had genital dysphoria until I started HRT, which has been an interesting process. I’m waiting for orchi in the next couple of months, and will see how that goes. Once I realised my body is actually mine (duh) that has seemed like exactly what I want and can’t wait til it’s done. 

After FFS and orchi, my goals would be to present convincingly enough to do say yoga or sports in femme mode and look more or less female to casual observers. I still don’t really intend to present female full time, but I guess partly that will depend how I feel with a more femme face & minus some equipment 😉 

I’m keeping an open mind and trying to enjoy the process even though it’s very challenging at times (mostly because of others around me rather than internal stuff, since starting HRT). 

Oh, and being Jess is awesome 😎
Sorry to add to what’s already a wall of text, but I just realised an important HRT goal for me. I have implanted estrogen which is amazing and only needs replacing every 9 months or so. It’s felt great not to be popping pills, more like my body is just how it should be. 

As soon as my orchi is done I can stop my anti-androgen too. 

I do currently take progrestone too, to maybe (?) help with breast shape, but will probably stop that before too long since I’m not super convinced it’s doing anything that useful .. and I want to feel like a NB transhuman from the future without the need for taking daily pills. That’s my HRT #goals 😄
Carl Jung also wrote about trees being symbols of androgyny and the integration of the masculine and feminine as they both resemble a phallic shape but are simultaneously also life-givers in their environments, as per the traditional gender stereotypes.

If you haven't seen it already then you may enjoy *The Fountain*, a film by Darren Aronofsky, in which the tree of life is a prominent aesthetic and narrative motif.
I've been wearing the tree of life symbol for years, well before I started even relating to the NB label (AMAB). Beautiful to see it being used in such an amazing look!
Glad to meet you also!

Also your makeup looks flawless!

Yeah I grew up very religious (Christian) and that was not easy.

I get nervous about people from my old church
reacting negatively to me when I come out as nb/trans.

Some family members of mine are also conservative and very devout in their Christian faith.

I definitely need to not care what other people think for sure and live life to the fullest.

Anyway thanks for the welcome!
My weird coping mechanism is acting like nothing's different because... Nothing's different. I look different but I live and work in a really weirdly judgmental space in terms of my capacity to do things, so showing that my gender doesn't matter with reference to my capacity to perform means I sort of have be really arrogant with my gender obstinacy.

It has a weird side effect too, which is that the more I act like nothing's different with me, the more easily accepted I seem to be, pronouns and all.

I'm also probably uncomfortably open with my transition and stuff that has to do with my physiology and mood so when I bring that up specifically to my femme friends it gives me a weird sense of kinship with how strange human bodies are.
Np
Nice! And yeah, I’ve been thinking about it for a while, and finally decided to start taking steps to make my body better match my desired presentation. I’m really excited!
It was really odd, he and I got together 9 years ago in school, but weren't ready yet, so we broke up. Got together again 5 years ago, got him to finally come out and start HRT, then 2 years ago I came out to him, and 5 months ago I started HRT. So lucky our relationship has survived all these changes, but we're both pan, so...

Always remember, sometimes people aren't the right person yet for things to work.
Hrt has been fantastic to me... I've had lots of good experiences mentally and my sex drive has been awesome. I've also improved my quality of life and just in general improved my life. I'm currently looking into getting non binary viginoplasty
Thank you for your reply! I’m glad you are headed in the right direction. :)
Something I've noticed, which may or may not actually be true, is that AMAB enbies seem more likely to be *completely* closeted. AFAB enbies seem more likely to at least be presenting more masculine/androgynous, even if they're not yet out as nonbinary.
What no. What. Enby is not a political statement. We're not gender trenders, I just honestly don't fit into the binary.
Yeah the misgendering at first was no biggie but the more feminine I get the more annoying it is. Of course, some just assume female. That one doesn’t bother me. But in a binary world, non binary will need an explanation for the foreseeable future I’m guessing.
Totally get it about the jawline. It’s the only surgery I’m considering actually. Laser removal of the face and neck is first though. I do a good job in pics and with makeup covering both. Jaw isn’t so bad but the beard is my unrelenting nemesis. Grrr!!! I’d say just keep on femin as much as you can and be creative and let confidence do the rest. I figure if I own the shit out of my transition then anyone hating looks like a prick. 🖤🖤🖤
Oh goodness I wish I had that situation. So happy for you. I’m 36 and just came out this year! Although I did start presenting a similar way around 26ish but then stopped. 

Either way, I’m jealous and super excited for you. 🖤🥰
Sounds a lot like my goals and things I’m considering. The laser removal on my face is first order of business. It can’t happen soon enough. Just with that I look really feminine. I have boobs starting and looking forward to more! I also am more feminine than originally self perceived but am ok with whatever I settle in to. 

Nice to hear someone has similar perspectives and doing similar things. Didn’t know about the implanted estrogen. I’ll look into that. The only other thing I take is finasteride (propecia) as a DHT blocker since I wasn’t sure how fem I wanted to go. So doc gave me that. Also because spiro pretty much kills your dick. I still use that, being bi. So that’s a thing. 🙃
Darren Aronofsky is my favorite director. 🖤
Nice! Yeah I was out searching for a pendant necklace. The last one I used to wear was a pentagram given to my ex wife by the church of satan. I just like the provocative nature of it and it was extremely well crafted! But it carried her energy for sure. Lol.

I needed something that was more me. After a couple weeks, this one called to me from the corner of a little boutique in a small tourist town. 

Much better fit. 🖤🥰🌈
This all sounds very familiar! Yeah this is my approach too. I didn’t really consciously conceive it, more like naturally settled into it out of self preservation in a Darwinian sense almost.
Excellent 🖤 Can’t wait to see what comes of it. It’s a fun adventure.
I believe this. I didn’t even realize I was closeted until I said to my ex wife one day, “At least I’m out!” To which she replied, “babe, no you’re not.”

The next day I left the house fully dressed, amateurish compared to this pic for sure!!! But literally the next day I was out. I wasn’t going to consciously not be my authentic self anymore. 

Pro tip: LSD helped me find my center enough to finally do this too... 😉🤷🏻‍♀️
I believe this, based on personal experience.
I feel like myself, but I really struggle to integrate that with society
How is it not a political action? There are people who would like to legislate us out of existence. All public actions and many private ones are political by nature, because of the ways your existence interacts with law and society.

It used to be illegal for someone to wear clothing not of their assigned gender, for men to wear makeup or women to wear slacks. Politicians right now are trying to strip away access to trans medical care and create a ridiculous situation with bathrooms.

When what you just happen to be is unfairly persecuted on a systemic level, yor existence becomes politicized, whether you like it or not. It’s unfortunate, but it’s the truth of living in this cisheteronormative society. I personally find it helpful to be aware of this fact.
[deleted]
Great advice thanks. Let's be friends 😊
How in the world do you look so feminine with starting HRT at 36?!?!?! that's... wow!
Implanted estrogen isn’t common unfortunately ... but it should be, it’s really effective and convenient. I don’t think big pharma like the fact that it means no pill-popping, so it hasn’t been too widely researched, particularly in trans patients (but there’s some studies in menopausal cis women). 

I’m pan so totally get wanting to use dick sometimes 😊 I take bicalutamide as my AA and dick is still quite functional with two changes: no spontaneous erections or morning wood (which is fine by me) .. and one that was a bit unexpected but I’ve got to kinda like, which is no cum (or precum) at all, ever .. but way better orgasms. Weirdly I don’t really miss cum, even though I used to enjoy it ... and being pan/bi I figure I can always “borrow” someone else’s if needed 😉 😆 ☔️
His work is amazing though I've still yet to watch *Mother!* despite it sitting in my queue for awhile now.
Right, it's kind of like saying I exist if you don't agree with it you're just wrong
> LSD helped me find my center enough to finally do this too... 

Mushrooms made me feel truly free to be nonbinary for the first time years ago, even when I did not know it myself yet, and that trip was one of the events that made me start seriously researching and pursuing transition!
Right, that's sort of how I feel and that's okay because we are not heteronormatively and socially obvious as a population. there's no template for our appearance other than a few occurrences in a few different societies that recognize third genders. We do exist outside of the norms that determine most of cis het society, so I can see how frameworks of presentation could be seen as ""rebellious"", but that's almost entirely because our identity doesn't have a template in the first place. Our presentation is what's cements our visibility, but it doesn't necessarily define it.

It's sort of like 'some lesbians look like Butch lesbians but not all lesbians are Butch lesbians'. Your presentation doesn't define your gender.
I totally agree with your statement I just don't agree with the vocabulary that's use in the preceding statements which is why I got so inflammatory. I'm not talking about presentation, I'm talking about being.

You're right, presentation is a form of rebellion and it is inherently political but being non-binary does not necessarily mean that you are being political with your identity and that's what I was most alarmed by. Language is super important oh, the difference between our presentation and how it matches our identities versus what our identities are relate to one another but are not the same thing.

I guess what I'm saying is there's a difference between someone being a kind of person and someone presenting as a woman by wearing pants, or a man wearing noon cishey makeup or an NB wearing both and fucking with all on lookers because that's inherently about reception rather than identity.
Sammmmeee! So annoying when a guy is in my face like, “right bro?!” I’m like 🙄
I’ve always been pretty feminine naturally. And the hormones have helped a bit. But can’t wait to see what happens in a year or two! Oiii. I’m excited. 😁

I’m also great with makeup. And I’m a professional photographer so all that helps too. 🤷🏻‍♀️☺️
Omg Mother! is craziness lol. Must see.
Oh yeah I suppose that does lol and u r definitely amazing at makeup! keep me posted? it'll distract me from my process and give me some hope I could turn out okay too lol

Jokingly (because I don’t decide anyone’s sexual identity for them) said to my cis hetero boyfriend, “you know, technically, dating me means you’re not straight” and this was his response. I have an amazing partner.		"I once said the phrase “I’m very gay and my gender is weird enough that if you’re attracted to me you’re gay too” and the man who would become my boyfriend (and is now just a dear friend) gleefully responded “see you at pride!”
Oh yeah this is the type of strong, healthy relationships we like to see, heck yeah 🎀💝🐌💕💞💞🎀💕🐌💖💘
When I first transitioned from ftm, an ex boyfriend of mine wasn’t very comfortable about it. But recently, we had to introduce ourselves for a class and we played 2 truths, one lie. It made me so happy to hear him say “I have an ex boyfriend” as one of his truths even though he is completely straight. People truly do open their hearts with time.
Cute 🥺💕
I love this to an asinine extent
Your boyfriend is Guy Fieri?  Well jealous over here...
You are so lucky :) it's a lovely place to be in life!
They love u
This is wholesome
Reminds me of my bf, when I told him about me doubting my gender. (He's bi/pan) He said ""I love you either way.""
This is sweet :)

On a related note, I feel like straight, gay, and bi are going to start losing their meanings as non-binary identities become more recognized and accepted... we need new non-clinical sounding words. 

Leaning towards andro and gyno, since it fits with the shortening of pan(sexual).
Well, if the Kinsey scale has anything to say about it, it's perfectly possible to be practically 100% straight, identify as 100% straight, and then fall for the one same-sex person that happens to be an exception to the rule. It happens. It's perfectly legit; love is love, even when you are surprised by the gender of the person you love.
My partner (cis hetero dude) is the same way  🥰 he's such an amazing ally. He likes to say he's 85% straight
may I have a sip of this feel good juice? I tried to have a similar discussion with my ex while i was questioning and he said he would never be anything than straight and it made me really question if i wanted to be seen as 100% female. This right here is good shit.
I jokingly tell my husband he’s “at least a little gay” because of me being non-binary too lol
I also have a cis straight boyfriend and he always says he is glad I'm nonbinary. Says that even though he's only attracted to AFAB people physically he works better with more masculine leaning personalities. It works very well 😁❤❤
Love <3
I literally was JUST having this conversation with friends the other day. 

I love the response you got <3
There’s a possibility he’s questioning his sexuality already
That is one man who is confident in his identity. Send him our love!
Omg this is so cute 
My ex did not do any of this when I came out to him, and this just shows there are better people to be with. So sweet- happy for you and your partner ♥️
This is so wholesome and I absolutely love it!
I’ll probably be downvoted for this. It’s a cool initial reaction from your partner, but just be ready for a let down like all cis people are capable of when interacting with non-binary/trans people. 

As a nb in an 8 year relationship with a cis person, it’s just something you have to be prepared to work through. Not saying you can’t! Just be ready for it when the time comes. Good luck!
My partner (cishet) is also the same way. We some lucky enby folks
Awww! This is so sweet and loving!~ ⇛>ω<⇚
This is so wholesome and amazing, I am so happy for you :)
Your partner is absolutely adorable, this is the best way to react!!
This is how it should be ♥️
YOU'RE DATING GUY FIERI?!? 😍😍😍😍😍
I totally accept that my husband is straight. I just know that I'm his exception. :) We joke all the time that hes gay though lol
I hope that you and Guy Fieri are very happy together.
Hecking wholesome!
I just recently came out as NB masc leaning to my cishet bf and he acted the same way. Congrats to having an amazing partner as well!!
Love it 😊
This was pretty much my SOs response. I was telling her how I understand that she is attracted to me sexually because of my male body but that’s not really how I feel inside (she considers herself straight). She said that she loves me for who I am, what ever I am and, in her words “if being in love with a queer makes me queer then that’s what we are”.
Love is love, it's that simple.
I like to joke about that sort of thing with my boyfriend too, but we have a different take away with our relationship:
No, this relationship is not straight, it’s queer (guy x enby). 
But yes, he’s still straight. This is because I only come out as nonbinary 2 years into our relationship. He’s not SUDDENLY GAY OR BI, he’s just attached to me. We figured that for him to be considered bi or something like that, he would need to find at least two other nonbinary(or otherwise not girls) people attractive. It being specifically two others is for consistency: once (me) or twice is just an exception, but three times is a pattern.
I’m so glad I’m just gonna date girls. They usually tend to be more understanding so I’m glad I can dodge some bullets :)
I came to say the exact same thing!! Props to you both for being so confident in yourselves, your own identities, and your relationship. 

One huge insecurity of mine is dating someone who identifies as 100% gay or 100% straight because I’m not sure if I’m secure enough in my own identity as non-binary that I would be sure that they didn’t see me as a specific gender. I admire you both for being so confident and open with communication!
May I just ask, why the snails? Because they're hermaphrodites?
I knew I wasn't the only one to notice the contact picture. 😂😂
I mean, gay is already a catchall and bi in today's terms usually is taken to mean same and others (not male and female - many bisexual peeps will be very staunchly firm about it not meaning male and female)!
Well, bisexual can't rly lose it's meaning since it actually doesn't rely on the gender binary, contrary to popular belief.
Yup. Give it like 50 years TOPS. 🐆✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻✌🏻
I personally include non binary in straight as I consider hetero to just mean “anything other than what you are” but I know most people don’t think of it in the same way.
*ahem* it's Omni. Bi and hetero are both Latin. Pan is Greek. No need to mix stuff and make it confusing by using languages folks aren't familiar with. :)
I've heard so many straight men say they would make exceptions for Sean Connery that I'm sure this is true.
I feel this a little too much even though my partner is bi and polyam! But she is used to me being ""manly"" I think it is horse crap but if I knew what I was years ago I might have come out earlier
No haha I just like snails
I guess that's fair, and lesbian can have a relatively fluid, inclusive meaning as well. Guess the only word that really needs to be retired is straight
Staunchly firm NB bisexual here to confirm!
Idk, as a transfemme with a strong attraction towards fem-coded things and zero attraction towards masc-coded things, that still doesn't really leave me much to easily describe my sexuality. Lesbian just doesn't work for me for whatever reason, but I'm sure as shit not straight.
Fair :) 🐌
The straights need to be retired ahahaha. 

(nah i've got a lot of v. sweet straight friends but the phrasing made me laugh so I had to say it!)
Staunchly firm non-binary who hates that society understands the term bi to mean two and self-confessed non-binary people use a binary term to describe themselves.

Language has meaning, people! Time to update your labels. You'll still be you, I promise.
🐌 snails are the best 🐌
Maybe just let people identify as they see fit... bisexual doesn’t mean “cis men and cis women only”....
The terms bi and pan both have annoying baggage honestly. Bisexual has clinical origins and in terms of roots upholds a gender binary but pan is constantly defined to mean “I’m willing to date a trans person” (which is othering and possibly degendering to trans people) or “gender is entirely irrelevant to how I experience attraction, I have no preferences whatsoever” (which isn’t true for many people, especially in regards to stuff like wariness of men or ongoing struggles with internalized homophobia .) Plus pan doesn’t have bi’s connection to a shared history. People should choose what’s right for them in regards to gender and sexuality imo not conform to anyone’s ideas of what’s most radical and genderfucky.

I use them both interchangeably or together (as in “I’m bi/pan)
Me too! Bi means ""two"" not ""two or more."" If I tell someone I'm bilingual they know I mean I speak two languages, not ""two or more"" languages.
staunchly firm bi here currently questioning their gender and the fact so many of our labels and terms have overly clinical, exclusionary or otherwise oppressive origins is such a shame due to the issues it causes.

labels are personal and as long as the meaning behind them can be communicated when needed (such as when dating) it doesn't matter too much to me.

personally, bi means attraction to ""same and other genders"" to me whereas i see pan as ""attraction regardless of gender"". i don't know if i'm attracted to all genders but i do know that i'm attracted to those similar and different to mine and that gender itself does play a role in my being attracted to someone and how i experience that attraction. people who id as pan and find that gender plays a role in how they experience attraction even if they're attracted to all genders are still valid as that's their experience and not mine
No, it does not, but there is a strong implication and the holding up of the idea of a gender binary.

People can call themselves whatever they want. They might also be inaccurate - or offensive to others.
At the end of the day I use both and tend to just say “I’m attracted to all genders”.
I do try to make this point understood to others, but I am sad to report that this is basically a feelings thing for the self-identified bisexuals who are into more than two genders. The number of downvotes you got alone says a lot about their feelings on the matter and is completely unrelated to the factual explanation here.

I sense closets and denial. This thread has helped me understand that this is why the topic gets so much disdain. To me, these are descriptors, not identities. Labels are like patches on your jacket. You can change that shit out if you want.
It's Omni, not pan, like it's bi not di. Latin vs. Greek. There's reasons the phrase is ""it's all Greek to me"".

Anyway! Since we all agree that hetero means ""other than"" and homo means ""same as"", we can say that a) Latin prefixes have pre-established, thousands of years old meanings that no one argues with or disagrees about - except for people who like to call themselves bisexual, but don't accept that bi=2 and b) the majority of literate, English speaking people understand the concept of the basic prefixes - cos I dunno about your school, but Latin prefixes were taught in first grade in mine to speed the process of learning English, since they're so widely used in forming compound words. Since we can agree that there are more than three genders, ""my gender and everything that's not my gender"" isn't bisexual. I don't know how many sexual that is to tell you if it's tetra or octo or whatever sexual, but when it's more than two, it's not bi.

This isn't me telling you what your sexuality is, I'm only arguing about numbers. Cos 2+2 isn't ""4 or more"", it's 4. Because two=two - or in Latin bi=bi and bi+bi=quad. This is basic counting and arithmetics, which is ironically a word derived from Greek. (Double ironic because irony is also Greek-derived.)

Tl:Dr words mean stuff, damnit! If you don't like them, that's cool, make a new word.
I have definitely been noticing a bit of a tend towards a reframing of bisexuality towards being more NB inclusive. Which is great! Sure ""bi"" implies ""two,"" but I'm open to seeing what that ""two"" refers to change in the collective consciousness over time, as language tends to.

I frankly may have a somewhat shallow understanding of the terms, but the impression that I've gotten from bi and pan identifying people seems to indicate the primary difference is in attraction towards external vs internal qualities, respectively. I'm sure that's a bit of a simplification, but the fact that the two have differing, useful descriptive qualities helps to justify their continued usage.
I tend to see it as “internal vs external”, like you said. I’m attracted to all kinds of bodies, no exclusion. My pan friends tend to start with “I’m in love with the mind regardless of gender”. 


Either way, the Oxford dictionary’s definition is: a person who is sexually attracted not exclusively to people of one particular gender. 


It’s also the first definition that pops up when you google, asides from many LGBTQ+ resources that reiterate “sexually attracted to any gender” etc. 


I get why it’s frustrating for some who see it as a “binary” term, but majority resources don’t point to it being that. It seems silly to police others labels in the name of “Correct English” when it’s what we are constantly fighting about for pronouns as well.

Edit: misspelled a word
While it is true that language changes over time, the core problem here is the attempt to change the meaning of the prefix bi for exactly one term only, where it is otherwise used through language as it is intended. Bi- as a prefix is literally thousands of years old in the English vernacular.

The desire to capture and redefine a label is understandable, but massively misguided. Regardless of some VERY new articles and additions to online dictionaries (I promise you an older print version says nothing about anything other than men and women), the prefix bi- is deeply embedded and universally understood in our language as 'two'. Now, I definitely agree with its use for people who are attracted to exactly two genders - any two genders.

However, I don't try to go to three semiweekly meetings or to a biweekly meeting more than every other week. Why not? Because those prefixes, bi- and semi- have finite, numerical meanings which are universally understood.

So you like the label bisexual. Great! But what happens when you have outgrown your label? When you were a raver (pretend you were), but realized that's not really your style anymore, did you keep calling yourself a raver and just explain yourself every time that you told someone you're a raver, but don't really do all those things, even though you still use that label... Or did you go find a new label that is truer to who you are now?

Sure, one label (bisexual) is comfortable and more widely accepted in society. It's basically because it doesn't get into the wonderful world of non-binary and trans persons that it is so widely accepted vs. other labels. There are, in fact, many bisexual people who believe in and uphold the gender binary, staunchly call themselves bisexual, and muddy your already murky waters for redefining bi- in this exact instance only.

I don't believe in gatekeeping, which is basically what you're accusing me of here. My partner identifies as straight, though they flirt with me in all of my modes and talks about my non-factory installed parts more than I do. I find that to be very confirmational, validating, and sexy. I still don't correct his choice of label. 

However, they're also not trying to redefine heterosexual to mean 'I'm this gender and I'm into other genders... and my own gender as well'.

That would seem to be incorrect, wouldn't it? Once adding your own gender back in, we basically can agree that they have ventured into the realm of bi or omni sexuality, can we not? There's already labels for those things, there's no need to try to change the meaning of a word just because you're sentimentally or socially attached to the label. This is simply a classic form of denial.

In this case, as a non-binary person myself, the denial feels like a denial that I need to be specifically included, rather than explained to or about. Clinging to bisexual and desperately trying to convince the world that it includes non-binary people also is a lot more effort than simply saying 'yeah, I'm into everyone, regardless of gender', for example. I'm positive that there are other preferences out there as well outside of hetero, bi, homo, and omni sexual. However, each of these designations have meaning, which we all accept - except for the bi people who are in denial.

Ask 10 straight guys what bisexual means. I would wager that none of them suggest anything other than men and women in their answer. I've spent some time doing the same and haven't gotten anything other than the predictable 'that person is into men and women'.

This is a larger debate about labels, clarity, inclusion, and world view from the outside looking in. It is also a question - why is it painful, undesirable, or whatever hesitation you have to fully embrace 'I'm into widely accepted genders AND non-binary people as well' as readily identified by your choice of sexuality labels? What prevents you from claiming out loud, publicly, that you're into us? I see this whole 'bisexual, but really poly or omni sexual' thing as a new closet to live in, for comfort in the outside world.

Closets are where my clothes live, not me."	dmxo76	NonBinary	787	1.0	2019-10-25 13:45:56
Tomorrow I am going to speak in front of the City Council and ask that they add gender identity to our human rights ordinance. We were the second city in the U.S. to add protections for sexual orientation in 1976.		"Omg thank you for your service and for actively fighting for our rights!! I hope that you get the recognition that you deserve and that it went well! P.S. you look fantastic!
Good luck!
That's so awesome! Good luck!
Hope all goes well! Good luck!
Love this look!
Aw hell yeah! I'm a random enby stranger, bit I'm super proud of you for doing this!
Also love your hair - that volume is excellent!
Best of luck to you, friend. I'll be thinking of you.
GOOD LUCK! What you're doing is history in th e making! You got this! 💙💖💌💖💙
Yaaaaas!! You’re fabulous!
You look great! Best wishes tomorrow & keep fighting the good fight. :)
Good luck!!
GOOD LUCK!!! WERE ALL WITH YOU
Thanks for your support, friend. I too am hoping it is well received. We have a large LGBT population here mostly do to being a college town, so I am feeling really positive about it!
I just got back from the council meeting, and both the Mayor and Deputy Mayor as well as three other councilmembers responded after my comments that they support having a study session to address my proposal. The Mayor also said that she did not even realize that the ordinance was so woefully out of date. So it sounds like they are open to working toward a solution. Very exciting!
Thank you so much!
You are very kind, thank you!
I really appreciate your support and kind words :)
Aww, I'm blushing now :D
Thank you. I'm going to be proposing that nonbinary and gender nonconforming people also be included in the civil rights protections, which I think will be extra nice.
Thank you so much, your support certainly means a lot to me!
Awww, that's so nice of you. I really do appreciate that!
I will certainly do my best, and knowing I've got so much support I'm feeling very positive!
Wow! Thanks, it means a lot to have so much support!
That's very exciting! If you have the time/energy/desire to do so, I would love to hear an update on how it goes after the fact! I'll be sending good energy and loving vibes your way! We're all rooting for you. ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Yaaay! I'm so so glad to hear that!! The Mayor sounds like a wonderful person and it's great to hear that everyone responded affirmatively. Because of all of the really horrible things, it's easy to forget that in some ways America is a great place to be! Thank you for making this country a little better for all of us. I aspire to contribute like you do!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Sure thing! I also just noticed with all the excitement, I made a typo in the title :) We were the third city (second was our sister city on the other side of campus) and the ordinance was actually passed in 1977. Just wanted to make sure I got that clarified!
Wow! Crazy that your campus spans across two cities! Thank you for clearing that up. :^)"	cmf84h	NonBinary	765	0.99	2019-08-05 18:58:06

Cis people understand how gender identity works challenge (100% impossible)		"""They're too young to know themselves!"" But no one would be saying that if someone was identifying by their agab. Aren't they too young? Or is it just with us?
Teenagers are still finding themselves and their identity and could change their mind, but that's okay.  We shouldn't discourage people from trying things out just because they might find out later they're something else. When I was a teenager I believed I was a binary trans person, which I realized later didn't really describe my experience with gender. All I knew then was my AGAB didn't feel right to me.
I knew (kind of) long before non-binary was even a term.  It was kind of a thought in the back of my mind.  Kids are exploring mentally.  It's OK they are exploring; they are exploring so many different things.
""They're too young""

""I'm in my 20s""

Ah, so that decade of experience really set in, huh?
""They are too young to know for certain"" - so let them experiment and try out different things. There will be no better time to experiment with as few strings attached and even if they find out that they are not, was there any harm done?
Bruh. We’re all babies when our genders are assumed and chosen for us. So.
“They’re too young to be exposed to this” say the same people who fucking bury them in gender stereotypes as soon as they’re born.
So they didn’t realize they were cis until they were an adult then either? Or realize they liked the opposite sex as an adult. 

Whenever it’s not cis or straight being a child is ‘too young to know yourself’, but asking an 8 year old girl if she has a boyfriend yet is totally okay? Got it
If they're not old enough to know they're enby, they're not old enough to know they're cis either.
I don’t get the argument “14 year olds identify as non-binary and they don’t even understand themselves yet!”

I mean, did you understand them 10 seconds after they were born and assigned them to one of two classes based on their tiny baby genitals? Idk, I trust the 14 year old a lil more on that topic
People crying that kids are too young these days to really know but then turn around and will tell that same kid that they ""never had the signs"" when they were younger and that they didn't try ""hard enough"" to be trans/gnc 🤡 same stuff my parents pulled on me
I was raised as a girl and since I was approximately 10 I knew I wasn't a girl and I was right. 12 years later I still feel the same and I'm on T for almost 2 years. Best decision of my life.
Every time someone says 'this is just my opinion' I immediately get my hackles up. This is a relatively polite comment all things considered, but .. urgh. Like people have more eloquently said already: if you're too young to know youre non-binary, you can't know you're cis either.

Something something fitting the common mold, something something queerphobia, something something- yeah.
I am an 18 y/o enby and it started to be clearer to me that I am bi when I was 14. However, I already had *childhood experiences* that led me to the realization of my gender and sexuality. And let me tell you, it is absolutely heartbreaking to be told ""it's just a phase"" ""it's because of social media"" or ""you're too young"" by an adult whom you especially trust because all we ever want is someone to BE THERE as we process our identity at a young age. And *if ever* it was a phase to begin with, please, *dont shame the child for it*. Be PROUD of them for exploring who they are. In the end, if the adult were a parent, choosing to be there as they process would strengthen your relationship them. Trust me, they will love and thank you for it.
„They don’t know themselves yet!“ - Buddy, you’re the one telling them that it’s wrong to know themselves
If they’re too young to know they’re trans or non binary then they’re too young to know they’re cis. But they’d kick off if we said that. How the fuck does it affect them if some of their sisters friends are non binary?
No trans where I grew up and still am NB . It’s how we are born
All the other things they are exposed to and I was exposed to when I was 13 and 14 in a very sheltered, isolated household. But what they feel inside about themselves is too much for them and they are unable to work it out and shouldn’t??? The biggest pile of steaming excrement. At that time I was so unsure about everything to do with me. I wasn’t allowed to make sense of things? That poster can go to hell. God damn it
I’ve known since I was 13/14 and am 21 now lmfao these people are the exact reason I didn’t come out
It’s the most benign and lovely “phase” for a kid to go through. I think it’s great kids are open to it.
When I was in high school I felt very ostracised from my Male friend groups because I felt like I don't understand them quite well, even though I'm supposed to be one of them. And I enjoyed spending time with women because I felt I could connect with them easier, yet there was still something that wasnt quite there because I was pretty sure i wasn't a woman But if I had any idea back then that this is how i felt then i would have felt a lot more comfortable in my own skin being who the fuck I am. Cis people.weird me out sometimes with how little they understand.
Ironic that modern psychology argues that our psychological foundations become kinda cemented around 12/13, yet no one wants to give 13 year olds the agency to know and trust themselves. I didn’t figure out I was non-binary until a decade later, but I for sure knew by that time that I was queer! Kids are people too and will one day be adults (but those adults are just stretched out kids pretending they have it figured out!)
This reads like when my nearly 80 year old grandfather said he wouldn't want a drag queen reading a book to a kindergartener because ""They're not ready for that"" but would be fine with Dolly Parton reading a book to a kid.
Exactly. If you don’t know yourself yet why make a decision?
If at the age of 12 someone explained to me what non binary was and I was informed on it I’m sure I would’ve identified as it from a young age. I’m glad kids are learning about it and having the freedom to explore who they are at a younger age. Why should we wait until we’re 18+ to start figuring ourselves out ?? I would’ve been a way happier way less confused kid if I was given that freedom.
i don’t really think “kids” are too young to know. my friend who is trans came out as an adult (20 years old) but he knew he was trans in 8th grade ( about 13 or 14) i think people just feel more comfortable in this time to come out earlier instead of hiding it. and that’s not to say that some kids really don’t know tho, and that’s okay too, life is all about growing up and finding out who you are
37 now, didn't have words like genderqueer or nonbinary until I was 27, but if you gave me the OPTION when I was 15??? If I'd been educated and given an understanding of how gender and sexuality really work, I probably would have opted in back then, even though it would have been hell for me at the time. XD
bestie do you think I've chosen this identity on purpose
also like…… gender identity can fluctuate? like it just isn’t a big deal. what does saying you’re non-binary and going by they/them pronouns do to hurt someone? nothing! if they discover they’re not non-binary, find a better label, or their expression changes…. it shouldn’t be a big deal. kids are kids. let them do what they want if it doesn’t hurt anyone. same with adults lmao
I mean... They're just further proving the point that asking kids to have a defined gender at that age is messed up. Non-binary kids are actually the ones who admit they can't conform to a gender yet, or ever. It's actually quite healthy
i thought the text above was an actual post in the subreddit and was ready to throw hands
r/trueoffmychest go 10 minutes without posting something insanely bigoted challenge (100% impossible)
But when they decide they're their agab, they aren't too young?
I knew by 4th grade I was gay. It took a while to figure out I was nonbinary but I never really liked being a girl so.... Yeah I think kids can know pretty young what their sexuality is and their gender identity.
It’s funny to me how many cis adults are concerned about kids / minors finding their gender identity, as if it’s an issue that will disrupt their development rather than a journey of self discovery. But they aren’t concerned about the way statements like “well you’re too young to know yourself yet” have on the development of kids / minors. All it does it teach kids to doubt themselves, their own judgement and ability to make decisions, not just as young people but for the rest of their lives.
But we tell kids all the time about how they should act and be based on their assigned sex at birth. How is that any different? Straight cis people don't realize that all the time and it's frustrating
I wish i had the resources and support to come out before i hit puberty- if youre not old enough to determine your own gender youre DEFINITELY not old enough for puberty.
I know this isn't the space for it cause chill you know; but like its super easy for people to go through life not understanding since alot people just don't think about it. It sucks but ignorance often doesnt fix itself
stuff like this is very funny, because while knowing as a child is definitely not a requirement or anything for being nonbinary, i did. i’ve had these feelings about gender since before puberty. I always knew I wasn’t a girl but I knew I definitely wasn’t a boy-so I had to be a girl, anything else didn’t make sense. it was only when I learned the language for these feelings that it clicked
Sorry. By this logic your kid is too young to determine what their AGAB is. And what's the point of gender reveal parties when the kid is just a baby? They don't know their gender as a baby, why force one on them?
I love that they’re apparently too young to know something they’re intimate with and live with 24/7 but all these abstract concepts like interest rates, global warming, ancient histories? Nah, they can understand that!
Even before I had a word for it, I knew I wasn't my agab. Ive known since I had a sense of self. I just didn't know the words to describe it. Still don't completely today.

My friend has been asking me for help with her sisters kid, cuz my friends sister has just supported one through transitioning but is confused why the other is struggling with gender identity too. So I've given my friend resources (including this sub) to read through with her nibling so they can have places to talk in.

No one is too young to know themselves, their just too young to know the words. I think we should all be happy that kids are able to find the words to describe themselves at young ages. Im in my mid-20s and still trying to work myself out. I wish I'd known the words when I was younger
This sounds like a friend of mine a bit. I think it's absolutely not from a place of hate, but a place of concern and misunderstanding of this topic. It's hard to understand for some people (myself included when I try to understand my own gender), and they don't really know what it constitutes or how people express it and it can get hard to learn without someone helping you out.
nonbinary 15 year old here. ive identified this way since i was 12 i still have people telling me im wrong, or ""too young to know myself"". which i know isn't a long time in the grand scheme of things, but i started puberty when i was 12 and im pretty sure if ive been feeling dysphoric ever since i started ""becoming a woman"" then im not a goddamn woman. but if i was a female then it would be perfectly okay?? the double standards for cis people and trans/nonbinary people irk me.
Children are inherently nonbinary. Until you go through puberty your brain literally doesn't have a gender except the one given to you by nosey parents and gendered advertisements. You don't even have a sex until puberty, primary sex characteristics are exclusively your genitalia and no one should be looking at children's genitalia.
I wish I had known about non-binary identities at that age. I knew something was up but couldn’t figure it out.
No doubt this person was pretty confident they knew their own gender as a teenager.
And what does it matter? If a kid says they're non-binary when they're 14 and realise they're not actually and decide they're cis when they're 18, does it matter? The kid was exploring their gender, and if they turn out to be cis, that's normal too.
I would have loved to know the term non-binary when I was a teenager. I went through a lot of pain and anxiety for years because I couldn't figure out ""what I was"".I was attracted to both girls and guys, so I thought ""bisexual?"" but that didn't explain why I wished I'd been born a boy or identified with male characters all the time. There just wasn't the language yet. I would have immediately used this label for myself.
I dont get when people say shit like this, how tf do you think kids figure out about themselves? Every teenager goes through ""phases"" thats literally their whole thing and thats precisely how they discover who they are.
why do they insist we have a very long ""trial run"" in our AGAB? ""try it, you might like it"" is such an annoying reason to hold back any bit of queer we are, whether it's gender or sexuality. cis straight ppl need to just let us be open about ourselves.
I wish I'd been exposed to more when I was younger. I regret not discovering my gender identity in my teens...
When I was 14 I came out as bi. At 21 I was a lesbian, 24 a trans man, and at 28 I've finally figured out I'm nonbinary bisexual. I was allowed to explore my sexuality and gender until I actually found myself and was comfortable in who I am. If I was never allowed this freedom to experiment to begin with, I would still be a miserable person, still in a body and mindset I didn't like. Let kids figure things out themselves. Life doesn't always have immediate answers for everyone right out the womb, and I think that's the point some people miss. You have to discover these things for yourself, and only you know what's comfortable and right with your sexuality and identity.
i learned the term in ninth grade. one year later and the dysphoria’s hitting harder than ever. also i’m being denied hrt (in one of the most progressive cities in one of the most progressive states, mind you) because i’m not binary trans.
I was 37 years old when I finally had the right words to identify with. Something I have learned is that gender doesn't reflect our physical bodies. I know alot of people who disagree with this because they grew up in a society where gender is only suppose to reflect their bodies and they identify with that cis gender. I grew up constantly wondering why I liked and felt differently from girls and why boys fit better. I was told I was a tom boy, because I didn't like girly things, but I did like girly things I played with Barbies and Hot Wheels. My family, friends and society enforced gender on everything cloths, toys, sports, hobbies, careers, chores and even colors. When someone knows they aren't what society says they are but don't have something to identify with they can start to feel inadequate. They loose confidence suffer from depression feel the world is against them. I always hated the phrase ""when you're older you'll understand"" or ""when you're older you'll feel different"" or ""when you're older ect..."". I never changed I just hid myself away to ""fit in"". No one should have to do that to survive. If I had known gender was more then what society said when I was a kid I would have come out as non binary around 5 years old. That is how early I knew I didn't fit to the structure this society said there only was. I hope this society can change with time. I know it's working its way there, but it still has a long way to go. Sorry this ended up such a long rant I really only meant to type the first sentence. lol \^\_\^
lmao ""they don't even know themselves,"" but they are the only ones who are themselves, and you think you know them better than they do? nah brah.
""They are too young to know""
""If they really were, they would have known since they were young!""
If you think someone is old enough to know they're cis but  not old enough to know they're trans...that's an issue in cognitive dissonance lol
okay, i immediatley do not trsut anybody who so openly talks about their siblings ""developing bodies"" 

that IMMEDIATLEY makes my skin crawl, minus the transphobia.
Cis people are too young to know their gender!! society should stop forcing gender on people who are too young!!
It's amazing how many kids/young teens say they say they are cis they don't even know themselves 

I think some people need to switch it around and hear themselves maybe then they'll realize
If gender is a social construct, once you demolish the construct, people grow free from it and adopt forms that would have seemed impossible under the construct. The person typing this was living under the construct.
yeah, but that is exactly why they should be allowed to experiment and start introspection. It is normal to "" go through phases"" just as normal as understanding oneself better with time. It's literally a processes of getting to know yourself and what feels good for you.

BTW i am 32 and came to terms with me being nonbinary 8 years ago so ...  i guess who knows whats going to happen to this young 20 yo maybe they need to think more about themselves than about others.
I mean, I sort of know what he's saying bc a lot of kids do kind of go thru phases of finding themselves, but if identifying as nb helps them out I don't see why not :) when I was growing up I thought for sure I was trans. I started binding my breasts and dressing like a dude, but then sometimes I wanted to be fem.  I was so confused.  Now I know I'm nonbinary and genderfluid.  I'm not saying it's impossible to know you're nb as a kid, but it could be a phase.  I wish I hadn't done any if the body modification back then.
What’s the harm in exploring your gender while you’re young? Smh the way they frame these statements makes the judgement feel extra judgy. Annoying.
The ""this has never been an issue until recently"" feels a lot like the white people who thought there was no racial unrest in america until Black Lives Matter. 

This has always been an issue. It just never affected you until now. Or until you saw it on the news.
That's How I Felt A Few Years Ago, But Ya Know What, I'm Gonna Say It, Kids Ain't Dafter Than Adults. Well Ok Sometimes They Are, But Like Not In General!
You have to admit there’s some truth to this though. I don’t think you should be dismissive of children, way too many people are, and they know way more than they are given credit for. I remember being frustrated by adults as a child for this reason. But kids do go through phases and they are very impressionable. Those two things are fact in my mind. My daughter said she was non-binary when she was 10 or 11. I didn’t do anything to discourage or encourage it, and I made sure she felt safe and comfortable as much as I could to be whoever she wanted to be. She also more recently started going by a different name (that one hurt a bit as I fought for her name, but of course I happily call her by her new name). Now she is starting to question whether she is actually non-binary. She’s 12 now. I think for all of us adolescence is a time to discover ourselves and the difference now is there are more options that are in focus and that will lead some people into assuming an identity for the wrong reasons or one that may evolve and change.
Really,,all this is stupid. Sorry to say but there's two genders. Either your a boy or a girl that's it. Look down.. if you have a weiner then guess what ?,,,your a boy. If you don't have a weiner then your a girl.
Paging /r/AreTheStraightsOk
But this persons sister is allowed to say shes a girl without flack, im sure 🙄
[removed]
I never fit in and grew up in an overly Christian conservative house. I would’ve definitely identified as non-binary, at a younger age, if AMAB wasn’t forced on me so hard.
i’m surprised that wasn’t from r/teenagers
""These kids are too young to know their true gender, because I'm in my 20s and I still don't understand what gender is. There's no way someone can know something I don't, so I should tell them they're doing it wrong even though I don't even know what they're doing.""  

This person sounds like a real treat
People need to understand that people can and do change, and thats ok.  Maybe they wont be NB when they are ""mature enough"" to understand themselves.  Nobody stays the same forever, and that goes for everything from taste in food, personality, and your sexual and/or gender identity.
To me, not considering the obvious thing that nobody has the right to say to one another ""you don't know yourself, you are not his"" I think that the boost of non binary people is due to the change of values of our society. We are in a time frame unique, in this period we are re evaluating values of our society and it's working, so one thing we are deeply changing is related to gender roles and how we define genders, so it is logical and natural that during this period of changes from one set of values to another, society is in a transitory strange situation where people refuse values of the past (old gender roles and gender definitions) but they, the society, it is still not completely mature in finding and defining a new set of values (regarding genders or anything in general) so lots of people find themselves in the middle.
Not everybody, I just think that genders in general are useless like sexual attraction etiquettes, I think that in nature, in our natural forest habit without social rules technology etc, humans are all pansexuals with this or that preference, but still pansexuals, and gender definitions is actually useless because each humans would act like any other, whatever their biologica sex is. Maybe just the only useful distinction could be done when talking about procreation and who carries the baby and things like these, but other than that, no need to do it.
This means they can’t say they’re a boy or a girl either cause they’re too young to know that too
Their gender identity will change from time to time depending on how they like to present. I wish i have the courage to present in public how I felt inside when I was 13. I still don’t have that courage now
13-14 AIN'T THAT YOUNG, That's when I began questioning my gender (I hadn't been the upmost dysphoria yet). People can know when their toddlers too! There is no fixed age to realize you might not be your agab, Even if it sounds weird.

Also, They are going through adolescents so it makes sense for them to realize some stuff about themselves and how they identify with their surroundings. They may realize that they feel more comfortable or suited to label themselves as something other than what they have being labeled as even if it's a phase.

It's not that shocking when you come to terms with the fact that we have the internet nowadays which has a lot more resources, including a lot more access to these resources. So if one was to question about their identity they could easily do researching using google (Or any other search engine). the terms are more common now too, so a lot of people are going to realize they like the terms better than their previous ones because now they understand they aren't forced into something unsuiting. 

As a society a lot of us are more aware that we don't have to be hyperfeminine/hypermasculine because of our agab. as time continued people could have more significant thoughts regarding their identity of which our past society could not have because of the expectations to display a set of moral coded into our agab. 

The far-right and conservatives don't like the fact that we have these resources so they are trying to restrict the right to learn about lgbtq+ or anything related in school environments which is a shame because that means they shove their propaganda and false-accusations onto even more people. I personally shan't be treated like a lab rat or anything worse so I'm staying away from them at least for now.

Older trans people exist aswell but far less of them for multiple factors including not enough access to resources and having to be forced into roles.
The four or five nonbinary kids and the three trans kids at the school I work for are all friends… maybe that’s why?
""Oh my god, a kid is identifying as non binary, the woe""
there's also the fact that queer ppl stick together more often than not, so it's not unusual for everyone in the friend group to be lgbt+
When I was 15 I draw a separate box when asked for gender. This was in 2006 and no one talked about non binary, and very little about trans at all and if they did was in very misunderstood and stereotyping language.
I don’t like it because I don’t understand, sums it all up really
I'm 37 agab and I've know since I was 12 that I like girls. But I grew up in an extremely toxic religious environment.  My mom was a religious nutjob so there was no room finding out or accepting who I really was.

Took until I was about 26 to completely accept myself and my sexuality. Always had questions about my gender but I thought I was the only one who felt this way.  

Was literally 4 years ago at age 33 that I even found there were other people like me with the same thoughts about their bodies and that I am Non binary. I was born this way but it was my household and society that told me I couldn't be who I am.

This is why I hate that some people are calling it a fad. Yeah, being subjected to hate online, at home or in public is so awesome....They always move the goal posts. They don't want to understand, they just want to feel superior and intentionally make people feel like shit. 

More adults are realizing they're Nonbinary too and but they still have a problem with us. 🤷🏾‍♀️ It's their personal problem,  I'm going to be who I am, idgaf what they think.
I'm sick and tired of these people that think just because your a teen you can't be NB or chose you sexualty, you are never to young to know and those that say stuff like oh there to young to understand have to understand that there not, teens should be treated the same as adults
It's trueoffmycheat, a hive of scum and villainy, you should expect it from that crowd by now
I thought to myself recently, “why aren’t more people non-binary? It just makes a lot of sense“ Then I was like “oh yeah, I’m non-binary so of course it makes sense to me. “
Tbh, I'm 29 and I still don't know. I'm not sure how these 13 year old savants figure it out so quickly
This is why I am afraid to come out
As if no old nonbinary people exist anywhere ever? For a society that is exposed to *everything* via the internet, people sure are ignorant to literally just things and people that exist…
they don't know any of that tho, i can assume their cis judging by yk all of that, and so how should they know what's normal for a trans person to express, cis people love to put their standards on to a group of people those standards don't apply to.
I'm old so we didn't have a word for it, but I knew. I remember reacting with real righteous indignation at the age of about 7 or 8 (one of those I could close my eyes and be back there moments) when someone told me there was no way I could be a tomboy because I didn't like sports. I remember it specifically cuz they got really dogged about it, it wasn't a throwaway comment, they were determined I had my definition wrong and they were going to educate me. Tomboy was the only word I knew that even came close to how I felt so I claimed it and be damned anyone trying to take it from me. At 13 I gave myself a beautiful bathroom mirror bowl cut (it was the worst) and my mother *lost it* with me. I spent most of my teens wondering if I was ftm and then brushing it off because everyone says you just know, whereas I kept flipping back and forth on it. Then I heard the magic words, ""non-binary"" ""gender fluid"" in my 20s and that was my ""I just knew"" moment.

I do think some kids today are probably confused and experimenting or trying to make a statement because non-binary genders have had a fairly sudden rush of visibility and representation in recent years, and there will always be messed up or just plain asshole kids who romanticise being different and decide to try to get a piece of that attention without any of the struggle. It does no one a service to pretend that would never happen cuz those are often the same people making drama and drawing negative attention to the group. 

That said, does that mean it's anyone's right to question anyone else over it? Absolutely not. If it's confusion they'll work it out eventually without your (clearly non-specialist) input. If they're lying to get attention they're in that place where even negative attention is better than nothing, and by giving them crap about this you will only encourage them to keep trying to piss you off with it. If it's real they will always appreciate that you respected them enough to know their own mind. That last one really, really matters.
I didn’t know at the time when I was 10 or 11 that there was other genders then male/female but i knew and been knowing for YEARS that I didn’t fit my gender at birth (female) I am now 23 and use non-binary as my label because I don’t not identify was female but I don’t 100% identify as male I like they/them he/him pronouns because they make me feel the most comfortable and the most like my self 

Things are so much different now with kids growing up with much easier access to the internet but if they are being safe and it not putting them in any  danger I think it perfectly ok with them expressing they are non-binary who knows they might change their minds or they might not but that is perfectly ok as well as people we change our minds all the time 

Only you truly know how you feel no one else can make that call for you again if it done safely and the family is accepting and they are happy let them be kids. Kids this  young start to realize the are different from each other and different body types as well so gender is not the only thing they are bothered with at this age they are just trying todo what kids do fit in they will figure it out
So if you don’t realize you aren’t cis at a young age, you are obviously faking it for attention. If you know at a young age, you are too young and impressionable to possibly think that on your own and obviously we’re manipulated by some agenda to think that. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.
You know a child knows who they are the moment they can think for themselves and vocalize? A good friend of mine knew at the age of 6 he was gay. He has happily been with and married to his husband since 2008, they got married in 2012 and have a beautiful daughter. Why I say this? Because he always knew he was gay. Never dismiss a child and young teen's ability to think for themselves and understand themselves, as well as who they are attracted to. 

I find it so interesting there people in the community are the first to say ""No"" to someone who is discovering WHO they are. After how many times you were told no, you do the same?

I knew long before I wasn't straight. I knew long before I was different. I was all about dresses in elementary school. fourth grade is when I was when I began my tomboy state, still enjoying dresses too, but totally rocked Tomboy. I was 9 in the fourth grade and knew I was born female or male, just didn't have a term to it.

My nephew who is now 4, at the age of 2 knew he loved hairbands, and things like that and happily still to this day loves to wear them. He will rock a headband and play with his Barbies and dinosaurs. He will rock an Ana or Elsa shirt, Moana or anything like that rocking a headband while playing with his dinosaurs. He happily wears a tutu while playing with his doll house that HE asked for. 

Point is, never underestimate a child or teen's ability to think for themselves and express who they are.
well this is just a repeated argument, the ""you're too young too know"" I get if the point is lack of experience but people should be allowed to try things out without feeling like they made a lasting choice

next
I just had this talk with my psychiatrist about my gender identity (he’s helping me get gender affirming surgery) I’ve felt this way since I was a toddler and always knew it, I didn’t understand exactly what it meant but if I had a word to describe the feelings at the time then I would have used it, when I was a teen o found GNC as a description and began using that though it wasn’t a perfect fit so when I gained more understanding of the meaning of non-binary and gender fluid I began using those as more accurate descriptions, if I find something that fits better in the future that label may change yet again. Doesn’t mean I don’t understand my own gender it’s just difficult to explain it to others. In short 13 is *NOT* too young to declare such things. Having this vocabulary earlier and the ability to live genuinely as my gender would have helped me not feel so isolated from everyone I think and it certainly would have helped me out on the days I felt out of control without understanding why, I’ve only recently realized and much of that was due to dysphoria and stress from being forced into the gendered and homophobic boxes of my youth.
im 15 and ive identified as non binary since i was 13, but even years before that i always tried to dress and act like a boy because it made me happier, even though im not a boy i wanted to play with other boys because it made me feel like less of a girl
cis people shut up challenge
I knew when I was 7 or 8 before the term non-binary even existed that I wasn’t boy/girl but something in between. I was on the playground man.
Meanwhile, I'm 35 and too old to come out as non-binary, right?
I’ve known I wasn’t cis my whole life, but I was so afraid of getting judged by assholes like whoever wrote that post that I way overcompensated by being extremely feminine. Now it’s impossible to get people to take me seriously for my identity because “I used to be so girly.” People are who they say they are, regardless of age.
When I was twelve I could conceptualize a binary transition but not a nonbinary one and so concluded that it was my lot to just accept that I would grow up to be a woman despite not feeling like one in the slightest. **I was and am nonbinary**, and the knowledge that such a thing was allowed to exist would have saved me over a decade of avoidance of those thoughts and feelings and struggle resulting from that!

Many, many, many kids begin to feel strongly about their gender the moment they start developing in one way or another, at the start of puberty. Of course 13-14 year olds are acknowledging they're nonbinary! 😖 Ugh, just ugh.
“too young” mf we’re all young, we don’t have any elders bc of the AIDS epidemic. trans people are “getting younger and younger” because the only people alive to celebrate their transness are young.
Yup until youre old enough kids we’re going to force you into a gender.

\*sarcasm\*
I absolutely hate when people play the “you’re too young to know yourself” card, it’s incredibly stupid. Young people aren’t as naïve or unintelligible as society has made people believe
I hate that they're implying that social media influences that. Like no, we all grow up around cis and straight people, but there are still queer people! You can't walk 5 steps in a clothes store without seeing straight people kissing on a poster.
It blows my mind how many kids/young teens nowadays will say they're a ""boy"" or a ""girl"". They don't even know themselves yet! I mean, they're 14, their body is still developing,  they're not mature enough to make such a statement about their gender, in my opinion.  /s  -_-
If they are old enough to decide they are cis they are old enough to decide if they are anything else period. If you don't think kids under the age of 20 or whatever can't know their own gender then I guess everyone should be raised genderless but ofc that's not something we do because we know that kids can know who they are

Edit: forgot to mention that also I don't see the harm in letting a kid explore their gender identity, they won't be making any permanent decisions so if they one day realize they were wrong then they can just.....identity differently *oh the horror of letting your child explore who they are in a healthy, loving way*
So, .... by this logic, those who were assigned male at birth, are too young to say, ""I'm a boy."" And decide that their gender is male. 

BAM!

Think about that for a bit before you spew your self-serving response.
seriously? And here I am saying ""if you are old enough to talk and think you can tell me if you feel like. If you say I am a boy you are a boy, if you say you are a girl you are a girl, if you say you are enby you are enby. Hell if you say you are an alien, well hello superman! same goes for whatever you are attracted to romantically or sexually, if any. As we are growing and changing, our views on ourselves might change and they might not. So just accept it as we all are alive."" (note I say this stuff with my friends when we talk about babies, to kids whom randomly bug me and want to be validated. etc.)
I've been GNC since I was like 5 my parents just tried to push gender on me. Then they wanna be all surprised Pikachu when I come out....
I started questioning my gender at that age but then I ended up repressing because of ✨ transphobia✨ (especially around the topic of kids being too young and related terf rhetoric) causing me to not feel safe  to experiment with or pursue my gender. 

After several years and a lot of unpacking, I'm still trans and now know I'm non-binary. Hiding it all really fucked with me and I'm still trying to unlearn those repressing behaviours. Trying to police how and when kids (or even adults) explore these things is only going to cause these kids to not feel safe enough to be themselves, which ultimately causes more harm in the long run.
I guarantee you they don’t feel the same about teenagers who identity as cis.
My main gripe with this is that even if they happen to be wrong like... so what?
my mom does this too... she thinks that im too young to know myself when i have literally had 3-4 year to think about myself.. (i had some health issues in mid 2019 to late 2021, im better now)
''They don't even know themselves yet''. Yeah, that's kinda the point, they might still not know and that's why they explore identities, options, and it's cool. When I was a kid, I had this feeling I couldn't describe, and when I was an adult, I heard of the term non-binary but never got it. Untill I was 19, the idea started to hit me and then I found myself. Maybe if I had known the term when I was 14, everything could've been easier

It's fine to not know yourself and experiment things. I mean, the kids may be 4 years old and the parents and society imposes gender norms and identity upon them, and that's ''fine'', but experimenting and trying to find who you are is not? Lol
As a mom of a non binary kid this is beyond infuriating that people think like this. The only thing that would have happened if my kid was never introduced to the concept of being non binary is that they would have been miserable and confused. Instead they are comfortable and express themselves freely.
“They aren’t mature enough to make a statement about gender”, so they should just stick to the one someone else assigned them at birth? 🙄😒
yeah we’re young so just let us experiment lol. at least for me i’m only 16 but since learning i don’t have to fit into man or woman my identity’s been roughly the same for 3 years now. i went from non-binary to gender queer to non binary to transmasc to genderfluid. it’s perfectly okay to change and i feel like i’ve finally found the label that fits best. but they’re all just different versions of non binary so i’ll had roughly the same all encompassing label the whole time. idk if this makes any sense but idk man. i’ve been trans for almost 4 years now and i don’t think it’s changing anytime soon :) even if something happens, it will still be okay.
Too young to understand gender, hmmm, by that logic we shouldn't assign a gender at birth at all, just wait until the kids are old enough to understand gender. Or maybe it's not about understanding and logic but about transphobia
Exactly! That's how my mom felt. Her opinion was she should've been able to ""control me"" as a teen. And I was like, mom you know why I had a mailbox right? (I did, at 13 lol) I bought it so I could get girl clothes among other things. And her whole spiel was about how she should've been able to stop me from doing shit she didn't like. That I was exposed to these other transpeople and that's why I'm trans. I was like well, would you have bought me the clothes I wanted? ""No"". And I'm still fucking trans. So I had to. Parents think they are entitled to force us to not be trans and that somehow we'd be less ""fucked up"" if we weren't exposed! All she did is damage me emotionally, have trust issues (since I learned early I had to hide everything about myself and do everything in secret), and permanently damage my self-esteem. We need that kind of exposure, freedom to learn, and be valued and accepted for who we are, and if that changes so be it, but it's *our* decision.
If I had the vocabulary I would have said I was non-binary in middle school. Instead I just felt like a freak.
A lot of folks - especially, sadly, my fellow parents - have a real hard time coping with the idea that children are real people with their own agency. ""They’re too young to know themselves,"" is just a polite way of saying, ""I don’t think kids should be able to challenge the authority that I (or the social power structure that I’ve bought into) am trying to wield over them.""
But that's _obviously_ something totally and utterly different. You see, then they conform with the gender we've placed upon them.

\s
Yup. And, of course, being too young to know themselves means they're too young to figure themselves out. By the time they're old enough to know themselves, they get shamed for not having figured themselves out already.
well that's the thing, conformity isn't a choice and choosing not to conform is obviously something only adults can (but shouldn't) do /s
they say that Also applies but they curiously only intervene in these instances
I knew I was different at 5 years old! I would always wish I was a girl, and it took me until 23 to find myself to be comfortable with myself as a nonbinary person. Having masculinity pushed on me as I grew up in Texas really fucked with my head. I've had lots of therapy since then and still have lots of therapy ahead of me tobqork through all of it.
Well yeah ofc nobody would question that because it’s what they’re *assigned*, it’s in the name. People are generally conditioned to conform to their assigned gender and any steps away from that are considered out of the ordinary which for most people, (usually older folk in my experience,) it is. And I’m sure once we’re all grown up and have kids it’ll gradually be normalised and we won’t be having these issues any more, at least in a perfect world
For real. I come out as trans at 13/14 and, coincidentally, I am still trans a decade later. These people don’t understand that children grow up to be adults, they aren’t a different species entirely.
Yes this is the right thing. It’s ok for kids to be wrong, or a little wrong. Also, they’re probably not wrong.
exactly. 

life is about ""phases,"" nothing is permanent and if someone wants to identify as NB and later as something else, good on u! 

we are constantly evolving and there needs to be room for that.
Bingo, they are acting as if these kids are doing things they can’t walk back. We need to encourage exploration of identity as teens (and adult really) and foster a mentality that is okay to change your mind and try something else.

People reinvent themselves and how they see themselves all the time. Yet gender identity and presentation has remained surprisingly stagnant in society.
Adults say exactly the same for anything a child/teenager wants or does. Hell, they could even be talking about their career choices and all it takes is their relatives not agreeing with the choices to start throwing shit to the poor kid.
Yeah, I thought I might be binary trans until I discovered what nb was, my friend also thought he was binary trans, but suprise suprise, turned out to be enby. We were both wrong, but it's okay, because it helped us realise how we feel and explore more about ourselves. So in my opinion, let the teens go wild, even if they realise it wasn't who they truly are, it's important that it helped them discover their true identity in the process.
Phases are good! We should be free to explore,,,

""phases"" are a bullshit phrase meaning ""but you're wrong tho""

&#x200B;

All Phases are correct in the moment, and all phases might be ""the final one""… its only when thhey say ""its a phase"" implying ""it'll go away for sure I somehow know that about you,,, in fact NONE of the features of it will even stay, you'll reject every part of it OBVIOUSLY"" 

Then they're a piece of shit
galaxy brain take
To add to this, when I was growing up I didn't know non binary was a thing till I was about 14. Before then I always knew I wasn't my AGAB. I tried using the ""opposite"" pronouns several times as a child but they never stuck. When I learned I was non binary I was SO amazed and overjoyed that I finally found myself. A lot of my past experiences suddenly made more sense. (I enjoyed both variations gendered toys, didn't fit in with any groups growing up, ect)

Their opinion that kids that age don't unstand their own gender is blatantly incorrect. My story alone can prove that (Knowing I wasn't Cis since the age of 3)

I have seen a few people go from trans binary to non binary and vis versa and that's okay! It's all about self discovery. 

As for the opinion young teens shouldn't be exposed to lgbtq+, specifically non binary in this case, it is an opinion yes, but to me it seems wrong. When I first learned about it I was so confused and my first reaction I hate to admit, was hateful. This is a typical reaction to something one don't understand. The more I thought about it, however, the more I wanted to learn about it and would you look at that? Bam. I realized finally that I was non binary. Education of lgbtq+ topics is known to have a positive impact on kids and teens alike so to me that's disregarding the facts or simply being unaware of them.

Another reason ""so many"" teens and tweens are coming out as LGBTQ+ is because today's enviroment is a lot more accepting that it used to be and thus many feel safer to come out. There's definitely still a lot of work to be done towards more acceptance, however. (Southern USA cough cough)

That's all I got on this. Felt like dropping my opinion seeing as this is contradicts my experience growing up. I know they weren't trying to be hateful but yeah, it is a somewhat harmful narrative to push in a positive light.

(Whoops didn't mean to make this post so long) Thanks for reading this far if ya do!
My life would have been so much less neurotic had I been allowed to properly work out my identity as a kid, rather than being forcefully crammed into the mold that someone else arbitrarily chose or me, and not coming back out of my shell until I was middle aged.

It’s amazing how quick people can be to rationalize violence against children as somehow protecting them. Patriarchy is a hell of a drug.
I told my then boyfriend I felt like a tomboy when I was about 20. He said I wasn't because I wasn't dressed like one or acted like one. So I assumed I was not a tomboy but being a girl/woman also didn't feel fitting. Only after someone in my acqaintance group started (binary -afaik) transitioning I started to wonder what made me a woman. I figured the fact that I wasn't a man made me a woman. Fortunately the internet existed and tought me there were so many other options. Basically the same as me thinking I'm straight because I'm into men so I can't be into women, only to meet someone who is bi and two months later seeing this hot ice skater on tv and suddenly realising I had been having a huge crush at camp girl the summer before. Giving people knowledge about options can help people find themselves, even if that encompasses trying out different labels while finding the right one.
I knew the ""I'm only 23 but I fucking know everything"" line was coming. Just the perfect encapsulation of a life that has never been told they were wrong before.

Meanwhile, I'm over here like ""what the fuck is 40 year old me gonna think???? They're gonna have live with this shit longer than I do""
[deleted]
>""They are too young to know for certain""

 My ex would say this more or less word for word about younger people identifying as ace which is equally bullshit. It was especially bewildering because they were pretty passionate about their beliefs and I ended up getting shouted down about things I said that they didn't like more than once.
No better time! That’s right!
""they're too young to be exposed to this!!!!!"" your literal baby son is in a shirt that says ""The Ladies Can't Resist Me"", maybe there are some bigger problems here SHARON.
My half-brother is 7 years old, and family were already calling his several girl classmates his ""girlfriends"" when he was 4-5. But they keep telling me, a 25 yo who is very firmly non-binary Aroace ""oh don't worry, you'll change your mind eventually""/""find someone who will make you see things differently"". Like they don't see the disparity in their comments and actions, and it's honestly disheartening that they'll probably never see their hypocrisy.
Exactly where their critical thinking stops…
I literally told my mom that sometimes I feel like a woman a few years before I sought treatment. When I came out and explicitly told her that I'm trans she said there were no signs. >_<
I never felt like a girl from a super young age and always felt like an outcast because I wanted to be with the boys. It killed me because always felt completely alone and I was depressed as hell. If I knew that transgender was a thing or non-binary was a thing as a kid I would've been able to say with confidence that it was me from even as young as 5 years old!
Even if it was a choice who would want to go through the experience? It could be traumatizing for them if they do end up going through misgendering and hate crimes which are pretty common
this comment does make me wonder how old someone would have to be to determine what is ""old enough"" to have a say in their own identity, by the terms of those arguing in the OP's image
This exactly.  You know there is something but you dont know what is.
It is not the responsibility of non binary people to educate prejudice and bigoted cis people. If op from the Screenshot cared they would go to sub reddits like this one or even google or just ask non binary people directly instead of a sub reddit DEDICATED to ranting about something that bothers you. It isn't our responsibility to educate someone who is bothered by our existence
Me too. I was 35 when I realized and came out to myself. Thirty-fucking-five. And dear God it messed me up for so many years.
Same. I knew that I wasn't, but I didn't have the vocab and that sucked. It hurt having people tell me that it was normal and I needed to, ""Just think positively"" but I've been more positive as an enby.
I'd have said it at the ripe old age of 3 if I'd had the vocabulary.
2-3rd grade is when I really started noticing for myself and I wish I had the language earlier in my life.
Yeah, same here. I wish I’d learned this stuff as a kid.
I wish I'd been exposed to anything trans-specific as a kid. I remember this weird time where I tried to relate to gender....and someone asked if I was gay (I'm amab) and I was like ""no, more like a lesbian"" - I mean close, very close, but that was still me trying to point out gender more than sexuality and not having the exposure to these words....In my teens I knew I was trans but still no ""nonbinary"" word existed (and if it did, noone told me), so I came out and sequentially returned to the closet....for like 10 more years until I decided just to ""do whatever"" without the vocabulary or self-understanding, and 2 years into ""transition #2"" I decided nonbinary was the most appropriate label.  


10 years wasted because even when I learned what trans was, I didn't feel ""trans enough"" because it turns out I'm nonbinary.
(And then an hour later I realized while I was doing the dishes that I only used the words ""children"" and ""kids"" when OP was talking about a 14 year old. Sorry y’all, I realize that’s infantilizing, and plays into the very mindset I meant to criticize.)
Thank you for the ""/s"" because autism brain had me really confused and slightly offended till I saw that. Thanks.
Yesss, thats the point, being able to say i'm NB as children makes the whole process of growing up clearer, i can honestly say i'm having a delayed puberty both physically and emotionally because i only had space for intelectual puberty during my teens. I was forced into a gender i never chose and had to foght for my right to choose my hair leangth without even knowing why that mattered to me. All i could say to myself to comfort myself during school was that i was differant and therefor unique and that was the little bit of self acceptance that helped me get through so much loneliness and shame.
Having a vocabulary like these kids, like i have now and my siblings have now thanks to me helps with queer puberty in ways people shoulden't have to imagine.
Ahh, you mean binary trans! I myself and many other folks are trans-nonbinary, so just letting you know you're still invited to use the term trans if it feels right and always welcome to share donuts in the super secret trans lounge. 😉 Non-cis is the only prerequisite. 💛
When I was a teen I never heard of nonbinary - heck it might not have existed as a word....and sadly this conflict and insufficiency compared to my very binary transmasc friends became invalidation. If only I'd had that same flexibility and exposure they are complaining about I might not have returned to the closet for like 10 more years.
God dayum this comment is life ✨✨✨
>I figured the fact that I wasn't a man made me a woman. Fortunately the internet existed and tought me there were so many other options.

I love the way you phrased this. In my case, I knew for years that I wasn't a ""man"" nor a ""woman"". Neither term fit. Unlike you, sadly, I didn't find the Internet to be a welcoming or affirming place in that process of exploration and self-discovery.

Time and time again I faced judgment, mostly from people who insisted they knew how gender worked better than I do. They tried to force me into a box where I don't belong, instead of listening to what I have to say and letting me define myself on my own terms.
I am in my 30s.
This! How many times do adults ask little kids if they like some in school or have a girlfriend/boyfriend? Like why should little kids be aware of that. They worry about lgbtq+ pushing things on kids but are perfectly fine with how much the push straight and cis on kids.
😷 so sorry for that
Reminds me of how in my family my mother jokes about my little sister having a boyfriend (She did tell me they were dating at one point though) She's around 7-11 (I'm not going to say exact age as that's private information). Yet whenever my mother hears her saying the word gay she tells her not too.

 In my thought process I came to a semi-conclusion If she doesn't know what the word means and it isn't explained to her she could learn a wrong interpretation of what it means so yes she's young but it's better she knows than goes around calling other people it without knowing, Other people her age may not even know what it means so they could even misinterpret it.
Yeah that's just gross...
30 here. When at 30 I *still* didn't feel like a man, I thought something else had to be going on.
39 here. It was a revelation to have a word for what I had been feeling my whole life.
35 here as well. I never knew the words for how I felt til I dated another non binary when I was 35.
36 for me, wasted time and pain.
35 for me as well! I never heard the term transgender until college, and didn’t hear the term non-binary until I was 34. Once I had the words it didn’t take me long to realize it described me. If I had been raised with the terminology I definitely would have identified as non-binary before middle school.
See I don't think so. I think of it as opposite, in fact, because children can and do know themselves, and the problem is people thinking that child=not-self-aware/not-their-own-person-yet. 14y/o IS still a child. A maturing, older child, but still a child. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that :)
Hah, yeah, sorry I should have clarified myself. Imma edit the comment, thanks for letting me know!
I'm so sorry you were met with judgement! To be honest I only used the internet to inform myself and I kept my gender identity very silent irl and on internet at first. After coming out to my housemate which went well and she actually responded really well during a longer period of time, I started to gain a bit trust and told a couple more friends. At some point I joined Facebook groups and started to be a bit more comfortable, and started to defend non binary people in comment sections on news articles. Most times I came out to bigger groups of people actually it was accidental and I'm still quite 'shy' in that way irl.

Indoctrination is fine if it's done in order to promote cisnormativity and heteronormitivity. /s
In general, totally fair.

But, all too often, when older folks refer to adolescents as children or kids, it’s being used as a weasel word that’s meant to call attention to their relative youth in order to devalue their opinions. That’s what the person in the image OP posted was doing, and, in that context, me following that lead instead of calling it out could be taken as legitimizing it.
Why are you defending them for mocking teens in this thread? If that wasn't your intention, that's definitely how it reads. 

(/s.)
Yeah, I can see where you're coming from. But I also think we shouldn't cede them the misuse of the term. Particularly since there are different but equally as dangerous problems with adultifying preteens and teens.
ehh while I absolutely agree kids, even the teenage ones, are not given enough credit as to their intelligence or agency as a person (because children are still people, and they can be smart little buggers) I'm still seen as a ""kid"" to many older adults at 23. it's really not that deep, bud.
i think you meant /srs ahah /s means sarcastic
I agree with you here. They are still kids and they do have much learning ahead of them about bigger world things, and thinking of them as more than that or worse treating them as adults can be a problem. That being said realizing that they’re still children (older children) in no way makes their experience of self identity invalid. Just because they’re kids does not mean they are not whole people and very intelligent. What it does make them is flexible to change as they still have mental growing to do, it’s both their greatest strength and weakness. This flexibility (as a strength) allows them to adopt new mindsets with ease and learn quickly to adapt, but when presented with the wrong information or an adults bias can hurt their growth.

Update(???): Straight cis guy here confused about stuff	"So I made a post about [2 weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/11ywzzw/straight_cis_guy_here_confused_about_stuff/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) wondering about what my attraction to enbies meant. The vast majority of people who replied were very sincere and understanding, and several brought up some stuff I never even considered about myself. It challenged my ideas about my own gender identity.

I was never confused about my sexuality. I know for a fact what the type of person I find attractive/sexually appealing...BUT, I did come out of the post thinking alot about what I defined as my own masculinity.

I definitely don't think of myself as a woman... but I'm starting to wonder if I even ever considered myself as a man. Wether or not it means I feel more comfortable as non-binary or GNC...I don't know. I'm now trying to figure this out.

I just want to say thank you to those who replied, and a bigger thank you to this community in general."	"Hey pal! 

I think I have a similar experience to you and by no means do I intend to imply that a path once made is a path always taken. You are your own person and the things I say are simply signs you can choose to follow if the wind feels right that way. 

My folks are divorced and I grew up with all sisters. Dad wasn’t around much, stepdad was abusive, sisters and mom were my true family. I was raised religious (hate the sin, love the sinner and what not). That upbringing left me with a lot of non conforming ideas, but didn’t let me explore them without shame. I decided I was straight, decided I was cis, that was the game. 

I had always been attracted to queer women. Short hair, wild make up, no make up, butch clothing, piercings, counter culture, every beautiful thing that makes every beautiful person. 

My awakening was actually a guy I worked with. He was really soft spoken, had facial hair, but he was curvy. And I guess it broke something for me. I realized I wasn’t attracted to women, just stuff that women typically had. And I wasn’t NOT attracted to men, just not the stuff that men typically were. I was attracted to femininity and was entirely agnostic towards genitals. 

In the conversation of non-binary people, it would be offensive to tell someone you’re attracted to them because they’re femme. But also it wouldn’t be. And sometimes it would be just a little bit. Love and attraction are allowed to occur organically and off of baseless concepts, but they can and should coexist within communication. If you’re attracted to someone, ask them on a date! If they ask you what you like about them, ask them if there are any words they don’t like being used in reference to them. In the same way a partner can ask you if you’re okay, you can ask them if their personal dictionary has any addendums. 

Labels are confusing. They can help and they can simplify things, but only if those things are simple to begin with. A rose by any other name and all that, but if a rose is suddenly not a flower, what comes next? 

If you don’t feel like a man, and you don’t feel like a woman, and you don’t feel non-binary, then by God, my friend, mayhaps you feel like you. And you can lean into this as any explorer has slashed through forest and found nothing of note. But if you’ve discovered yourself, the nebulous little thing you are, then swing. 

All of this is to say, you can be a rose and not a flower. You can love and be unsure why. And if a darling person asks you what you’re attracted to, there’s no shame in saying “you”.
I’m always glad to hear there are other people like me (well into adulthood) still figuring this stuff out. It definitely helps me feel less alone.
You're quite welcome to spend time here while you figure yourself out, and if you eventually decide this community isn't for you, we won't begrudge you any of the time you spent with us! Good luck on your journey~
Lmao this is actually me🤙AMAB non-binary and Transfemme. I won’t say welcome to the club—do some soul searching and find out who you really are. If at the end of it, you still see yourself as a cis man, that’s perfectly fine too💖
Good luck on your journey of self-discovery! As someone who's amab, masculinity is wild. It can feel like a contradictory mess made out of twigs and hot glue. I hope you find the answers you're looking for
Welcome to the club lol.

Gender and sexuality seem like clear cut things, but really all the categories are blurry and poorly defined which is why I mostly just label myself as queer these days. I once considered myself a lesbian, but really I’m attracted to femininity and there are some nonbinary people and maybe even feminine men who can break all the rules and steal my heart. I have tried calling myself bi, but it feels misleading when I’m not really attracted to straight or gender conforming men so I just stick with queer.

Also, the three times I’ve actually dated someone I thought was a man they’ve turned out to be a closeted trans women, so maybe I’m just really good at spotting women even if they don’t realize it themselves yet lol. I basically have stopped trying to analyze or label it, much better to just connect with individual people <3

I’m lucky to have older queer role models, including a nonbinary man (his term) who had always considered himself gay and ended up marrying someone who always considered herself a lesbian. They are perfect together and I love how they made room for this beautiful queer relationship even though it didn’t match the labels they’d used for the past 30 years.
its kinda freeing when you realize there is no such thing as a ""man"". like, what would you define as a man (genderwise, not arguing sex here)? are any of those gender things you can think of actually scientific, biologically driven stuff? or is it just, a social performance that the world created? is there any reason that some things are masculine and some are feminine? or is it arbitrary? do you have to live in this arbitrary, socially created role? or can you define your own role and personality defined by whatever YOU like? Its kinda like when people realized that religion was not needed to define your personal sense of morality. straying from gender as a guide for personality and expression is just still seen as a very 'new' thing in the west. hope you keep up this exploration and learn to open yourself up to whatever YOU like from the full spectrum of human expression!
That ah-ha moment was exactly how I started to look into my own non-binary-ness. As an afab, I’d never “felt like a man,” but then realized I’d never quite “felt like a woman” either. It was a good first step for me. Best of luck as you delve deeper into your own self-discovery! ✨✨✨
Btw. Just wanna say… If you come out still identifying as a cis man, that is entirely valid. The discussion about gender identity is not to convince you to CHANGE your gender identity, but to convince you to look inside and AFFIRM what your gender identity actually is. Whatever that may be, and if it doesn’t change, then you are still closer to understanding yourself and building that foundation of self awareness and self love. That’s what it’s all about.
I went on that journey, questioning my gender and masculinity, and I came out the other end realizing I was NB/Genderfluid. However, by no means does questioning mean you're gonna end up in a specific place. I think social structures condition all of us, no matter our assigned gender, to perceive ourselves in a specific way, and all people, cis, trans, or nb, go on our own journeys of deconstructing our identities and rebuilding. No matter where you end up identifying, treat yourself with patience and kindness, because you're gonna learn new things, but know you're gonna understand yourself and the world all the more everyday.

Edit: Additionally, on the note of attraction, finding out sexuality and attraction in the midst of that can be difficult too, as our language about attraction (gay, straight, lesbian, bi, etc.) is so often dependent on binary understandings of gender. So similarly, just going with the flow and giving yourself space and empathy is key.
Cis... *for now*

But on a serious note, if you decide you still identify as a cis guy, great! There's no limit on how you can express your gender
Just remember masculinity/femininity doesn’t define a person. Social roles don’t define a person. Too many people get caught up in this sexist thinking and it’s really disturbing. People on the internet will try to tell you what you are based on a lot of arbitrary things without even knowing you too, don’t take them seriously because they really could never know.
I'd just add: it is a-okay to think of this as a fluid process. If you think you might be [insert gender], you have every right to explore it however you see fit. That doesn't even mean doing anything drastic. You can ask a trusted friend to call you by a different pronoun. See how it feels. Reading autobiographies of Non-Binary folks helped me figure it out. You're not doing anything wrong by exploring. I wish more people would feel safe enough to do that tbh
Welcome to the club! Gender is a convenient script that a lot of people are comfortable following. If you don't, all power to you, I hope you have fun with it :)
Hey friend, good for you for being open with yourself! I’ve recently decided I’m agender, definitely an identity to look into for yourself
Echoing what other people have said, but you’re welcome here while you’re figuring stuff out, regardless of the outcome!
Maybe you'll find this relevant: when I came out as nonbinary to my family and started presenting way more masculine, one of my brothers told me something like ""yeah, gender is weird and nonsensical. what does being a man even mean??"" and we had a laugh bc yeah, gender is weird. He is still totally fine with identifying as a man, far as I know, and is deconstructing gender in other ways besides identity. All that is to say, there's many directions questioning can take you, and they are all good! Interrogating gender is good! (also, no rush)
Damn you put what I’ve been feeling lately into words thanks
Same for me out of therapy 3 months ago. I found I didn't not like the masculine/male labels but realized it's something I've never honestly deslth with and on top of a bunch of habits in life of being somewhere in the middle I found my NB comfort zone.
Well, thank goodness there’s some excellent ambassadors out there.
I think its important to rememer that liking ""feminine"" things or ""masculine"" things doest MAKE someone female or male. 

I don't know your specifics, I didn't read the first post. But I see a lot about girls liking sports and cards and getting confused, or men who enjoy baking and fashion. You don't have to let traditionally gendered thing determine what you are. Just do what makes you happy and be who you are happy being. (:
It's important to keep in mind that both gender and sexuality exist on a spectrum and even if you do end up identifying as both straight and cis gender it's always important to introspect yourself and explore a bit about which gender fits you best. If you feel like you're not super male identifying then you might be a [demiboy](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Demiboy) if you feel like you don't have any gender at all you might be [agender](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Agender) if you feel like a bit of both then you might be [libramasculine](https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Libramasculine). These are just suggestions based on your line of thinking. I encourage you to do some more research to better understand what these labels mean and rather or not they suit you. It might take some time to figure out your gender. Most people don't even realize a certain label could apply to them until they do their research and see if they can relate to it or not.
As a AFAB, non-binary and overall very androgynous, just to add something that isn’t fully relatable to this post. Labels are not everything, while it’s nice to find a general idea and have that title that you can find like minded individuals, it can also be very constricting. 
I’m queer, androgynous, but still act and sound very feminine at times, so being called maam or she doesn’t bother me. My partner and family still use my birth name, and that doesn’t bother me. My partner is straight and cis, born and raised ohioan, and has accepted me fully and we are both mutually understanding that we are in a relationship that is het appearing to strangers. 

Long story short, don’t let labels suffocate you.
❤️ Totally with you 💯, from a straight nb-them ex-cisman
Nice!
Ahhh this is lovely !!

That was beautiful to read
Omg this just explained everything for me….
As someone going through a similar thing to Op, I've never felt so seen. Thank you.
😭😭😭😭😭
I came out at 38… it’s never too late

You said that very well! Wise words!
Just afab as far as I can tell.

wanted an allergy test and got my identity denied	"Tw denial of non-binary identities

Wow, didn't expect this but this time when i went allergy testing the (female) doc didn't respect my wish for not being called ""ms/mrs"". Last time, the other doc just called me by my name and it was very affirming. This time all the docs permanently called me female out loud. Very stressful.
..

Not only that. While explaining me my allergies are all psycholohical, she stated that it would be transgenerational trauma and i should come to her systemic therapy to make a systemic allergy ""test"". Then she said, that my allergies are an internalised wish to die and if i would know that.
..

Now the worst: she said ""ah and you can't quite decide what your gender is"", because i have non binary written next to my name in their computer. I told her that non binary is a valid gender identification and my gender is very decided on being non binary. ""You might think that, but we are living in a binary world and it is either this or that. Most people who feel like you have a prebirth or transgenerational trauma. You either identify with someone in your familys past or with an unborn twin. Ask your mother if there were any complications during pregnancy. I can do a systemic therapy session with you, where you can find out and learn to let that identification go. You want to live and you want to live your own life, right? Then you need to find out who you confuse yourself with. You can't be between or nothing, its he or she. Nothing between that is existing""
...

Just needed to put that out somewhere. I will check her systemic certificate and ask my own systemic therapist about her opinion, just to revalidate and reassure myself."	"Oh honey switch doctors. Please for your own mental helth.
Ok as someone who has allergies and has a child with severe food allergies: 1, find a new doctor asap because that’s not how allergies work, and 2, find out who licensed this dr and report them. 

Holy shit. 

But seriously, find someone who specializes in allergies because that “doctor” was making up some weird crap. That’s 110% not how allergies work.
What the hell kind of doctor is this? Seems like they also spew nonsense therapy stuff to me... Very unprofessional and I'd try finding a new one if you can.
“Binary world”??? This person is in the HEALTHCARE FIELD NOTHING IS BINARY THERE
> [She explained] to me [that] my allergies are all psychological […] transgenerational trauma […] Then she said that my allergies are an internalized wish to die […]

Your doctor is batshit insane. Absolutely cuckoo for coco puffs. She is not practicing medicine, she’s actively harming her patients with false understandings of how the human body functions. Report her for BOTH the gender disrespect AND her pseudoscientific nonsense about allergies.
Report that. That's bad medicine, bad science and a &!+<#

I'm sorry you went through such an awful appointment.
Report that asshole. She has no right to say that shit.
OP, that doc sounds like a massive quack. Please switch docs for your own safety
It honestly sounds like this doctor is just trying to weasel more money out of you by convincing you there’s something wrong with your identity and you need her help to fix it. Switch doctors.
Wait, so she’s an allergist? What kind of physician? Why is she pretending to be a psychologist?

This is one of the most fascinating takes I’ve heard in a while to invalidate nonbinary people. “Unborn twin” “transgenerational trauma” “pregnancy complications”… That’s new to me.

Also, fun (not fun) fact: allergy tests have lots of false negatives. Only thing you can trust in an allergy test is a *positive.* It doesn’t mean it’s in your head. Allergy testing is notorious for false negatives.
good lord.  this ""doctor"" has a whole lot to unwind.  

first off, the ""transgenerational trauma"" thing does NOT mean that your allergies are in your head.  Theres some cool studies about that topic, but that does not mean that you do not actually have physical allergies.  Run the test and dont push the hocus pocus on people who dont want it.  

Second, for someone who is in the medical field, this kind of treatment is definitely messed up, unless your doctor is a therapist or psychiatrist too (highly unlikely) then this is probably malpractice to offer those services.  

third outside of the big religions, theres PLENTY of non-binary presentations. sounds like this person has taken a spiritual approach, mixed it with limited available science, mashed in some evangelical type christianity, and packaged it up and put a bow on it and it smashing it over patients heads.  totally messed up.

I hope you find better care OP.  report that doc to your local medical/licensing board. this is hugely concerning.
What an utter quack, find another doctor immediately. Sorry you had to go through that
What the actual fuck??? ""You either identify with someone in your familys past or with an unborn twin.""   FUCKING WHAT?

Why is a therapist doing allergy tests?  Bet she's not a licensed psychiatrist OR psychologist.
Ok, i’m not an expert. But, even if we discount the transphobia, this doctor sounds like an absolute quack. Allergies are an “internalized wish to die”?? What??
Report that doctor so no one else has to go through this
That doctors comments sounded like some  conversion therapy Bullshit. If you can., try not to go to them again.
Report that doctor
wtf is she a real doctor or someone who was there and decided to make it everyone else's problem?? apart from the hate crime that was just unprofessional as hell.
This feels like something a real doctor wouldn’t say. Who goes for ALLERGY TESTS and is diagnosed as having TRAUMA? This feels like she is desperately clinging onto her other failing therapy practice or something. Or just outright crazy by upfront telling someone “you are identifying with someone from your past life and you just don’t know it”. None of it is scientifically accurate or morally right.
Fucking hell, report that doctor to their manager
You are valid.

This pseudoscience bullshit that she's spouting: absolutely not valid. She is a danger to other people and should be reported.

And all her enby hate isn't valid either.
Paid by check? Stop payment. Deny HER identity of being a  doctor. I half wish you’d tell us where this happened. Unacceptable. Pls consider writing the medical board about this, too. Doctors hate getting notices from The Board abt complaints. Keep us posted, rockstar.
This doesn’t sound like a real doctor. Either you have been bamboozled by a ‘homeopathic practitioner’ or you need to report this person
What the hell? “We live in a binary world…”? Transgenerational trauma? What even is that? So unprofessional. There’s a reason why on lots of legal forms now, non-binary is an option for gender. I would report this doctor. Biological sex is limited, but gender is up to you.
Does this doctor have feathers and a bill? Cause they sound like a goddamn quack. I hope you can find a better one
Only a transphobe would be so densely ignorant by choice that they choose to believe it’s more likely to have allergies directly from “transgenerational trauma” or an unborn twin, than it is for non-binary to be a valid gender identity.

And they say we’re insane for our non-binary identities. Yet we’ve existed for longer than the history books tell us. And we will continue to exist no matter what.
Report this ""doctor"", she deserves to be fired. Not only has she refused to give you any real help for the issue which you came in for but she's pulling up some seriously concerning pseudoscientific bullshit that she thought up or read on some dodgy article which makes me doubt that she has any place in her role.
Report the shit out of this doctor, they are extremely unprofessional and have bogus ideas about how allergies work.
 I would have just walked out and informed her that if I ever had an appointment with her again I would walk out immediately upon seeing her.
This is so not okay and I’m sorry you experienced this. This doctor sounds like they’re trying to do their own form of conversion therapy in trying to invalidate you and use their made up logic to gaslight you into believing you don’t know your own mind. Science isn’t even behind them considering intersex people exist, so no, it’s not binary. Not to mention loads of other evidence.

Please report this doctor to health authorities in your area. This is not okay what so ever and puts a lot of people’s lives in danger.

I hope you can find a doctor who respects your gender and is safe for both your physical and mental health.
Mrs nurse, this is a Wendy's
This doctor sounds like a quack, even in general. Add on the denial of your identity... You totally need to find a better doctor.
100% she uses crystals and essential oils in her ""systemic therapy"" sessions. This person is a out and out quack. Leave a review and find a new doc.
Holy fuck this is just straight up conversion therapy. You absolutely need to report her enbyphobia this is fucking sickening and unprofessional.
um, putting down your allergies as a physical manifestation of suicidal thoughts is not ok. without even getting into the ignorant nonsense transphobia, you need to look into switching doctors.
To hell with her! You are valid. WE AS A COMMUNITY ARE VALID! don't let people tear ya down. Sending love to ya my enby sibling
Lol it isn't a binary world even in the most basic physical sense. Any doctor with even a semester of medical education should know about intersex people. Sex is fluid, gender is fluid, orientation is fluid. It's all a spectrum, and if your doctor was actually paying attention in class he'd know this. 

Go find someone that actually knows what they're doing, this one's broken, throw the whole doctor out.
Ewwwww. Fire her as a health care provider and leave a review wherever you can with her name and your experience.
Solidarity with you on shitty experiences with queerphobic doctors. Last time I went to the doctor not only was I misgendered left and right, I was denied a necessary ultrasound based on my sexuality. Even had the humiliation of the technician loudly shouting to a nurse my sexuality and sexual history in the hall where other patients could hear. I ended up leaving and relied on pain killers until I could see another doctor
Sue for medical malpractice
I want to take a copy of ""Anti-Oedipus"" by Deleuze and Guattari and slap this doctors face with it as hard as I can (in Minecraft) because what in the motherfucking Freud is that bullshit...
I feel like this doctor needs their license revoked and to become a were/was.
Yeah that doctor is bullshit. I have allergies and as a kid before anything wacky trauma wise happened to me (or transition wise if the doctor is implying that, which is immediately fucked), I just thought carrots were spicy. Carrots are not spicy fun fact. That doctor sounds actually fucking insane, like Freudian everyone wanna fuck their mom type crazy. There is literally medically and genetically intersex traits which affect ~1.7% of Americans. Regardless it's not your doctor's job or place to debate your identity when you are going in for allergy testing. Doctors are professionals however the education system is still biased against marginalized identities. Many medical schools still teach that black people feel less pain than white people, which is just fucking insane and entirely inaccurate. This sounds like a fever dream of a doctor.
I'm so sorry you had to deal with this. That doctor is not only transphobic but clearly misinformed about gender identity, and it seems reality. You should report her if you can, this is NOT how patients should be treated, and clearly ignores the research backed by science that validates Non-Binary identities.

You are valid.
Sounds like a great opportunity to post negative reviews about them everywhere, make a formal complaint about them, and never, ever go back! Ever again. This is unacceptable in 2023.
You’d figure a doctor of all people would be intellect, but I guess not
I'm reasonably sure she just walked in one day and claimed she was a doctor. Absolutely no way someone that uninformed has a medical license
Please report this allergist! That was so rude and unnecessary of her to say. And your gender identity has nothing to do with your allergies, idk how she got her license to practice considering that she clearly doesn’t know how allergies work lmao. I’m so sorry this happened to you!
Yeah that’s total bullshit where the heck does she pull the dead twin twist from ? Nothint between he or she ? What about intersex wtf
I hope one day we get -medical-  -professionals- in reality
Ugh. I remember a time something similar happened to me, I was at a walk-in clinic trying to get my prescription for my meds refilled, and upon seeing that my pronouns are they/them, proceeded to ask my mom if I had dissociative identity disorder, and it felt horrible. As other comments are saying, please get a new doctor and report this one. She needs to not be in the medical field.
Omg I hate people who try to make stupid arguments like that. My personal least favourite is when people argue that its so new. Like, what? Nonbinary people and other ""less heard of"" identities - even neopronouns - have existed for ages. IIRC this kind of stuff existed when the Romans were around. THE ROMANS! And even if it was new, that wouldn't mean it's not real. You dont see people saying how the Nintendo switch isn't a real thing because its a newer console.
'binary world'

The a new version of 'life is a simulation' 💀
Email the doctor and ask them to confirm what they want you to do, that way you have it in writing and can report them with physically evidence of their prejudice and unprofessionalism. I’m sorry this happened I can’t believe they think that’s okay to think let alone say to anyone
I'm shocked to hear this person is really a doctor.  What's her letters?  Definitely a spiritualist one with no qualms about evangelizing to patients.   No judgement if you're seeking out someone like that, but don't let them promote fake medicine with a side of transphobia.  

Does she just happen to be private pay only by chance??
A lot of allergy specialists are ignorant snake-oil sales people. Sounds like this toxic practitioner is trying to prey on your vulnerability. Run, and write public reviews so others know.
Holy shit! Sounds like someone is inserting their own beliefs where they shouldn't be! Make sure you keep detailed records. Time, date, doctor's name, nurses names. 

Just for the sake of paperwork, ask for that doctor's recommendation, so you can file a report to the hospital and the state and the national level if you have to. 

This is complete crap and shouldn't be happening to anyone ever in any state. 

I get misgendered at the dentist I go to every single time and it puts me in a daze and a horrible mood the rest of the day. I can only imagine how you must have felt. I hope you're taking care of yourself and getting better help. 

All the best ✌️
Be sure to write all of this on their Yelp!
...that does not sound like a doctor at all. ""Prebirth"" or ""transgenerational"" trauma? ""Psychological"" allergies?! Nonsense.
What kind of puritan psychotic brainwashed bullshit is this.

I am so sorry you had to go through this. 

This doctor should lose her license.
Go after this doctor if you have the ability. The amount of bullshit and discrimination she put you through is... the gall of this woman. I am so sorry you went through this.
Like no need to ask anyone this doctor is legitimately WRONG, and is 100% projecting some strange internalized ideologies..........
Report her to her board, this is unacceptable
I don't think your doctor is a real doctor
PLEASE REPORT HER. someone like this should NOT have their license!!!
Run from that doctor as fast as possible. I'm so sorry that happened to you 😔
I have life threatening allergies and that’s not how they work you should get a new doctor for that reason alone but add on the transphobia drop them as soon as possible because that’s just wrong
wtf lmao I’m so sorry you had to deal with that. what unscientific bullshit
Sounds like your doc is seriously into some esotheric bullshit (aka not a real medicine). Run away until she harms you more than she already did.
jezuzfuckingchrist how absolutely horrific 🤦🏼‍😤😡 she is SO OUT OF LINE, this makes me SICK🤢 doctors should NEVERRR push their ideals onto their patients.
You should report this doctor and leave them a scathing review.
ew how could someone believe in this how as a person in the medical field do they have such disrespect for humans that are a tiny different and how does transgenerational trauma have to do with being trans i can't think of one way how they correlate
what an uneducated person! imagine when she finds out about intersex people
Have her listen to binary by The Spook School
Ew wtf?!?  I’m so sorry you went through this - I’m not sure where you’re located but I’ve been seeing an allergist/immunologist for years due to lots of autoimmune and allergy issues and have never been treated like that.  I only say that to say - there is hope!  There are good ones out there.  I think depending on your country there are lists of LGBTQ affirming providers - I know it’s always so much harder to find specialists on those lists.  Does anyone know a good list for specialists for this lovely person to help find the care they need??  

Also I am just…outraged by this dr’s GROSS unprofessionalism at acting like they have any right to your trauma history?!  What?  And also trying to sell their own shady and questionable services when you are clearly there for professional medical help.  It’s not that dr’s job to try to sell herself, it’s her job to be a damn Dr, or find a new job.  I hate people like that - I’m so sorry OP😤😣😢

Edit: also, I know LGBTQ affirming sadly doesn’t always include us Non-Binary folks.  I hope that changes more in the future😔
You just wanted an allergy test not a social and gender structure ""lesson"". 
Get a new doc that actually cares about the patient.

Non-binary human that asks for/requires allergy test. That's pretty simple in my mind (the mind of a non-binary EMT...LOL).
1. Switch doctors
2. Report this doctor. Immediately. That is in some states, an automatic termination without a warning if talking to a patient this way. Wow. I’m so sorry this happened to you.
I smell a malpractice lawsuit waiting to happen. What a quack. Sorry you had to go through that bull.
For a doctor, there should be no right or wrong, nor any good or evil, and that bleeds into political beliefs as well. A medic of any kind should not discriminate. They should help.
I am so mad on your behalf, and I'm so sorry you had to sit through being dismissed like that by someone so idiotic and hateful. I guess I'm not too surprised but I still can't believe some of these people are allowed to treat humans without better gender sensitivity training. Btw I'm cis but have a young nonbinary child and I would lose it if any medical practitioner spoke to or about him (yes this is his chosen pronoun) this way.
Your doctor was a titanic wanker, and I hope you can find one that isn't making up nonsense and passing it off as any sort of competent medical theory.  You might, if you live in a sane(-ish...) place consider reporting him for misconduct and/or malpractice.
Oh god, you need to find out who you can formally complain to about this. See, even if this doctor was speaking within the realm of fact, their entire brain seems geared to act as an authority who knows best for their patients, instead of someone who listens to their patients and tries to help. I can very easily see this same doctor receiving a patient who lays out their issues, and says what they think the cause is - with reasonable evidence - and this doctor going ""No it's 'x'. It's definitely 'x'. Stop thinking it's 'y'.  


Might be projecting a bit but I recently had a similar experience with a doctor and I just think having these kinds of people getting paid to basically impose their will on others is so fucking dangerous.
May I ask in which country did this happen? This is awful I want to cry
I wonder if that's true, all my life I felt a certain way and even before knowing I had a choice.
And physical health! This doctor will absolutely not take actual issues seriously
Thank you all, i am seeing my therapist on friday but i feel like all these comments and ranting together helped me a lot allready to wrap these things up in a package and put it in the trash. 

Also my flatmate send me reviews of this doc on google that sound the same, also with queer people being told stuff etc. I felt guilty about putting myself in that situation, because i didn't research enough.

Then i remembered, when i went to that allergology the first time, i had just had a gastroskopy and was very desperate to find an allergy test so i finally know whats happening inside of my body. Thus i looked at the first (always postitive) reviews on google and chose the doc on my way home. Next time i will do better research, but it is shitty in the first place that people who need medical support need to do a lot of research to find someone who is competent. This doc should be reported and i will do that when i have energy again, but i guess she was reported some times allready and nothing happened? 🤦

Thank you for your support. Next time stuff like this happens to me i might have the power to just leave. I tend to always listen people out and not put myself in first. So i need someone crossing my boundary before i notice it was too much. Will do my best ♡

Just happy, that i wrote this post during my stay at the doc, questioning her professionality. Otherwise her words could have harmed me more. Now i can laugh at it a little and shake it off.
♡
I second this as someone with allergies.

This so called doctor is going to get someone killed because she has no understanding of how allergies actually work.

She needs her license/certificate revoked so she can't practice medicine and kill someone.

Definitely report her for how she treated you on both accounts, the transphobia and the total lack of understanding how allergies work.
Second this. Allergies are basically immune system hypersensitivity to things that are generally harmless. Putting it down to trauma has quite literally led people to try to ""mind over matter"" an allergy and come out losing.

Allergies are annoying at best and possibly deadly at worst. They should not be treated with woo therapy.
Exactly.
Yeah, this just sounds so wild to me how they can even practice??? Sounds super weird, would definitely find a new doctor and report her for that whole mess. Sorry you had to go through such a terrible time. 😖
seriously! as a biology major, one of the first things you learn is that it’s very difficult to categorize organisms and create rules because there’s almost always exceptions
This is the funniest thing to me. It’s bad enough that non-medical assholes deny scientific and psychological consensus, but when actual medical professionals do it? Bonkers. Embarrassing.
Yes! Especially about that part, I can't imagine the harm such words could have caused a person hearing it who is or has been suicidal. So wrong!
Legit. I felt like I had a stroke trying to understand this pseudoscience bullshit.
How do i report a doctor and to whom? In general or in germany

Yes thanks i talked to my roomies and we ranted together about how shit she is.

Took a photo of her certificate for systemic coachings and appearantly the ""institute"" has the same last name. Might be her fathers/uncles/mothers or what ever relative institute and they spread bullshit or she just got it all wrong.
I agree!  This “doctor” sounds fraudulent and that they are pushing their own political agenda and weird beliefs over medicine and the well being of their patients. Very unethical and harmful!  And most likely this allergist is practicing “medicine” outside of what they are legally qualified to practice.  They need to be reported.  I’ve read about doctors like this that have just gone completely off the deep end especially over the last 4-5 years.
Biological sex isn't limited either, sex is also as complex, expansive and nuanced just like gender is. If she really got a degree, she would have learned that at some point.
Also that whole ""this is coming from trauma with you having an unborn twin"" thing sounds like bullshit pseudoscience. She should fucking lose her job and license, all you wanted was to be treated for your allergies not fucking outright deny you of your identity.
Seriously though, I think you need a new doctor, it isn't healthy to be around people who will invalidate you like this.
Germany, Leipzig.. you wouldn't think that it happens here but it's happening everywhere probably
Lol hey binary doctor person, tell me if a virus is an organism or not
Reading it I was like:Ayo, you yohoho no. That is not how it works, wtf
You can report her to the Ärztekammer for your Bundesland/Region. E.g. the Ärztekammer Nordrhein has a form that you can print and send to them.
u/KatWine is correct, I've just recently reported a doctor to the Ärtzekammer in my Bundesland myself. I was able to fill in the complaint form online and send it to them that way, and got a confirmation that it's been received and will be investigated accordingly.

You could also leave a review online (Google reviews and other services where this doctor may show up) if you feel comfortable doing so.
As I am an enby with allergies in Germany as well, would you mind telling me the general area? I want to avoid that kind of „professional“ as much as possible
Working as a speech (and therefore also trans voice) therapist in Germany, I lost count on how many Ärztekammer complaints I have written because people didn't get their Verordnung.
Btw, you can also reach out to your Krankenkasse.
seriously.  Im a pharmacist, ive also studied Peruvian Shamanism.  but I would NEVER push any of my spirituality onto a patient.  If im at work, its science based only.  If im practicing as a coach/shaman, thats the lens I work with at that time, occasionally if people want to talk theres crossover with good explanation/discussion.  but this whole situation is SO unethical and harmful on a bunch of levels.
I feel like this harkens back more like 40 years because it sounds like something right out of the Satanic Panic playbook. A lot of doctors who preached this kind of nonsense lost their licences to practice psychology for inventing false memories that tore families apart and literally sent people to prison.
Limited probably wasn’t the right choice of words. I meant to say that it’s more restrictive in terms of what you’re assigned at birth. But yes, this doctor OP interacted with sounds like they need therapy themselves.
IS FIRE ALIVE
Yes and no
Or mushrooms. What are mushrooms pray tell? Wanna put them all into neat “this or that” doc?
I love how the sentences sound with Ärztekammer and Bundesland in it ♡

Thank you, I will give it a try :)
Leipzig, Frau ""Dr."" Haferkorn
As an American jaded by our health system, I can confirm that Krankenkasse, transliterated into English as crank case, is definitely accurate for my health insurance.

[For non-native speakers, definition 2D](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/crank)
Good point!  Everyone is entitled to different beliefs.  And they can be practiced in a way that is respectful and helpful to everyone. 

The doctor the OP is describing is forcing their beliefs onto others. It sounds like their are prioritizing their own beliefs over patient care or actually in spite of patient harm.  

I didn’t mean to say other beliefs in general are invalid. But the way the OP’s care was unhelpful and hurtful for them just made me livid!

Daethefancy you sound like a good pharmacist! ❤️🌈❤️🌈
So you're saying you can't fill my ayahuasca prescription?
Probably, but also, more likely, not.
Meaty plant go brrt
""mushrooms are obviously a plant! wait, no, they do eat other organisms kinda like an animal... my theory is that it's a plant with mental health issues and can't actually eat other living things it just thinks it can""
Alright, thanks. Probably won’t run into her than
Thx hun, this absolutely made my evening!! 😅😂😅 Tho I would actually be interested in how American health care works. So far I only know German and Swiss insurance policies..
Oh i didnt get that you were invalidating beliefs at all.  I agreed with what you were saying 100%.

And thanks! i got out of the retail world and am in insurance now, which is a whole other beast.  But, trying to fight the good fight for everyone. especially my enby family.  It stinks the medical community is literally at a minimium a decade behind in everything they do.
Haha, sorry. We don’t compound where I work.
hint: the question is more about the definition of life than the nature of fire.
Step 1. Sell soul


Ste...


Wait let me start over

Step 1. Insurance company sets price they believe something to be worth. Often influenced by frequency of billing for the procedure as well as by the rate our elderly and disabled federal policy pays (Medicare). This amount is typically insanely high 

Step 2. Hospital/Doctor sets pricing based on making a profit.

Step 3a. Patient buys policy or has workplace policy. I am fortunate to have relatively good coverage for a reasonable cost. I pay about $300 a month to cover me, my wife, and my son. My job pays another ~16,000 per year for my plan. This is NOT common. I am very fortunate.

3b. Patient needs care. Must select doctor who accepts their insurance.

3c. Patient receives subpar care and pays a flat rate co-pay upfront

Step 4. Hospital submits claim

Step 5. Claim goes to insurance employee whose job it is to make sure that every i is dotted and every t is crossed. Coding, pre-authorization, could cheaper tests have been done, etc. Each item on Claim is negotiated down to the ""allowable billing amount"" which is fancy talk for ""we rigged this so that cash patients are screwed but we made agreements with the providers about actually paying less"". Then a portion of the remainder is paid or denied based on insurance company profits and arbitrary rules. E.g. I had a knee injury to a tendon and needed to get a MRI. Insurance required that I have an x-ray first because it's cheaper and could show what the problem was. Not really, because it wasn't a bone problem. Then I was allowed the MRI. If my doctor hadn't known this, I would have had to pay out of pocket due to denial of claim. 

Step 6. Patient gets a bill for the remainder. Now, I had to pay $45 for the x-ray, which was billed north of $200. I then had to pay $1100 for the MRI, which was billed at around $8,000.

Step 7. Patient wonders why they pay for insurance.
Good points!  And anyone in any profession can be a flawed in some way.  Best we can all do is be open minded and respectful of others.

I know a lot of people treat doctors like they are all knowing and sometimes they act like it!  The longer I live the more I realize everyone barely knows what they are doing 😂"	10e80ri	NonBinary	718	1.0	2023-01-17 09:26:50
Sometimes I wish I still looked like the left one but most of the times I'm very happy with my current more masculine but still feminine /or androgynous appearance. I'm not sure if that's considered non binary ? (sorry if it's an annoying question, I'm still exploring my identity)		"Damn. Both of those presentations are hot. 💖

Presentation, while a factor, is only one part of gender. 

Depends on what you prefer, maybe you're just the hottest androgynous presenting woman ever? You tell me, OP.
Non-binary is a huge spectrum !! There’s no need to feel pressured into looking a certain way, if you feel that this word describes you well then you fit being non-binary !
I mean if you feel feminine terms are wrong, and like gender neutral terms then that should count as non binary
The fun part about this is you get to decide what you are - whether you’re a woman, a man, non-binary, genderfluid, or something else. It doesn’t matter how you express yourself or how other people perceive you (or how you “present” as some people put it) those are all things you can be. A man with long hair one day and short the next, a woman with a cool shirt, a non-binary person with nice cheekbones. Nobody has the authority to tell you who and what you are except you :)
there's not a certain way to look non binary, u can look and present feminine and masculine and still identify as non binary. remember, non binary is a gender identity not a look. being non binary doesn't mean u have to look androgynous!! 

but beside that, u look amazing in both pictures wow u can really rock any length!
It kind of depends on you if feel comfortable identifying like that or not. If you’d still rather be considered a woman, there’s nothing wrong with that either
Anything can be non binary! It’s really up to the person, if you feel non binary then you are! And may I just say you look absolutely gorgeous as either! You can always save up and buy a nice lace front wig for the days you feel/wanna look more feminine! Get the best of both worlds!! Not questions related to figuring yourself out will ever be annoying, I wish you well in your gender journey!
This looks awesome
You’re a fabulous looking human in both pictures!
It's totally  valid to present differently than is typical of your gender even if cis. It's also totally valid to feel more like one than the other, but not entirely like that one. It's also totally valid to flux between what you feel like. I hope you resolve your journey of identity nicely, and you look great while you're doing it.
Stunning picture
Ahh thanks! I didnt deserve these sweet comments!
But yeah, my confusion is with the terms genderfluid/androgynous/nonbinary, can you be all of them at once?
You're very welcome.

To answer your question: Absolutely. 

Anything outside of strictly male or female can be considered nonbinary. (All labels are optional btw.) 

Genderfluid can be considered to be a subtype of nonbinary or simply an identity in its own right. 

Androgynous generally serves as an adjective but androgyne is a closely related gender identity. Androgyne could definitely be considered nonbinary as well. 

Its all pretty complicated and a lot of it is optional. 

Nonbinary and genderfluid both can be a stand-alone identity and an umbrella-term.  

So it really depends on how the person in question views themselves and the way they relate to other people and their gender."	peuzsc	NonBinary	717	1.0	2021-08-31 00:34:59
Came out to my therapist, I don't know if I wanna see her again	"TW: Transphobia, dysphoria

(TL;DR at end)

I recently started accepting myself as non-binary, Agender specifically, after working through internalised transphobia and enby-phobia (I guess?). And about a week ago my mum asked me if I was trans because she had been suspecting that something was up. I would've come out to her sooner, but she had previously shown openly transphobic behaviour, but it turns out she's changed and is very accepting and supportive (although she doesn't really understand what non-binary is). 

Now, I've been struggling with bad social dysphoria which (among other things) has been getting in the way of confidently going out in public and finding a job, so I thought it would help to speak to my therapist about it so we could work through it. So in my most recent session, I told her that I hated that people perceived me as a woman and how uncomfortable it makes me. So she asked,

""Why don't you want to be a girl?""

I said ""I don't like it, it feels wrong""

then she asked ""do you want to be a boy?""

I answered ""no""

She asked, ""why do you want to cancel yourself?""

I just sat there, confused. So I asked what she meant.

And she said, ""Why do you want to take away a part of yourself?""

And I was like 'what the hell is she talking about? I just told her I'm not a girl or boy, there's nothing *to* take away.'

She just did not understand at all. At first I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought, 'oh, she just doesn't understand what non-binary means, but I suppose she could learn,' 

But she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing. 

I tried to explain that being feminine and being perceived as a woman is very uncomfortable and just feels wrong, and I essentially told her that I wanted top surgery (which she referred to as a double mastectomy) and to appear gender neutral. 

And so you know what she asked in response? She asked if I had any s3xual trauma. I don't, but like, how is that even relevant? 

She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

To which she would respond, ""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living."" and ""I know what it's like to think like a boy, I grew up surrounded by them. I don't even own a dress. My b00bs are uncomfortable too, the first thing I do when I get home is take off my bra. I don't like hanging out with other women, all they do is gossip and \[other stereotypes\]."" And then she did the ""when they dig up your skeleton they'll see a woman's skeleton"" thing and other ridiculous arguments.

But she understands that you can't change your thoughts/mind, y'know? She kept saying that ""you can change how you look as much as you want, but that won't change your thoughts."" 

And I thought 'EXACTLY ?? I want to change my body to fit my thoughts/mind'. 

She continued, ""you'll only ever have feminine thoughts""

To which I said, ""I've never had feminine thoughts.""

Her response: ""No, you've always had feminine thoughts. Let's simplify it all the way down. Do you sit down to pee?""

I was like, ""?? Of course I do?? It's easier than standing up, why would I do it any other way? That's not even a 'feminine thought', it's a practicality thing.""

And she started questioning how I would transition to be gender neutral by pointing out all the things I'm dysphoric about, and saying ""double mastectomy is very hard to get and its very expensive. How are you planning to pay for it? I know your family can't afford it. How are you going to change your voice? Or your bone structure?"" She was acting like I had brought this all up on a whim and not like I hadn't been thinking thoroughly about it for at least the past 2 years. 

I stopped listening to half the things she was saying coz I was so mad/frustrated at her ignorance. And after a while I just stopped saying anything because I was not in the mood to argue about it, especially because I'm terrible at arguing. It probably made her think she was 'winning' the argument.

Then, and I don't know why she felt the need to do this, she told me about her friend's son, who is a trans man. She showed me a picture of him and was saying how he got top surgery, bottom surgery, and probably also hrt (I can't remember), all the while misgendering and dead-naming him. She was like, 'this is my friend's *daughter*, \[dead name\], *she* goes by \[chosen name\]. *She* had this surgery, and that surgery. *She's* not really a woman, but *she's* not a man, and this is a picture of *her* when *she* was a little *girl*."" \*shows picture that is literally a young boy\*

She says that no matter what I say, her opinion of me won't change, and that I'm free to identify how I want to. But from what I experienced, she won't fully respect my identity and will always see me as a girl, which is exactly what I was afraid of. She managed to trigger my dysphoria, anxiety, and depression all in one go. She just wants the best for me, she's nice, but I don't know if I'll be comfortable going to her again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I came out to my therapist about being Agender, and she didn't understand at all and was very transphobic about it in the typical transphobe way, and I left feeling worse than when I went in."	"Yeah hell no. I'm nonbinary, and a mental health therapist. Too many points to note which were inappropriate, so to summarize: all of what they said was shit. That's not therapy. It may take some searching but competent therapists are out there. Hang in there pal.
I’d send her a message telling her she needs to do research if she is going to be working with trans clients. Let her know why you left before you leave. But definitely leave. Therapists are supposed to be your support not your bully
Trust your gut, OP. ABSOLUTELY find a new therapist, and I’d even report her to her college because it’s pretty unethical what she did. Not just gross, but she straight up put you in danger by doing what she did. 

You know yourself, be true to you ❤️
Yeah, report them and never go back. That's just a basic lack of professionalism.
Good god that sounds horrible. I hated reading that, really sorry. This person should definitely not be practicing for trans or probably any queer people. Or maybe just any people.
Is there any way you can report this woman? What she said to you is absolutely disgusting and could have had disastrous consequences for someone who was in the wrong headspace. I’m so sorry you went through that, she is wrong (as I’m sure you know from having more than one functional brain cell).
Oh my god, i got frustrated just READING that. Jesus fucking Christ. Ignorance is not an excuse to talk to someone that way! As someone who is going into this field, this was handled so poorly by her. It's one thing to simply be uneducated about trans identities, but she doesn't even care to learn. 

Im so sorry you had this experience with someone who is supposed to be an educated professional. I encourage you to seek a new therapist <333
>""That's not going to get food on the table/pay the bills etc., you can identify however you like, but it's not going to help you to get a job or earn a living.""

What even is that? 

That sounds like a lecture from your parents about job prospects, not the kind of thing a therapist should ever be saying about any form of self care! ""How is making yourself happy and taking care of your mental health going to put food on the table?""  What the fuck.  You can't put food on the table if you're too depressed and dysphoric to work.

She sounds like you just said your dream is to be a dog psychic, not that you're talking about your mental and physical wellbeing. 

If you can OP, I would see if you can find a queer or at least queer and trans friendly therapist. My therapist is genderqueer and it's revolutionary never to have to explain my identity to them.
Holy shit, I would've walked out as soon as she did this

>she just looked confused and then did the whole ""you have to be one or the other"" ""there's no in between"" ""p3n1s or v4g1na"" ""only 2 sexes"" thing.

This therapist should not be seeing people. She is extremely ignorant and transphobic as hell. I'm so sorry you went through this
people who say and believe shit like this shouldn't be allowed to therapists, there literal job is to talk you through your problems and help you achieve mental stability, not to trigger every fucking alarm in you, constantly mistreat you and be extremely offensive to patients

you are agender and valid, and no one but you can take that away from you. Your therapist doesn't want the best for you, if she did, she wouldn't deny your thoughts and call you crazy for not conforming the society's extremely bullshit gender norms/ideas
So thay sounds like she was mega projecting onto you (she clearly has *issues* around her own gender, at least others of her gender) and yes absolutely do not go back to her.
Fuck that therapist I’m so sorry your are going through this. I would definitely never see her again.
Even without the awful transphobia it sounds like your therapist is very unprofessional, they shouldn’t have shown photos of someone else. I hope you can find the therapist you need. :)
This is the worst of these experiences I have ever heard. Holy fuck. Yeet this therapist into orbit and report the shit out of her!
That's not even on the same post code of what a therapist should say.

Ithat's what my idiot mom said when I came out.

Run!

(And leave without paying if you can, they don't deserve a cent.)
okay that last part about the friend's son is def some sort of violation of confidentiality. get out now.
What a disgusting person. Bigots like that shouldn't even have a license to practise.
You need to find a new therapist. 
Your therapist works for you. 
You deserve one who will support you.
I specifically sought out a LGBTQ+ therapist (and that was before I was questioning, I just was seeking safety and ENBY is now a topic I explore with her). If you can, I recommend doing the same if you can. Therapy is such a vulnerable activity and what you shared here is worth reevaluating that relationship imho.
So she's openly phobic towards you, projects her own experiences/feelings onto you, tries to guilt trip you into not seeking treatment...she should not be allowed to practice therapy.
Haha report that therapist
“If they dig up your skeleton they’ll see a woman’s skeleton” bitch if they dig up your skeleton you could be misidentified as a man, skeletons are not that fucking easy to sex.
What a nightmare!! Everything she said is wrong, cruel, biased, and foolish. This woman is deranged and uneducated, do not go back
I only read most of that but the part where the therapist said the thing about there are 2 sexes you have to pick pick one and....omfg..when they dig up your skeleton!??!?!

This woman is not your therapist. She has big terf energy.

This brings me back to coming out as NB to a cis female close friend and her laughing it off like bro you are huge just be a bro, bro.

 Finding a good therapist even when you are cis is a process it's like going on a bunch of dates until you find the person you have compatibility with.

 Sending you NB love and pride.
It's frustrating to hear how much a fellow therapist failed you and failed to uphold the professional ethical standards we are supposed to follow. Clearly this therapist is not competent in managing trans and gender diverse concerns. This therapist should probably get some training. It can be daunting to either bring up this conflict directly with your therapist or go through the process of finding a different one. Either way, you deserve a better counseling experience and I wish you luck however you decide to move forward.
Wow, I am so sorry that happened to you. Please take care of yourself! Even if she believed all of those horrible things, or didn’t know what you were talking about, as a therapist, her responsibility is to non judgmentally help you with what you are experiencing. And boy, did she fail at that. Ugh. So sorry. 😢
I’m so angry on your behalf!! Cancel yourself?? Seriously??? Sounds like she watches Fox News. 

If anyone ever starts talking to you like that again, you are allowed to stand up and say, “This session is over,” and walk the fuck out. Slam the door on the way out if you like.
Report that shit. Whatever their professional organization is send a passed off letter.
Fuck this. As far as the sexual trauma thing goes, it is relevant. Some detrans people- women specifically- transition to become male or transmasc as a response to sexual trauma. They see their gender (woman, usually) as being why they were targeted (and that’s often at least partially true) so they begin to hate their woman-ness for getting them hurt, even though, you know, the only person responsible is their attacker/rapist. Other times, it’s a cognitive thing; they were attacked as a woman in a woman’s body, so they mentally dissociate from their body as a way of separating themselves from the trauma. Sort of like someone changing their name to escape bad things they did/had done to them in the past. It’s complex, but her comments beyond asking if you had sexual trauma were entirely irrelevant and she is not paid to tell you that what you feel is or isn’t real- it is, purely because you feel it.
Your therapist sucks. She sounds like a fundamentalist religious counselor type. Don’t listen to any of what she spouts. She’s not nice and she doesn’t have a clue what the best for you is. You deserve so much more.
This this is the reason why we need more Queer Affirmative therapist
Get a new therapist.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
yeah fuck that therapist. she is literally doing the opposite of her job
Please leave that practice and fill out every negative review possible/you're comfortable doing.
I'd report her
Dump her. But also, she is being abusive. Not sure if she is private or with your provider's office...either way figure out a way to complain, report, or make your voice heard. And leave a bad review if possible.
That was horrible. Unprofessional. And disgusting behaviour. You should never have to feel that disrespected in a setting that is supposed to be a safe space to talk about anything on your mind. Not okay at all. Report that, exactly what you wrote and how it made you feel, and find someone new. I know how hard it is to get a new therapist and start over. But that would be better than someone who doesn’t respect who you are. That won’t help you at all, it’ll just hurt you. And at that point. Why pay the money to be lectured at about how you don’t know who you are? I’m so sorry you had to go through that OP. No one should be made to feel like they have to shut down and ignore a therapist in your own therapy session.
Not only does she sound like a bad person, she's a terrible therapist! Take it from someone with a whole ass psychology degree, you're never supposed to let your personal beliefs influence how you treat your clients/patients. I'm also Dailey certain she broke several codes of conduct by showing you photos and discussing the personal details of her friends son. 

Absolutely find a new therapist! There are so many good queer friendly ones out there who will understand help you! 

Best of luck ❤️
Unbelievably cringe therapist, fuck that. I’m sorry you had to deal w that
New therapist and COMPLAIN about that one. She shouldn’t be practicing
Holy shit. Excuse my language but that lady is out of her ever lasting mind! Don't go back to see her, you can get a therapist else where who isn't homo/transphobic, respectful and, supportive of you and your goals. I'm so sorry that happened. Hopefully you find a better therapist that is a decent human being. There are apps that offer therapy from therapists so that's an option. Sadly, I have never seen a free therapist but you could see if they have financial aid or if your insurance covers it, that's me assuming you're in the USA or Canada, I admit I know nothing about how other places do it, but I digress.
Naw.

I had a non-binary therapist, and they were absolutely amazing.

I had gone to them for a few different things, but when I mentioned going on HRT hopefully sooner rather than later they were super accepting and after hearing me ramble about how I knew what changes there would be, that I wouldn’t necessarily adore some but also wouldn’t really have a PROBLEM with them, that I knew the risks, blah blah blah, they had nothing much to say other than support.

Wish I coulda kept seein them but insurance changed, and now I ain’t got any at the moment, but I’d like to think they’d be real happy for me with how far I’ve come in only about a year.

Your therapist tho? 

If you’re able to, I’d definitely consider finding a new one.
Holy shit I am SO sorry this happened! That therapist shouldn't even be licensed. I'm a therapist and I'm agender and even if I wasn't and didn't understand, our role is to support the client, seek to support them in gaining insight, and work toward *their* goals, never to be condescending, transphobic, and violent like this. Definitely support you doing what you need and want for YOU and you have every right to file complaints with the practice and licensing board if you want to. Sending you lots of care and encouragement ❤️
You are paying them . You can get up and leave. Fuck this lady and never go back. There ARE gender understanding therapist out there.
Yeah so... You should report her, in my opinion.  I'm nonbinary and also work in mental health and if anyone at my work said this bullshit they would get fired SO fast.  Like, my coworkers don't always get it and sometimes they say ignorant shit because they don't understand, but it is literally company policy that we have to use people's preferred names and pronouns and the agency as a whole is in support of LGBTQ+ rights even though I work in an area of the country that is transphobic AF.  If she's a solo practitioner then idk if anything will be done, but if she works under any kind of agency she would likely get fired, which tbh she deserves.  Even beyond her shitty opinions, if she talked to someone like that even if she was in the right, she would STILL be behaving extremely unprofessionally.  No therapist should ever be that condescending and outright dismissive of a patient, regardless of context.
She doesn’t want the best for you if she intentionally triggered you like that my fellow NB friend. Even if they didn’t understand a good therapist wouldn’t have gone out of their way to do that to you.
I have an amazing she/they therapist, you need to find a new one. You deserve so much better!
Please please please find someone competent. This is absolutely unacceptable. 

I see that you're a bit hesitant to find someone new but please do! This is really, truly not acceptable. This person is harmful. You should not continue seeing them.
Therapist: time to shop for a new one.

Your mom: her attitude was crap but she had questions. It sounds like she might be open to learning. And if she truly does love you no matter what, she will be. Share some resources about gender theory with her so she can begin to understand how gender is fluid and a construct. 

Love and light to you, I'm sorry coming out has started this way for you.
Nope nope nope please never see them again
I hope you report them and are able to find someone new. You deserve better!
My significant other (a man) pees sitting down. Does that make him a woman??

Yay on your mom not being gross!!

Find a new therapist.
I had my 80 year old therapist say that my being nonbinary was a defense mechanism / excuse. The next appointment was our last, and she seemed surprised. But I found an LGBTQ+ friendly therapist that I moved on to. It's much better having a therapist who believes you. Move on from your transphobic therapist. ❤️
I told my psychiatrist and psychologist that I'm genderfluid leaning towards feminine and they immediately asked which pronouns I'd like them to use. You need a new therapist.

I'm sorry you went through that. I've had a few weird comments from my respective therapists but when I've asked them to explain what they meant it was perfectly reasonable. I hope you get it sorted out!
Jesus fucking Christ, never go back there. Consider reporting this (her) to the licensing board as this sounds like conversion therapy and is not how you conduct a therapy session in any way shape or form (I’m a therapist). You deserve better. Please do not go back to this monster.
disgusting, please don't come back
I noped out of the paragrah after the pee note, pease change therapist. She is just transphobic and inappropriate.
“Feminine thoughts”? What is this woman saying at this point ☠️☠️☠️ I’m sorry please get a better therapist if you can and report her for transphobia if the institution has the rights for
This therapist sounds like she's chosen the wrong career. I'd find someone else.
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
There is more than two genders and sexual 😤 transphobes and homophobes need to learn that
This is so gross. You're not crazy OP. Do not trust this person with your well-being
I’ve always been nervous to come out to a therapist or just a doctor in general but I’ve done so reluctantly and every professional has been super accommodating and respectful. I hope you find a therapist who actually does their job and doesn’t let bias and their own ignorance dictate their practice!
I’m so sorry for the horrendous treatment by someone who should know better. I don’t know where you are but I hope you can find someone that can provide the affirming care you need and deserve.
As a non-binary therapist in training and also a client in therapy with a therapist who fully supports my being non-binary, you deserve *so* much better from your therapist. You deserve a safe space to be yourself and to be heard. But what she was saying here was so full of hate and misunderstanding. :(


I hope that she's been good for you in other areas, but this therapist clearly has a *lot* of transphobia that she is completely unashamedly projecting onto you. She needs to take a step back from her work and work out why she has an issue with trans and non-binary people and not see any clients in these groups until she's done some very serious personal work!!!

I hope you're doing okay, you are who you know you are and your identity is real and valid!! <3
Thank you for the trigger warnings♡
Highly unprofessional, please OP don't go back to her. And obviously don't believe one thing she has said, it's 100% bullshit.

She also should be reported for outing her friend's son. WTF is that? Showing his picture, outing him and dead naming him to a patient? She crossed several lines there.
LEAVE!!!
omg this isn't just don't see her again, this is don't see her and file a grievance with her site director or supervisor. the way she's asking about how you use the bathroom screams ""what genitals do you have"" and in a therapeutic relationship that question is incredibly inappropriate and borderline sexual harassment. a therapist has power over their client and they need to recognize that and attempt to level the playing field. deciding how you feel for you? that's disgusting. what's the point of you even going to these sessions if she's just gonna write your story for you? I'm so sorry op, it's so hard to be trans and be respected in healthcare. I wish you the best in finding a new therapist ❤️
I'm stuck with medi-cal and can't get any therapist other than either a) terrible untrained fools or b) mean old boomers
she was really inappropriate to you, i’m sorry to hear it
Holy shit.  I’m so sorry. Please don’t go back to her, she’s not a safe person.
>She kept asking, ""imagine if you got everything you wanted to look neutral, then what?""

>So I was like ""??? Then I would be happier and more confident because I'll look how I feel like I'm supposed to, and I'll be able to not feel dysphoric for once in my life ??? "" 

This!!!!!!!! It feels great!
*n*^(th) comment saying you need to find a different therapist and drop that one double quick.
fire her! that is unacceptable. I've had my therapist question why I refer to myself as she/her occasionally when talking about times when I was identifying as a girl. I was like, well in my mind, during those years I was presenting/identifying as a girl, so that's the frame of reference I have for myself in those years. I feel like I was trapped in that identity for so long because of family and partner expectations, so it feels like my divorce and resulting self-discovery was a whole new chapter in my life and I'm not the same person I was.
Time to find a new therapist. It's okay to fire this one right away because she can and will cause you damage. What she's doing is abusive.
I don’t have anything to add other people didn’t already say. I’m just really sorry this happened to you. Obviously the way you were treated was wrong. You deserve so much better. There are other therapists out there that can support, validate, and help you. 

This one just turned out to be a real stinker.
Report her
Everything she said was pretty much a summed up list of transphobic talking points. Like point for point.
This person does NOT have your best interests at heart. She’s completely nuts. Better no therapist at all then having to deal with that horseshit.
Just wanna say the whole ""when they dig up your skeleton it will still be a woman's skeleton"" argument is bollocks anyway. I don't remember the specific details but I saw a tiktok saying skeletons are actually gender neutral and they can't tell the difference. Despite what people think
What the actual hell?

This person sounds about as unprofessional as you can get. I am appalled that people like this advertise themselves as therapists, should be fucking illegal or something- jesus.
Everyday more genuinely don't understand how people can trust therapists....
Please review this provider and mention that she is blatantly transphobic and pushes traditional gender roles, so other trans people know to keep away.

YIKES
what an awful therapist, fired immediately
She sounds awful
Using a ""Professional"" job to spout utter nonsense like that (Especially in a position where vulnerable people have to open up about their thoughts) should earn nothing more than a brick through a window.
Yikes. You’re going to need a second therapist because of the first one. That’s awful
She should have therapy, not you. Never go see her again, be you🥰 you got this!💪👏😘
That sucks. Therapists are people. People can be transphobes. And transphobes almost never change. You just didn't know, 'cause it hasn't come up until now. At least there is no doubt about it.

File an official complaint to the organisation she works for and any medical association they fall under (don't forget to mention she leaked personal info from another person in your session either, including their picture and misgendering them), give one star ratings on healthcare related websites, burn her on socials and NEVER come back.
I literally can’t believe my eyes. I’ve read a bunch of therapy horror stories but damn, this is on a whole other level. 

I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt and assume she’s just extremely uneducated, which is still unacceptable tho because all therapists should be able to work with trans patients. 

However, I think her approach was also quite rude, aggressive and unprofessional because she was clearly pushing her views onto you, which therapists aren’t supposed to do. When you come out, your therapist shouldn’t question, investigate or challenge your identity if you don’t ask them to; if they do, it literally turns into borderline conversion therapy. 

All of her inappropriate questions and remarks make her sound like a massive terf tbh, she’s clearly not the right person for you imo and even if “she could learn”, it’s not your job to educate her
Make sure you give her a bad review on whatever services she's with and tell people she's extremely transphobic so nobody else needs to deal with that.
She’s toxic as fuck. Extremely narrow minded. It’s dangerous.
You need to find a new therapist, specifically a gender affirming / LGBT sensitive one.
The digging up bones argument is so stupid bc it’s not like I’m gonna be alive to care that an archaeologist misgenders me. Like how could I even care how my bones get gendered when I’ve already been dead for hundreds of years?
I am so sorry! When I came out to my therapist the only thing we talked about was what name/pronouns I wanted to use and if she should note it in my file so the front desk knew too. 

What your therapist did is so horrifically out of line. I would not go back to see her. You don't owe her anything and if you don't feel comfortable telling her you don't want to see her anymore you can just ghost her. Her behavior was the antithesis of nice and it sounds like she's more worried with her comfort than what is best for you. 

Again, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.
Please report them too. They shouldn't be saying shit like that. It's detrimental and in no way in line with any ethical code for therapy standards. She needs more of education and to stfu with her personal opinions.
I'm so sorry this happened to you. Do not go back to this therapist. You deserve to have your identity respected. It's scary how many therapists are openly transphobic. You might want to check out r/therapyabuse
Im sorry this happened, hopefully you’re able to find a better therapist soon
use the website psychology today and you can find queer friendly therapists 💝
1) I’m so sorry. 2) why the fuck aren’t therapists required to understand gender dysphoria??? 3) fuck her. 4) find a new therapist.
so sorry you had to go through that. Your therapist is a transphobe, you deserve better
Yeah that's not right. I would have told her higher ups about how she treated you. It's always a bad sign when therapists invalidate their patients and try to win arguments with them. I hope you told her to stop misgendering you and that it was making you feel uncomfortable so she got the picture. That was really mean and insensitive of her. Oh and don't even get me started on the archologist stumbling across a ""male"" vs ""female"" skeleton cring bullshit. These people are so narrow-minded they can't seem to figure out the difference between the central nervous stem and the skeletal system.
Sounds like you may need a therapist to get over the trauma your therapist caused you. You should send her a bill and report her to the board for causing you trauma. That’s almost, if not actually, malpractice.
That's not a therapist. That's a transphobe
Fckkkkkkk this person. Leave and report them. That's not how a therapist should be AT ALL.
God.  My therapist was like this too.

I didn't fully tell him I was trans but I mentioned my gender feeling wrong often.  And I requested the use of my name ""Sunflower,"" which he seemed to respect at first.

But over time he started writing my dead name on my schedule cards and when I brought it up, he said:
""Are you running away from your past by changing your name?""

I said no, I just didn't like my old name because of the trauma and parents divorce drama surrounding it.  So I picked a new one that made me happy.  (And fit me as an Enby)

I wasn't trying to ""turn into someone else.""

Then he starts trying to convince me that Sunflower is weird and MIGHT work as a middle name.
But I should pick something normal.
Then he said: ""You look like your name is Patty.""
I straight up looked and dressed masc, and he'd made comments about my weight before (no offense to anyone with these names) so I knew him suggesting names like ""Patty, Bessy, Bettsy"" were also a jab at this.

I just grimaced and made up something about that being a character from Doug and tried to get back on track with the session.

So glad I never had another with him after that.

He did zero to make me feel like I could be vulnerable.  Especially about my gender.
I have several friends who have fired their therapists after a bad session. On top of that, most have requested to not pay for their final session, or requested to get their money back if they had already paid. Simply explain that instead of being helpful, your last session was extremely harmful and problematic, and that you either won't be paying for that session, or that you'd like your money back. 

Also, please report her to her governing body immediately. She requires a license to practice, which means she needs to uphold a certain code of ethics. Your provincial/state governing body should be aware of your session and they should investigate her. They can revoke her license if it's serious enough. Please report her so the next NB doesn't have to suffer through the same experience.

I'm so sorry you had to experience this.
If you can, definitely find a new therapist. If you feel comfy and want to, you can report her. If you want, you can also leave a review on Google/ZocDoc/whatever medical site she’s on—that way future potential nonbinary and trans clients will know to avoid her
I'm so sorry that this happened to you. I'm shocked, she really neess to get with the times otherwise she should get her license revoked. The last thing a therapist should do is make you feel triggered, absolutley find a new one.
Holy shit, I am so sorry that happened to you. Never speak to this awful woman again. She is straight up full of shit.
I probably wouldve told her to go fuck herself
Gosh, your uncertainty about the situation made me think the transphobia was going to be SUBTLE or something. Fuck going back, I don't think she even deserves to get paid for that session
what kind of an excuse for a therapist is that
I'm really sorry that this had to happen to you, i hope you are getting better
Non-binary therapist and supervisor here. You can report her to her licensing board for ethical violation and discrimination. Someone like that has no place in the mental health field. The American Counseling Association (leading association for therapists and counselors) and the American Psychiatric Association (leading association for psychologists) both recognize nonbinary identities as valid, and clearly state that failing to respect an individual's identity is discrimination and therefore in violation of the code of ethics. Link to the APA guidelines [https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf](https://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf) 

You are amazing courageous to come out and it is infuriating that she did not treat the gift of knowledge that you gave her with the respect you deserve.
That therapist needs to stop practising.
That’s so so so inappropriate let alone discriminatory. I’d call it bullying.
It is not her place to “inform” you on you (especially when she is just trying to protect her narrow world view, not actually provide you with any accurate or helpful insight)- it is her job to work with you to understand yourself better (which means listening to YOUR input and respecting that) so that you can build a happier, healthier life. 
Yikes on a skateboard.
I am so sorry you have been so badly let down by a so called professional who should be there to help you.
Hi, I’m genderqueer and a therapist and I’m so sorry you experienced that! Not all therapists are competent. You owe this therapist nothing. Do whatever you want to take care of yourself. Ghost her, email her, scream at her… and hope you find yourself a therapist who can support you along your journey! ❤️
So sorry that this happened to you. It is great that you came out to your therapist, but terrible that she revealed herself to be an ignorant and blatant transphobe. This is a gift to you because you now know that you must find another therapist. Imagine if she was more subtle and messed with your mind for years? Good on her for being so blatantly obvious with her bigotry. So unprofessional.

Get. Another. Therapist. Now.
This sounds incredibly unprofessional to me. I don't want to jump to conclusions because I don't know the full context, but based on what you've described here I'd say she's a bad therapist. Not only is she not supposed to give you advice and tell you how to live, she's also not supposed to let her personal opinions and ignorance interfere with your therapy. If I were you I would quit immediately - it sounds like she is not interested in doing research to gain perspective and be more trans-literate. It would be incredibly hurtful and damaging for the client (you) in the long run, or even short-term.
Go to one more session... And record it. Keep that record and pass it on (in some places you may need her consent to record... In which case, you can force her to admit she doesn't REALLY believe what she's saying is legit).
In some places, this may be enough to get her in serious trouble. Damn.
Op what’s your region? If you live in cali specifically OC my therapist is nonbinary goes by she/they and they have tons of recourses on therapists who are super loving and helpful I also know another therapist cis woman who’s queer and although she herself isn’t trans she fully supports and hears everything lovely woman also does emdr therapy to help release trauma trapped in the body
🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩 If a therapist ever makes you feel like they aren't listening to you, they aren't doing their job right. Start looking for a new therapist.
All that u are saying fits my feelings so well. I get a major dysphoria when someone just assumes my gender. I have never felt like a girl nor a boy even before I was just putting on make up to fit in not cause I wanted to. I think the last time I put on make up was when I was 16. I am 25 now. Or wear certain clothes to fit in or act a certain way. Now I am like h*ll if I care what people think of me. (Does not help my dysphoria when someone adresses me as girl, woman, dauther, she or her tho). I have not come out to my parents or familly cause I don't feel the need to. I think deep down they will always see me like that. But I have come out to friends and they are all supportive. I have my pronouns in my bio's of my socials so probably familly who pay attention will see that I guess.
hell no. definitely stop seeing her, like don't even go to the next session. 

like the fact that she just went directly into ""attack mode"" instead of taking a nonjudgmental perspective of hearing you out, is just bad. 

when you get a new therapist they should def hear about this too. what your (hopefully former) therapist did was a total breach of trust. good therapy relies on trust. what she did was harmful.
Depending on what country you're in there are boards you can report her to. The only good that can come out of this is making sure she doesn't do it to anyone else.

I'm sorry you went through this and I hope it doesn't put you off from therapy altogether. I went through a series of therapists that just didn't fit at all until I landed with my current one who is queer herself/very knowledgeable of the queer community and I've been seeing her now for 8 years. I for sure recommend looking into therapists that specialize in LGBTQ+ care going forward. Best of luck
Hi friend, another enby therapist here. I agree with others that she should be reported to her college if you're up for it, not just because of her disgusting and completely unethical transphobia and homophobia but also because of the way she gave you private information about her friend's son. He isn't her client so technically she didn't break confidentiality but it's still completely unprofessional to talk about someone else's medical procedures and to show their photo without their consent. So gross. You deserve SO MUCH BETTER this woman needs to know that this behaviour is not only unprofessional but actively harmful.
I would start looking for a new therapist immediately and also let her know why you don't want to see her again. While I doubt this will make her reflect on her words and do some actual research, she should know that you felt hurt and offended
Spend some time searching for a therapist that specifically works with trans/NB people. I try to do this with any medical provider I will have an extended relationship with. I’ve just heard too many horror stories about our interactions with the medical system. 

Do not go back to that therapist, though.
Did you choose your therapist? I ask because some don't have that privilege. If you do, please change your therapist.
That’s just a bad therapist period. My husband is in school to be a counselor and there’s just so many red flags. Sorry you went through that. There’s definitely a counselor that can help you so much better. My therapist is one of my biggest supporters.
This sounds unacceptable and really traumatising to have to go through this. I'm sorry you've had such a shitty exchange with your therapist. You deserve so much better. I'm a therapist myself and unfortunately it seems to be common to find transphobic therapists. I'm always worried for any trans person. If you want help reporting your therapist please let me know. I'd be more than happy to help!
Exactly what you said. 
It makes me so professionally offended when  I see these posts. People are vulnerable with them, they claim to be a professional, and then they treat people like this. It makes my blood boil
Exactly
not a mental health professional but if you don't want to really talk at all you could cancel and cite refusal to acknowledge Gender Dysphoria to start a paper trail. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/symptoms-causes/syc-20475255
will do
yah and if she did it to op she'll probably do it to others
 I think the therpist was trying to say that being nonbinary is hard which I get but you can't just choose not to be yourself. not being yourself is a lot harder in the long term
This bitch straight up did malpractice. Seconding reporting her.

[But OP, please don't feel pressured to report her. Take care of yourself first.]
i don’t think so 😔 she works independently, so there’s no one else to go to
Just hopping in to add that yes if she is a licensed professional the governing body for her certification has a way to report. The ACA is an example, NASW as well
Same, I barely could read all of it, imagine being there to experience it! Sounds like hell. Please OP be safe and find a new therapist, everything about this was just SO wrong 😵‍💫
They're not supposed to. This is definitely against the ethics code and they need to be reported.
yeah i thought so too
i was just about to say that! archeologists say this all the time. they have to guess on what they were buried with, that’s all they can really go off of
oh thanks for telling me, i wasn’t aware of that
yeah my mum has said that she’s willing to learn about it, and she’s going to help me get top surgery :)
Depending on where you are you could try looking online for a queer friendly therapist, or even a queer therapist. There’s a few resources like the Trevor project and PFlag that you might be able to use to find a good therapist.
sorry to hear that, i hope you’ll be able to find someone good soon, maybe online?
it was bizarre to witness, she just pulled out every typical transphoic argument in the book
I’m sorry this happened to you, I hope you have or find someone better to talk to who supports you 💚
Sunflower seeds may help lower blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar as they contain vitamin E, magnesium, protein, linoleic fatty acids and several plant compounds.
before doing this OP: please research your areas laws on recording people sans consent in private settings. no matter how horrendous this woman is, it is not worth you getting into legal trouble.
Glad to hear you're leaving, no one should have to hear that from their therapist. Wishing you the best!
She has a licence I assume. That means an agency is regulating her. You can report her to that agency.
Maybe find sites to leave a bad review?
Here in the UK I believe it’s covered by the HCPC!
Me too! I also thought that she was projecting. She sounds like a very unhappy person who chose at some point to just repress her gender dysphoria and lean into social gender norms. 

When people have true self assurance they don’t beat your round the head with their world view. You accepting their world view or not has no bearing on their own opinion of themselves.

Self assurance is quiet. 

However, when people rely on external structures, such as societal values, gender norms, markers of status, etc, to bolster their sense of self, challenging those structures challenges their self concept and they go ballistic. 

I guess it is extra surprising from a “therapist” because one of our expectations of them is that they must have spent time looking inward and finding that deeper sense of themselves. But, I hear so many stories about bad therapists, I guess they didn’t all get the memo.

Sorry you had to go through that. 

But for what it is worth from an outside perspective you were clearly the person operating from a deeper sense of self knowledge and wisdom. While she was lashing out irrationally and from a place of insecurity. She was placing more value on the seeming of her own life than the being of her own life. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. You caring about being yourself more than seeming to be what society expects was threatening to her. She sounds deeply and desperately unhappy and you will do well to get clear of her.
Also especially since they’re going off of how the bones develop depending on muscle attachments and that humans aren’t that sexually dimorphic making it very difficult to sex people in general
Hopefully maybe! A Millennials would be nice
Pulled out the greatest hits, one after another. It’s clear cut
I hope you do as well.💞
Happy cake day
i’ll see what i can do
Cheers!
Please know this isn’t your fault. You don’t have a duty to report her but hopefully it will prevent someone else getting hurt. I hope you’re doing okay ❤️
If you're in the US, this looks like a useful guide: https://blog.opencounseling.com/check-a-therapist-license/

Binary trans to non binary?	"Did anyone else go from a binary trans identity to a non binary identity?

I have been out a FTM for the past like 4 years but I’m beginning to feel, I guess almost a reverse dysphoria about being so so so masculine. I was comfortable for a while but I’m starting to think I don’t enjoy being seen as a man much and I may be more feminine/in the middle.

It is extremely difficult because my transition thus far has been testosterone and top surgery and I am worried I made some mistakes now that I’m not sure if I am a binary man. I get very panicky because it’s not like I want to detransition and be a woman or anything, but i am not as comfortable with he/him and being perceived as a man all the time.

This is very scary because I have put so much effort into passing and being a man and for a while I was very comfortable but now I feel differently.

Did anyone else face this or something similar? I really need support"	"You're not de-transitioning. Your transition goals have just changed. You learned more about yourself. That's a good thing.
Yup. Transfem enbi here, and i get dysphoria whenever I’m too feminine or too masculine like you do. The balance is quite difficult, i have days i can’t even wear makeup at all, then i get dysphoria from feeling too masc 😩
First off, this sounds really tough! I feel for you. For a long time I thought I couldn't be trans at all because when I tested out trans man it felt as wrong as being a cis woman did. I think a lot of people got stuck with feeling a need to be one or the other. Society is still very stuck on the binary, and it can be so hard to realize the binary isn't the truth.

I don't think you made the wrong choices for you at the time. Lots of afab nonbinary people also use T and get top surgery! I'm planning bottom surgery too. And even though I haven't even gotten a date for my first top surgery consult, I'm already researching prosthetic breast forms, so I can have both shapes.

 But also...

Trans men are allowed to be feminine! We praise cis men for exploring their feminine sides. As a trans man, you deserve the same. You can absolutely live your life ""less masculine"" and still be 100% a man. You can wear skirts and makeup and do ""girly things"" and still be a man. 

And I don't mean drag — you can mess with gender norms in your daily life whatever your gender is.

Maybe being a man feels wrong right now because you're putting pressure on yourself to conform to a certain type of manhood that isn't *your* manhood. Do you think letting yourself be a feminine man for a whole might ease up some of the pressure?

We are always discovering more about ourselves and whether you're a man or nonbinary, you are valid. Taking the long road to finding yourself is OK. The amount of time it takes to be your true self is morally neutral — it's not bad or good to take a detour on the way; it just is what it is.
I think for me it was a big step when I realized that gender can be very fluid. You can feel completely comfortable as a man for a few years and then feel more comfortable as nb for a few years. It's okay for your identity to change and your current identity doesn't invalidate any of your past identities and vise versa. I was a he/him trans man for five years and I was fully a man and was on T and had top surgery. Now I'm a she/they genderqueer and I don't think that makes my physical transition any less worth it.
I actually had a similar experience, as have many other people I know. A lot of us actually *do* identify as detrans in some way, but it doesn't necessarily mean we're desisted from trans identity. Just that we had to course-correct for a transition that was too binary. A lot of people are really misinformed by TERFs on what detrans people can be like, so it can be scary to have an experience that could be ""counted."" But rather than tell you ""that's not detransition"" I'd present to you instead the knowledge that lots of detrans NB people in this exact situation exist, and it's up to you if you consider yourself one of us or not. You don't have to give up being trans to reverse or change your transition, regardless. 

I went on HRT for long enough that I started getting dysphoric about some of the changes. I stopped for a few years, but my intersex variation caught up to me and I had to go back on, so I'm sort of working with the same situation that no-E transfem people are, in the end? Having to work with what I got even if it feels like it's kinda working against me. It's fine. 

Medical transition doesn't have to be gender-affirming. It can be something you regret or had a mixed or rough experience with. That's ok. You can always course correct and move forward.
I felt that but at a hyper compressed timeline. I wanted to be a full blown woman, then I stepped back to non-binary. Honestly, I think my resting point is going to be genderqueer (GNC) trans woman.

Edit: thought I might explain. I feel like my _identity_ is a binary woman but my _expression_ is fluid/non-binary (whatever i feel, whenever i feel). So the social element of my gender is why I picked the label genderqueer.
When I came out, I came out as non-binary transmasc. I thought about identifying as a male and that just never felt right to me. I never wanted to be placed back into the box of gender and have tons of societal expectations on my shoulders about how I should and shouldn’t behave, dress, etc. I’ve got a beard, most everyone identifies me as a man, but I know that I’m not.

I don’t want the weight of having to perform masculinity to society’s standards. And you shouldn’t have to either.
i had a very similar experience, just in reverse. i came out as a trans woman when i was 15, and for so long passing was the most important thing to me. i even used to have nightmares about my hair being cut because i thought it would make me look like a man. well at 19 i had pretty much accomplished my goal. i was never misgendered, never given a side eye in the women’s restroom, and. it sucked. it felt like i was just as trapped in that binary as when i was presenting as a man. 

now i’m 20, i’ve shaved off all my hair, i wear masculine clothes when i want to, i use they/them pronouns, and i’ve never felt more free. it was terrifying at first, because i thought people would think i was detransitioning and i occasionally get called “sir”, but now even being called “sir” doesn’t bother me. 

so let me just say, it will be scary, and i know it’ll be weird inching away from masculinity, but you’ll be okay.
People are saying all kinds of great stuff here that I totally agree with. Just want to add though that we aren't static as people and our gender identities and/or presentations can change over time.
Yep, me! I was a binary trans man for 5 years and am now non-binary. I am “retransitioning” (term I prefer to detransitioning) by going off HRT. I regret some choices and the societal urge to present fully masc. I am now accepting being non-binary for me looks different than my body does now. I got terrible dysphoria from being clocked as a cis man. I’ve found a lot of support in r/actual_detrans which has quite a few folks who go from binary to non-binary trans identities, TERFs aren’t allowed, and it’s a safe place for me to talk about questioning my level of transition (but not being trans), and what I can do to change my presentation in another direction. You’re not alone.
I identify as both FTM and nonbinary, I think it’s just a journey of learning more about yourself. Personally I have some days where being hyper masc sets of dysphoria and some days where it’s euphoric. Some nonbinary folks want testosterone and top surgery too! It could be a case that now that physical dysphoria has gone you’re still discovering what makes you comfortable in other ways.
Even if you were to entirely detrans, as long as you understand that it was a view in your self that has been altered and isn't a fault within the trans community it is okay. 

It's okay to learn more about yourself and realize the information you had previously may not have been enough or you may have taken them in the wrong direction. That's okay! We all do it at times.
I did the exact same thing. After I had been in T and legally changed my name and gender, had too surgery etc. I realized I still enjoyed being feminine when dating straight men. There was a nostalgia about makeup and hair that I missed. 

So I stopped T and stopped cutting my hair. Bought some feminine clothes and wore them, painted my nails, put on makeup, raised my voice a little. Turns out a lot of what I did was to totally reversible. I swung really hard back to fem for about a year and now I’m back to an in-between: short hair, on T, mostly masc clothes but I do still present as very fem sometimes. 

I don’t love being non-binary yet, I have some internalized non-binary-phobia. But I have accepted that I don’t fit in a female box or a male box. I present how I feel and that’s pretty fuckin rad. Looking back I have always done what I felt was right for me at any given point in my transition(s) and that helped me to stop regretting things I did. Now I’m back to appreciating my top surgery and short hair :)
I've been having these same worries. I am a transfem enby and there are days where I just look at myself like ""did I make a mistake?""
Yup, not me, but I’ve seen it plenty. It’s ok for your identity to evolve. I can see the social pressure to be a binary man once you’ve made it that far as to be seen as one in the world. Also remember that man/woman don’t mean the same as masc/fem. You can still be a man if that how you feel but you don’t have to be masculine in ever way, at all times. That’s true for cis guys too, they just often reject it. 

Whatever you do, just be you! Categorization is overrated.
I identified as a binary trans woman for about the first year of my transition. 

Somewhere in there I got the feeling I was trying to ""kill off"" some intrinsic parts of myself and measure up to standards of dress/beauty that, while not in/of themselves are wrong, were harmful for my mental health. 

I now foe the last year have identified as a nonbinary transfeminine person and am very comfortable with my gender identity in a way I wasn't before. 

It's a totally valid experience as gender, for some of us, proves to be a moving target
This is how I discovered I was non-binary. I think it’s pretty normal
Even if you were detransitioning it would be perfectly okay, but it sounds like that's not what you're looking for. Often we're pushed to call ourselves binary trans in order to get access to the medical transition we need and it's completely understandable if you didn't realize you were nonbinary at first. I feel like this would've happened to me if I hadn't already known I'm nonbinary when I first started testosterone.

Just take it one step at a time and don't worry about how other people see your transition. And good luck.
I just wanted to say, this is such a brave and vulnerable share!

When there's potential criticisms towards our experience, it can be much easier to keep quiet. You being so brave is a gift for a huge group of people who relate and now feel less alone💜

Love to you, beautiful soul!
One of my friends, who's always been non binary but transitioned into looking more masculine, has decided to somewhat detransition to look more androgynous. I'm not completely aware of their journey but I could look into it and ask them questions to help you if you want?
Yeah. Genderfluid to agender to ftm to nonbinary. Been an interesting ride.
I identified as ftm for about 7 years! I now identify as nonbinary,  and seeing someone going through something similar to me is quite comforting. I ended up feeling like testosterone wasn't making me better, shaved my beard, and slowly got more adventurous. Be it my nails, doing my hair differently,  and buying more feminine clothing. 
There's nothing to panic about,  especially since gender is such a difficult thing to figure out.
Nonbinary IS trans
I thought I was simply a trans woman, and have been on hrt for the last six months. As I continue to unpack things, however, I realize that I'm actually fluidflux, with a gender that orbits femininity without ever settling down there.

There are days when I feel more masc and the feminisation of my body feels weird, but overall it still feels like the right thing to do, so I'm focusing on presentation changes to help with the dysphoria when that happens.
So I can talk to you about the experience of my friend, a transmasc enby (or ""polygender"" but this is getting more complicated). They identified more or less as enby since the beginning of their transition but that didn't stop them from taking testosterone. They even used mainly he/him at some point. But now they're more comfortable as ever in their non-binarity, and they state testosterone as one of the reasons.
Isn't that an interesting part of how this works. 
I'm M2F but had similar feelings about my birth gender, and have at times since transitioning definitely felt dysphoria the other way.
My personal solution is to just roll with it and generally speaking I just follow my euphoria wherever it leads..

Sometimes I also feel quite neutral,  which is also fine.

I think part of it is to separate mental from physical. 

Physically I can be doing something masculine or feminine, mentally I'm enjoying getting my nails done if I'm her, or I don't have time for this crap if I'm him.

There will always be times where I feel some level of dysphoria, that's OK, also for me my masculine half is big a powerful, and sometimes I need my protector back, so I reserve the right to bring him back anytime I need him without guilt or shame.

I don't know how it works from the other side, but if there are times you want to be soft and pretty or whatever fem means to you, then just be you and that's more than enough.

You still Da'Man, or maybe Da'Nonbianry. 

There's 50 shades of trans, so just find the balance that works for you.
I've definitely drifted from more feminine to more non-binary over time, although still leaning towards feminine. But then I always thought of myself as a tomboy, so I guess that tracks haha
Same here! Thought I was a binary trans man for years and had been on T a year. You’re definitely not alone :)
One of my siblings is currently going through this, so you're definitely not alone 💕
Literally same thing happened to me, I swung too far masculine and had to readjust my transition goals to something that felt more “me”. Now I’m FtN or FtX and use they/them pronouns instead of he/him.
Yeah, I know lots of people who've followed that path! There's no shame in it!
You might be more genderfluid as well. I was happy to identify as NB when I first came out, but am on T now and wondering if I'm a repressed trans man instead.  Sometimea though I feel like I miss my feminine side and feel weird for ""feminine"" gestures for example (until I remember all the fabulous gay men in the world) and realize that I am me and sometimes that presents one way or is interpreted another way by others. I actually think I'm a genderfluid Wizard who shape shifts depending on circumstances and mood. Definitely a delicate balance, but my new transition goal is to stay present with myself and do what feels most like me, knowing that it is all me. Hang in there. It isn't easy, but it can be really fun at times.
No worries. Gender identities can shift over time. I'm gender queer and somewhere smack dab in the middle between the binaries. All I ever knew growing up was that I didn't identify as being female or feminine but I didn't identify as male either, so I was always stuck as female till I realized there was another option other than just ""tomboy"". Learning about yourself is a process.
I'm still finding my comfortable spot when it comes to gender expression. I feel pretty solidly non-binary, but my expression is quite fluid. I don't feel like I have any useful advice to offer, but I do want to thank you for making this post. There's a wealth of wisdom and great advice here and I feel a lot more comfortable after reading through the discussion. I hope it's done the same for you 😊.
I (35) thought at first I may be a trans man (summer '20). I liked binding and all but the thought of being a trans man felt off.    

Then last spring I found out about nonbinary and later it being an umbrella term. Then later than all that, I found out about trans-fem & trans-masc.   

Later I felt I identified with Agender trans-masc. Because, although I don't want cis people assuming my gender. If they decide to pick one, I'd prefer they'd assume I'm a man. Plus there is
/r/FTMfemininity and some TikTokers who are trans men that wear dresses & skirts. Which seeing them gives me gender euphoria.     

To note I do want top surgery (no nips) and on a low dose of T. Then I plan to re-evaluate where I'm at and how I'm feeling. Because we're human and constantly changing. It's the spice of life.
Maybe check out the YouTube channel heycolanda? They’re a nb couple who were on testosterone for a while and eventually quit. I know one of them wants top surgery.
Don’t worry too much about it, you’re not making “mistakes”. You’re learning
more about yourself as you go. Everyone’s journey is different:)
I also see enbies who realise after some time that they are binary trans, so why shouldn't it be the other way around? Figuring stuff out takes time, and I don't see transitioning as a fixed way anymore. Every transition is different and it's totally ok if you're taking longer, taking less time, take turns, even go backwards. Gender is fluid :)
While I can’t relate to what you are going through exactly, I can hard related to the feelings of panic and identity confusion on the topic- I’ll share my experience in the hopes that maybe you’ll feel a little less alone/more validated. 

My agab is female- But I never fit into that box. I was aware of my love and attraction for women reaching back to my earliest memories and, before we really had words like nonbinary and before I had the framework to think about it the only option available to me for a long time was gender non-conforming butch lesbian. I never really thought about my gender tho- just my sexual orientation which was 100% women. And i learned how to be a good butch and what made women happy/what was expected of me. 

In the early 2000’s the informed consent model for HRT made transitioning and getting HRT suddenly exponentially more accessible (thank god) to transgender individuals. But it was actually a little jarring for me because it really felt like overnight all of the butch lesbians I knew were now trans men (I know they were always men, but this was how it felt at the time). Everyone expected that I was going to transition, which i never had any interest in doing, and I remember have feelings about “butch erasure” and i remember feeling really acutely that there was no place for me anymore. 

We were still all thinking in terms of binary gender tho- I knew I wasn’t a man, so by default I figured this must mean i am a woman. It wasn’t until maybe 5 years later when I started working at a clinic that specialized in transgender medicine and listening to people talk about feeling so strongly male or female that I realized I didn’t “feel” any sense of gender- I could not understand what people meant by this. I was fine in the space of “genderless butch lesbian” for another 10 years. 

I’ve always had varying degrees of mild dysphoria at various times in my life, but more around wishing I had something (a man’s chest or a penis) but never wanting to be rid of what I had. And i would have a sense of certain things - like I didn’t want to be a mom I wanted to be a dad. Again, I was still thinking in binary. But I never had any desire to live in and present as male in the world day to day. 

Anyways, 5 years ago I meet this pansexual woman who in one sentence turned my world upside down. I can’t even remember the context but I made some reference to my “butchness” as a reason for something and she said “I don’t care if you’re butch or not, I’m pan”. Well, who knew, all those years I had just been performing butch because it was what was expected of me, all of a sudden this ginormous weight was lifted and I was freed of this huge burden I had no idea I was carrying. 

She took it even further and started to really encourage and support me in my masculinity and this made me feel safe to explore my femininity as well. Through this process I discovered that I am agender most of the time but sometimes very genderfluid, especially when it comes to sex. 

Cue identity crises at the age of 35- my labels that i was so secure in didn’t fit right any more, and what i wanted and needed from a partner changed too. I’m still working it all out, and when I feel threatened or insecure I still sometimes retreat back behind the armor or butch lesbian because even though it doesn’t fit right anymore I’ve worn it so long when i put it on it’s impenetrable (if that makes any sense). I’m trying to figure out where and with whom I fit now, and i sometimes feel guilt and shame about that, and i sometimes feel terrified that I will never find a partner that will love all parts of me and my gender and that I will settle out of fear. 

Coming from a place of someone who had what they thought was a rock solid identity for 20 years this shit is hard, and it’s confusing, and apparently it can change throughout your life or as you get a new framework or point of reference. I have no answers, but at least you’re not alone and at the end of the day figuring out what feels good and right for you is more important than what anyone thinks or wants or expects about you.

Edit- some spelling and punctuation for easier reading/clarification
Kinda opposite? I'm starting think I'm trans instead of nb after thinking I was nb first
Lots of people re-transition. There's still a lot of pressure in the community for binary transition. There's a long his story of denying trans health to third gender people as well, so lots went with the program in order to get needed care. There's now more space to be nonbinary, so it's easier to identify properly.
Hey, I am in the very same boat as you I think.

I came out with 14, almost 10 years ago, started T with 18 and I stopped taking it last February after panicking about my identity throughout the pandemic. 
4 years on T and I realized it wasn't right for me anymore. 

I know I am 100% trans, not detransitioning, I really don't feel like a women but heck I don't feel like a man either. 

And I guess you are going through simlair things rn.

Feeling super confused and lost after going through all those hurdles and stressors, possibly fighting with parents, just to realize you might missed something is really scary.

But I think it is quite common, normal, human. In all points of live, not just transition. We are after all very clumsily trying to figure out who we are as people. 

Things will be okay I am positive of that. Give yourself time and try to navigate what you want for yourself now.



If you wanna Chat or something, feel free to DM me ☺️
I had the same thing. I felt like being non-binary was bad for a long time so clearly my only option was to transition to female. That didn’t last obviously
ha this happened to me very recently. identified as ftm for about four years, now i'm agender. i'm even happier with my new identity than my old one. stuff changes i guess. hope you find something you're comfortable with soon for your sake
I transitioned from feminine > masculine > androgynous personaly. Was FTM but now I’m definitely non-binary. I was on T but now I consider myself a non-binary lesbian.
Honestly this happened to me the more I learn about gender, and how its a social construct like. I feel like a boy, but not a Man. I dont fit into societies expectations kf a man so im not the same gendee as peopl usually mean when they say man, even if u desire a traditionally male body and like he/him pronouns. Idk if i explained well
even though I'm transfem i feel this a lot. I never started medically transitioning because i live in an eastern european hellhole but when after suppressing myself for 4 years i managed to accept I'm trans. And i concluded that I must be mtf and all this enby stuff was just a coping mechanism (spoiler it wasn't) but the idea of being a woman also caused me dysphoria as much as being a man. I later accepted that I'm non binary and it was that simple all along. This is just my personal experience though. and as someone else said in the comments, men can be feminine too if they want to be, what's important is to feel comfortable in your skin and clothes. you can present however you want and it will never invalidate your identity <3 I wish you luck on your journey of self discovery.
for me it was just that i didn’t like being labeled as a gender because neither for me well enough. i transitioned from cis male to genderfluid to non binary.
I think our idea of gender is always changing and what we’re comfy with is always adapting. Give yourself some grace and love as you go through this journey
You aren’t alone! So thankful for transition and I identify as non-binary trans masc but I feel you! I want to express my non-binary-ness more and not present as a cis-guy (heaven forbid Lolol!)
This is totally normal! I honestly think about this all the time as someone who's been out as a trans man for over a year now. Gender is such a strange thing and I genuinely think it can be helpful to just say fuck all labels for a while and do whatever you want. My biggest fear regarding changing my label is that people will stop referring to me using male language - ae man, guy, boyfriend, etc. But at the end of the day it really only matters what the people you love refer to you as :)
You're not alone, friend.  


I did my best impression of the binary trans girl thing for my first five or so years of transition, but in hindsight, I feel like I was afraid of being seen as too queer. Transitioning at all was a step in the right direction, but I'm more comfortable focusing on what I need to do to alleviate dysphoria rather than picking a box or side to fit into.  


Change can be scary, but I'm proud of you for talking about these feelings and hope you're able to move towards greater comfort.
I flip flopped between trans woman, and cis man for years before transitioning, and realizing I am non-binary. Still not 100% sure on my gender. Try not to stress about fitting into some mold, and do what makes you feel best. I felt like I needed to change my name, and ditch he/him pronouns at the start but realized I didn’t have to just to be trans enough.
I was in a similar boat, thought I was a trans man but trying to be masculine felt just as forced as living as a girl. There’s no need to feel guilty about it, you just needed to explore your identity a little bit more.
For sure this is a thing. I can't say I got dysphoria from transitioning to binary female, but I've gotten a lot of euphoria from going back towards appearing more androgynous.

I think a lot it is that when I first started transitioning like 12 years ago, being nonbinary wasn't well known or understood. I didn't have the language to know and express that I'm nonbinary. I have that language now though, and I've adjusted my presentation to meet those needs.
Check out r/ftmfemininity they're a great sub for trans guys to accept themselves still liking some feminine aspects of their identity.
I’m a non-binary person who is on T and had top surgery, if those things make you happy then you don’t have to stop/revert because you no longer ID as a man. If T doesn’t make you happy anymore then feel free to go off it. There is no one way to be trans and non-binary, so whatever makes you happy and comfortable in your body is the right thing ❤️
Identity is a complex thing that can change. Maybe yours has changed. There's nothing wrong with that.
Do trans guys have to be cis or binary in nature? That seems a bit disingenuous to me. Someone aptly put it in an NB/TransMasc interview I watched, if we are to support cis AMAB males’ rights to use makeup or to wear pink, then we ought not judge trans under such harsh and militant terms as a means of proving their validity as males. 

I cannot speak for you and I am sure that your experiences and feelings are not inherently based on superficial factors like those used in the example above. Those were on the point of making it clear that you dont have to be what is considered masculine (gender expression) in order to be trans (gender identity), so as to debunk any of those common “toxic masculinity” footholes anyone is capable of falling into.

My ID is NB/TransMasc so, if you would like to talk on those points then feel free to DM me. Gender isnt always so straightforward, same as sexuality, and I dont feel anyone should have to be sworn in for life just because they have discovered a true part of themselves in one, and then later on discover another truth of themselves elsewhere. Easier said than done but it is all a part of the journey of self-acceptance.
I think k a lot of people who aren't cis experience this pendulum swing, where in the beginning it's kind of thrilling to see yourself successfully pull off a feminine/masculine/androgynous etc presentation, but as time goes on that can start to feel like another performance. As you become more comfortable with who you are, there's less pressure to prove to others (or yourself) you're that. You get to just be.
It's more common than you think. Me and my boyfriend when from trans girls to he/theys over quarantine
yep!! i used to identify as a binary trans man, but now i’m identifying as a genderqueer transmasc :)
i know a bunch of trans masc people who feel like you, OP! i can relate as well (altho i’ve never passed as a dude).
Masculinity is as much a spectrum as any gender. David Bowie, Prince, Boy George...to name a few men who blur(ed) the line.


Either way, being nonbinary doesn't undo the progress you've made.
Hi I’m non-binary but usually ftm groups feel more my vibe. It’s hard trying to navigate a very binary mainstream and finding oneself, and it’s valid for us to feel different ways at different points in our lives. 💓 I’ve just (3 months ago) got top surgery! And am on low dose T.
gender is fluid! have you thought of trying he/they?
I think I can relate, OP. I’m two years on T Identifying as a trans guy using he pronouns and I’ve been experiencing an increasing amount of anxiety trying to make it all fit but it feels complicated. I started out using he/they but they made me feel dysphoric like I wasn’t being taken ‘seriously’ as on the guy side of things and I really wanted to feel that male homosociality so I just started using he/him only. I love everything T has done for me but I still get my period and it’s been making for some major mood swings/dysphoria/insecurity in a weird way I wonder if it’s affecting my mental health…I have a big anxiety that somehow T is wrong for me even tho I love it’s effects and that’s why I’ve been so anxious and depressed…what I really feel is fragmented: like transitioning has made me push the more female or feminine parts of me inside and then they come bubbling up when I’m alone sometimes and I’ll suddenly feel SO female it freaks me out…then on good days or out among people I just feel like my guy-ish self again…which has never been a strong identity for me, more of a desire to occupy that gendered place. so the compartmentalization freaks me out, and makes me wonder if I’m confused or repressed or just didn’t integrate my past identity right and it’s coming back to bite me. When others talk about how easy and happy and confident they feel since transitioning I doubt myself. I love my name and masculine presentation but I still feel like I’m faking some days, tho the idea of going back to female or feminine makes me sick and panicky, it’s not what I want in any form. I just want to understand these parts of myself I understand as non-male, and integrate them in a way that lets me feel confident dating queer men as a man-ish person. As it is I’m so terrified of feeling like I’m ‘faking’ a male identity around gay men it won’t let me go out and date any of them and it’s been a huge problem as I’m really lonely and feel undateable. I feel like I should be dating like, bi-curious straight men in this weird way so I can be my full self. Most of this is in my head I think and if I could just meet some guys who I felt could see my sort of ambigenderedness and be attracted to it I’d feel a lot better and not worry if I’m making a mistake.
Thank you I needed to read that
This answer though 🥰🥰🥰🥰 yasssss ❤❤❤

Thank you so much OP for sharing 🖤
This, I've changed in the same way
I know it’s such a struggle, I try and do one thing and the next day I don’t like it lmaoo
It's affirming to read someone's experience is similar to my own
Dude you don’t even understand how much this reply means to me. You’ve given me a lot to think about and I’m feeling a bit less like a total weirdo, especially because I was looking for prosthetic breasts as well but I was so worried no one who ever would get top surgery would ever look for that and I thought I was A total freak for it, so thank you so much just for responding here. I really really appreciate this and I’ve got a lot to contemplate and I’m feeling a lot more comfortable now
Thank you, that means a lot. I really need to work to achieving that mindset. Seriously, thanks <3
Yes that’s really how I’m feeling, I hate all the gender expectations I want to get away from them
Thank you. I’ll check out that sub, I appreciate your reply
happy cake day
You are already whole, my friend 🖤
[deleted]
We’re thousands feeling the same and not being very talkative about it, phobia is a thing even in the trans community
Transmasc nonbinary here, on T, looking for top. Honestly that's my ideal chest situation, having the option for boob or no boob. Top surgery takes the limiter off of your chest customization options imo.
It's a long process! I'm so glad the comment helped.

I started openly identifying as nonbinary and seeking physical changes at 35, and before that I spent like a solid 5 years researching and considering first. Honestly, I wish I'd moved faster and risked more ""mistakes"". But I can't change the past so I'm making the best of now. I'm enjoying my girly librarian hair buns with my new facial hair, and my flowy poofy skirts with man-hair legs. It might take me the rest of my life to truly become myself but as long as I'm working towards it, I'm OK with that.
💚
Thanks!
I haven’t but I’m definitely going to check that out now, and that sucks there isn’t one for transfems, someone should make that, thank you for showing me this
I've started to move more towards trans spaces where there is no rigid division between trans and nonbinary identities and where it's absolutely accepted that you can move from a more binary way of transitioning to a more nonbinary one and vice versa. I might have been too long in this bubble cause to me, this would be absolutely no big deal if someone who identified as binary trans previously came out as nonbinary. The same amount of respect and love. 

It saddens me deeply that there are still parts of the queer community where this is not accepted. But you are right, we are thousands and taking time to find your gender identity or long term transition goals is not a flaw at all.

(He/They) I’ve felt confident enough in my identity to wear cute dresses without dysphoria lately :)		"You look great! Hope I am able to do this someday too
You look fantastic!  I hope that's me someday.  I tried a sundress this weekend and felt terrible until I changed.
Yay! I'm glad to hear that, because you look lovely in that dress!! You should wear them as often as your comfortable with. ☺️❤️ You look great!
Yeah this is adorable and you are absolutely killing it, you look so cute and summery!
My goodness, you're adorable!!!!
Just paying you a compliment I apologize if I made you feel uncomfortable I was under the impression that everyone in these communities are trying to be positive and uplifting for one another, I'll refrain from making any  further comments towards you
That’s amazing! I’m happy for you
You look cute and handsome at the same time :)
you look amazing! that's a great color on you<33

I didn’t mean to be hostile, I’m just always on edge and trying to stay safe online. Thank you for clarifying your intentions!

Vent: I don’t want to “look NB”	"So I am tired of people telling me that I look/ I don’t look non binary to them. I literally don’t care about it, sometimes I wear dresses, some times I don’t, sometimes I look masc, sometimes femme, sometimes like a muppet.

There’s no way I can express myself like I feel comfortable without someone questioning my looks

Non binary isn’t an aesthetic, no one ever looks non binary, can we just respect that looks aren’t identity?"	"How to look nonbinary:

Step 1: Be nonbinary.

Step 2: Look like yourself.

Congratulations, you now look like a nonbinary person 🎊🎊
A similar peeve of mine is using ""nonbinary"" and ""androgenous"" interchangeably. I present femme, but my sense of self is still nonbinary.
I'm AFAB and dress feminine. Still not cis. Fuck your rules (the 'you' here being society).
Agreed. Along these lines, I wish folks would stop coming in here and other non-binary subs and asking if they look non-binary. It feels like they’re missing the point of liberating themselves from the gender binary.
People always want to get into others' business, especially when it challenges the current norms.  You owe nobody anything with regards to your identity or expression.

Yes, lots of enbies have an undercut or other somewhat typical aesthetic markers, but trying to ascribe to meeting those just ends up creating a distinct third gender, which GNC enbies would likely take issue with.

Screw conventions that you don't personally want to meet, and if anyone questions you, you owe them no answers.
Me: presents like a lumberjack/biker bear

Also me: I'm sorry, did I owe you androgyny?

Bonus me: getting misgendered by the dickhead in the hothatch presumably trying to start a mating ritual by trying to run me off the road.
I love your post so much and feel like this sub needed it. Sounds like you are quite gender ambivalent - not surprising considering it's all made up. 

Recently I find myself sharing more and more of this sentiment, I often dress for function regardless to hire people may perceive me. If I'm hiking I wear outdoor gear, when I'm at home I might wear trackies, if I'm going some place fancy I'll do my makeup and wear patterned trousers, if I'm going clubbing and it's hot is a mesh crop top, if I'm on a date maybe a cute dress. Dress for the occasion, not others perception of you. You'll find your own style faster this way too. 

I'll always be nb, I don't need to prove it to society and I'll validate myself and seek it from other queers I respect when I need it. 

Much love OP, I'm on your team. Take it easy.
My answer to this issue was to look so intimidating that people wouldn't speak up about my appearance for fear that I am unstable. It works well but it probably also helps that I'm unstable.
It's... so fucking frustrating being AMAB and masc-leaning, because a lot of folks just make assumptions about you (usually to the tune of ""you're just an icky cis man"") and either ignore your existence at best, or push you out of queer spaces at worst.
Me, wearing full body compression wear for my heart and joints: my gender is....spandex and vascular health today I guess. 

Some random person: you don't look very aNdRoDgOnOuS today. Guess you're whatever gender I want now!!!

Me: oh sorry allow me to take this off and pass out for u
Same.

90% of my wardrobe is plain, black, or athletic wear… but cut for women. I am embracing simple, comfortable looks. I have spent so much of my life dressing up and obsessing over how my appearance, it’s important to me to just chill on that during this stage of life.
My body is not androgyne and this kinda post asking about looks is depressing to me. I wish I was androgyne...
(Ty for this post)
Someone once told me ""nonbinary people don't owe anyone androgyny"" and it really stuck w/me. Nonbinary is being nonbinary. How we present ourselves to the world is something else.
>sometimes like a muppet

Haha, omg same. This has me rolling. I feel you so much on this. My face shape is just feminine, I can't help it and it doesn't cause me mental health issues but people just love to comment when I say I'm non-binary about how I'm not androgynous enough for them. I've had to get stern and respond with ""I don't owe you my androgyny."" I hate having to be like that but my existence isn't up for a debate. 

I AM non-binary, regardless how others feel.
Exactly. It's basically just people thinking all stereotypes are true, ex: if a masculine presenting man comes out as gay, some people are bound to tell him he doesn't ""look gay"" because he doesn't dress femininely like the stereotypes for gay men say.
This. I know some NB people who are and love to present as strongly masc or strongly femme. Courtney Stodden identifies as NB and is a very female presenting person and is 100% valid the same way a super masc presenting person identifying as NB is valid. 

Self expression is just that, self. 

If some people want to express a gendered or neutral appearance, to look more one way than another, or like to try and find something in between, it’s about what makes them happy and comfortable (not to mention, can be done safely for them, in their situation) 

If someone is NB and goes around with a figure like Marilyn Monroe and full glam hair and make up, they’re still non binary. If someone wants to to rock a thick bushy beard and a big body builder gym ‘bro’ frame but says they’re NB? They’re NB. If someone vibes between, still NB. 

No one needs or is required to look or present anyway except the way they’re happiest
Non-binary people don't owe anyone muppetry

Also I'm really sorry people are telling you whether you look like a gender or not. Imagine how some men would act if you said they didn't look masculine enough? Ffs people are who they say they are and don't owe anyone any looks.
This entire thread is gender euphoria. 

Thank you all.
The ideal of ""Non-Binary"" looks is Cis-Normative conceptualization upon our bodies. We are NB exactly bc their whole construction of world excludes each one of us as individuals while still labeling, fetishizing and tagging us as whatever Society's ""commom sense"" says. There is no such thing as looking NB or not, in fact there is no such thing as looking or not as any cultural identity and period. Literally, this is just one more way the oppressors fuck our lives, we beat them by being us, how we want (or can) and surviving each day. 

And a good reminder that I love repeating:

#NON-BINARY PEOPLE DON'T OWE ANYONE ANDROGYNY!

(Idk, sometimes I want Gandalf's beard with Tsunade's breats and other times being a pile of goo seems fun. Oh, and good luck dealing with all that shit, OP. You are much better than the people trying to mess u like a doll, and all our fellow Enbys...or Enbies...Idk...around here rock too! ☆)
Agreed. I'm masc, and trying on makeup only made me appreciate my looks more. Yes to foundation and V-neck shirts, no to mascara and dresses.
I hate this too. Not sure what it means. I’m nb and trans masc but I guess I present too femme for anyone to get it. My pronoun buttons work really well for this issue though. They can’t say I don’t look non-binary when I’m wearing my they/he pins
Yeah I’m working through this in therapy right now. I’m at a point where I am very happy with my transition. I had top surgery and was on T for several months. I get SO confused when people think I’m a woman. Like….how?
Always remember that we owe no one androgyny.
no exactly… i think people use “non binary” and “androgynous” synonymously when they’re not even the same kind of word. i’m non binary; sometimes i dress super masc; sometimes i dress super fem; sometimes i dress androgynous. sometimes i grow out a mustache for a month or two; sometimes i shave it and wear makeup every day. regardless of what i do, i’m still non binary.
I aspire to look like a muppet
Here to drop some music that encapsulates some feelings in this post: Jake Edwards - Pink & Blue, Ryan Cassata - Gender Binary, Dream Nails - They/Them
I’m autistic, and I am very sensitive to what I wear, and I can’t wear most things. When I find something that doesn’t overwhelm me sensorily, I just wear that until it shreds. I also struggle with change so I almost never go shopping for new things. I currently have two pair of jeans and 10 solid color t-shirts that I bought all at once when I had (finally) found something comfortable. 

I’d LOVE to be able to explore alternative presentations but it’s hard for me. I hate that most people probably won’t “see” me as queer because I basically present as a cis person. I don’t owe anyone any kind of presentation, and I am who I am regardless. And most people I care about already know. I guess I’ve made my peace with it. I’ve recently been exploring painting my nails as that isn’t a sensory burden. I am still hopeful though, maybe someday I’ll find a cute dress that feels comfortable.
i don’t even know if i’m feeling gender dysphoria or just being pushed by nb societal standards because i feel like i have to have this perfect stereotypical androgynous aesthetic for people to respect my identity. and it’s always cis people saying nb people mock trans people if we aren’t perfectly in the center of all gender expression!!
What is nonbinary. 

"" I am me"" 

Yes but what is nonbinary 

""....""
Not necessarily related. Not only is nonbinary NOT a trendy fashion choice but I also wish nonbinary was not trivialized as a phase. I heard so many older cis het folks say oh yeah, if I was born in this time, I probably would come out as nonbinary.

Nonbinary is not a fickle thing you choose lightly.
Holy mother fuck did you say it, I couldn’t agree more.
There is so much variation, in terms of appearance, in the nonbinary world.

I heard this in a podcast: It’s kinda the opposite of the saying “if you’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all”. If you’ve seen one nonbinary person, you’ve seen one nonbinary person.

I thought it was a rather humorous way of putting it.
Yasss this is how I feel. Sometimes I'm Femme, masc... or just a hot mess.

Just dress and be how ever you want
I'm agender I don't want to look nb I don't think nb has a look anyways I want to look like neither gender something totally different but my chest dosent help with that I can't wait to get rid of them. 
but don't listen to others it what you should want to look like
My ex was always pushing me to be more androgynous and I pushed back because of work. Can't just do whatever when my boss wears suits and ties to work still.
Yasss. There's an awesome looking clerk at my grocery (beard, painted nails, long eyelashes, colourful clothes), but I never complimented them on their looks because I wouldn't want to other them. They'd probably rather go about their day without derpy me going ‘heiiiii you so NB’.
No idea why, but I just remembered part of an Eddie izzard routine from way way long ago, she said (they came out a few years back) ""people always say to me"" Eddie, your a guy... Why do you wear womens clothes? I'm like there not womens clothes, they are my clothes, I bought them in the shop with my money so they are not womens clothes, they are my clothes""

Or something like that - it always made me smile :)
Got an enby AMAB relative, they absolutely hate that there are so few masc-presenting Enby's which get celebrated(?), browsing this sub doesn't really help either w/ that. I feel for them as they feel like it's a ""requirement"" due to social pressures, even within a super accepting a tolerant community :\[  


A look, and a way of behaviour don't define Enby. Let's keep the binary out of non-binary.
My take as an agender person.

Imo this is expected. When some take being NB and treat it like the akin Binary people do with their gender, with a sense of property, gatekeeping, and overall seeking some privileges and benefits out of it, such NB people start behaving the same way those Binary people do --because we're not better or worse than them, just from a different gender or lackthereof. Like, there's no safe place inside the community, either, in the same way being a man or a woman may not be a safe place for men and women that don't fit the ideas of certain people inside their same group.

Maybe you shouldn't present as NB if that's not helping you atm, but something more specific inside of being NB. NB is the top definition, but again, in the same fashion a woman or a man that are into a very specific way of being a woman or a man, and will be seemed as 'a certain kind of woman or man', where it's already assumed that they're one or the other, you may not want to go as NB because that's already assumed of you --and then, with that assumed, you're something more specific and understandable for others.

Cheers.
Honestly. People don't understand that being nb involves much more mental than physical
People are stupid even though some of them have good intentions. You don't want to look non binary, whatever that means ? Congratulations, you don't, because you look like you and thats it. People are getting as obsessed as the cis with gendering  everything.
I feel like people say this maybe because they don't know how to compliment trans and non-binary people and I guess on one end they might think it's nice as nonbinary people are so invalidated within the LGBTQ community, however I don't mean to argue against you. I completely understand and relate to your feelings on this subject and hope that people just learn how to give a normal ass compliment that has nothing to do with my identity. OR tell me that I don't look like my identity lol.
People confuse it with being androgynous.
This should be pinned at top of our sub. I consider leaving on the regular due to daily 'do I look NB?', 'am I androgynous enough?',  'guess my gender?', 'what's my agab' posts. 

Babes, we are all here for the same reason and it's nothing to do with how we look. Much love.
Step 1: Be a confused and anxiety-ridden mess  
Step 2: Look like a cis male because you're still afraid of the judgment of others

\*sigh\* I'm getting there, slowly...
Fuck yes
Same ! Well sometimes I'm more masc but whatever my gender expression is, I'm still non-binary.
""thems can be femmes!""
I agree and also understand why it is hard not to ask questions like that, especially early on. Society ties so much of who someone is accepted as based on how they present themselves, and getting out of that mindset can take a lot of work and time.
>trying to start a mating ritual by trying to run me off the road.

...you.  I like you.
Kind of hard to look intimidating when all you want to do is be cute tho :(
Same. Just leave me the fuck alone.
This is a real problem. I don’t think we should ever be divisive - even if most cis straight white men are idiots about us, demonizing each and every cis man isn’t gonna do us any favors AND you should never judge someone by how the present (have we not learned anything lol).
Androgyny is a bunch of BS as much gendered things are, I get your dysphoria and because I feel it too, but we can only change to be who we want to be.

You don’t need to change yourself for anyone except you
Honestly if there WAS an NB ‘look’ or aesthetic it’s …like it’s gonna be muppet, we all know it 🤣
>Imagine how some men would act if you said they didn't look masculine enough? 

From personal experience they'd get quite good at faking it.  That's what I did :/
We love you and you’re valid 💕
We all aspire to be muppets
Non Binary is a gender category made from a queer political viewpoint that rejects the concept of men and woman both as categories assigned at birth and societal norms.

This, is also related to the psique of the individual presenting (in most but not all cases) gender dysphoria to both male and female constructs, this due to an individualization of oneself in a gender-neutral way

Hope it helps explain it as objective as I can get
And for those people that really, really want to know, I feel like they should head to /r/transpassing . It's a thing on other trans subs too, and the reason that sub exists. People do truly worry about how they look and that's just being human, but there's a place for that and it's not here.
OMG I'm right there with you. I tried coming out to my sister last week, and she kindly and lovingly informed me that my reasons are invalid, I'm just making ""style choices"", and I'm wrong. It felt like a gutpunch. Thankfully we were text chatting, because I cried. Other than the three people I told before that, one of whom is my partner, I'm not telling anyone else anytime soon. It takes me a while to recover when I've been slapped down like that.
This hits me right in the heart.

I swear to god, I was in a zoom meeting, full time remote, and when I, one of like 9 people in the call, lifted a coffee cup up and my black nails were visible, the dude presenting started stuttering. It was like if I pulled my top off or something.

After that I got a whole lot more nervous about my nails and anything beyond that... People fucking notice. Something so small, that felt so good at first, became a massive flag for others that I'm probably not cis. It's so weird that the smallest thing can have such a huge cultural impact.

But you know what, fuck them. I'll deal with the anxiety, because it feels better in the end rather than just being anxious and not being me. One day I might go a step farther but for now, this feels closer to me.
Solidarity, friend. We’ll get there one day
You and I, sibling, you and I...
Whoa are you me?
Definitely true!
Just to be clear, however hot 90s James Spader is, I have no desire to be any of the characters from JG Ballard's 1973 book or David Cronenburg's 1996 film adaptation threreof
I feel like the only two people I feel have just inate androgy is Bowie and Tilda Swinton
Haha, I'm down for this to be ""default"" 🤣
I'm a cross between Rowlf and Animal, with a dash of Miss Piggy for glam.
Ahhh fuck I'm sorry. Yeah I get that. I kinda did similar I guess, shitty friends claimed I was a lesbian
Yes that helps me see your perspective. I'm FTX ♡
I'm sorry.  The only person I am close with and therefore care about ""coming out"" to is my wife, and well, her response was basically ""you know I've told you multiple times that I don't really feel like a woman so I get it.""

Most importantly I feel like it's (slowly started to) flip a switch in my head of giving myself permission to do the things I've always told myself aren't ""appropriate"" for an AMAB in today's society.

**EDIT:** I creeped your history a bit and found the post about what your sister said to you and yeah, I feel like I've been saying the same thing to myself to invalidate my own feelings for a while too :(
Haha yeah I feel that.  While I do work from home, we don't use any type of camera so I'm good there.  I feel a little awkward about my blue hair and pierced ears (there will be more, lol) and increasing amounts of jewelry but so far no one has said anything.  Except my wife's boomer aunt who is literally named Karen and admitted to being a sexist bigot and proud of it :(
Probably
Oh you were sarcasming!!!

Hi I’m a parent whose daughter has come to me and said she is thinking about being addressed as they/them.	I love my child no matter what because that’s what being parent means. Can someone please help me to understand why a person makes this choice and what it means. I want to be supportive but I’m quite confused. My mother likes to tell me that I’m letting her be exposed and interact too much with social media thus making her confused since she is already young… and trying to figure out her identity. Then I have this other family member telling me if she truly knew God she wouldn’t have this emptiness inside her and feel like this. I just want my daughter to be happy. I need positive opinions and good solid information please. I’m getting enough negativity from my family and the worries I have in my own head.	"Allowing your child the space and support to explore who they are is the opposite of confusing and the opposite of emptiness. Studies have shown repeatedly that offering gender-expansive kids the room and support to be themselves drastically improves outcomes across the board. You are 100% on the right track in providing that for your kiddo.

I'll say up front that they/them pronouns are just words. They are part of a wide variety of presentation choices that are available to all people, regardless of their gender identity. Cis folks can use they/them pronouns if that's what they feel comfortable with, or binary trans folks. And non-binary people can use she, or he, or any other pronouns they wish. Pronouns, and other forms of expression, are open to everyone. They're choices you make, something you *do.*

A gender identity, in contrast, is an internal experience, something you *are*, regardless of whether or how you choose to express that. I'm non-binary because that's how I feel inside, not because of how I choose to dress or which pronouns I use. My experience of gender is what it is, it's not a choice I make, and it is what is is regardless of how I choose to express it.

So, why do some people feel more comfortable using they/them pronouns? Often it's because they/them is disconnected from a specific gender role stereotype. Sometimes that can just be a fun form of self expression. Other times, it can be an outward reflection of an internal experience of gender that doesn't align solely and completely with either of Western society's gender boxes. We can't see into your kid's soul, so we can't say which is the case in this specific instance. And your kid may not know yet either, and that's okay.

They are likely to get some pushback from folks claiming that they/them is plural only and it's wrong to use them for a single individual. That's actually not true though, for several reasons. Grammar rules for things like whether ""they"" is singular or plural are *descriptive*, meaning they describe how the words are used in common usage. They are not *prescriptive*, meaning they don't define how someone can use a word and if they don't follow the rule then they're ""englishing wrong."" Language is a collaborative experiment in passing information from one person to another, and every individual speaks their own unique dialect of their language. There is no single authority that can declare what is or is not ""proper grammar."" If you're interested in appeals to authority, here are a few that are widely considered the most prominent authorities on how to use English:

- [Merriam Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they) states singular they has been in common grammatical use since the late 1300s and is accepted as correct English.
- [Oxford English Dictionary](https://public.oed.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-singular-they/) is more specific with a citation to 1375, and indicates it was likely in widespread use before it appeared in print. They also consider it to be correct English.
- [AP Style Book](https://www.apstylebook.com/blog_posts/7) explicitly states that using singular they for non-binary and gender diverse individuals is entirely acceptable and appropriate when that's how the person identifies.
- [APA Style Guide](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/singular-they) says that writers *should* use singular they, not just that it's an option. It's the preferred way to refer to people whose gender is unknown or irrelevant, and for people for whom that is the proper pronoun.
- [MLA Style Guide](https://style.mla.org/using-singular-they/) says the same: ""he or she"" should be replaced with they, because it's grammatically acceptable and inclusive, and avoids implicit gender bias in the reader.

Interestingly, these citations show that singular they *predates* singular you.

Does that help a bit?
First piece of advice, **do not let these family members around your child unsupervised if at all**, and if you do allow them around your child, shut down any of that kind of ""you're just confused""/""if you knew god, you wouldn't be this way"" type rhetoric immediately. Don't wait for your kid to do it, don't assume these family members will magically change, make it clear both before and if it comes up that your child is trying to figure out who they are and you are supporting them, that there will not be any bigoted rhetoric tolerated, and lay out clear boundaries with those family members. This, by the way, is coming from someone who came out old enough to handle my family on my own, I wish my mom had been willing to step in for me anyway because the main family member who rejected me is on her side of my family and it stung even knowing it was coming.

Second, try to get used to gender-neutral language, it may take time and that's ok. Your kid might be angry and upset and emotional and might not always be able to communicate in productive ways, that's normal. You didn't mention how old your kid is, I was 15 or 16, and I was scared, angry, and felt very much alone. I felt like no one was willing to work with me, and I lashed out. Now as someone who's turning 24 later this month, I realize I didn't handle it well, I also recognize why I didn't handle it well.

Finally, have conversations about it with your kid when they're ready, make it clear you're willing to talk and to listen when they want to have that conversation. You might be their only ally depending on how things go with others, and it's important to be open and honest that you're trying to support them. If you mess up, apologize and correct yourself, don't harp on it or turn it into ""I'm sorry, it's just"" (something my own mom has done a lot, though she's not the worst and is genuinely trying).
Firstly I wanted to say thank you for coming to a non-binary space to ask us how to help with something like this, it’s too easy to find no welcoming spaces that will try to have you smother your child’s individuality.

Try not to let those family members bully your kid or make snide remarks about them. Kids are being far more open these days about identity stuff and that is great you child is asking for a safe space to start figuring themselves out. They are no different today than they were yesterday they just want to see how being addressed differently makes them feel inside. People will give them crap for it and that will be hard, for both of you. It’s incredibly comforting to have a family member willing to support you as you go to bat for yourself even if they can’t go to bat for you. 

The best way to stop being confused is to explore, that’s what your kid wants to do. None of it needs to have anything to do with religion at all, it’s just a kid figuring out an aspect of their personhood.

I like to be called They/Them because being referred to in the feminine makes me feel disingenuous but being referred to in the masculine doesn’t always feel accurate either, we don’t have options that I find adequately describe who I am so They/Them pronouns are the next best thing and it feels better for me because most people find it easier to pick one pronoun and use it for a person forever though I would not mind so much if more people could use a wife variety of pronouns for me. 

Each individual has their own reasons for wanting to use the pronouns of their choice but that is part of mine, when your child is ready they may discuss their reasons with you.

It’s not being “empty inside” it’s an act of self love and respect to be one’s self as fully as possible, being stifled or mocked and shamed into silence is what causes people to become empty inside.

[here’s a good read](https://medium.com/gender-from-the-trenches/gender-dysphoria-isnt-what-you-think-6fdc7ae3ac85) to be clear not every one of us has dysphoria I just know this article helped me a lot in figuring myself out.
Nonbinary is different for everyone. Your child might feel they are both masculine and feminine, they might feel they are neither... I would say the best you could do for your child is to *let them show you who they are*. Provide them with the safety and comfort they need to express themselves, make sure you clearly communicate that you are a safe person to talk to about anything. 

No one can tell you who they are better than them! 

If you try your very best and still don't get it: *understand that you don't understand*. But understand that from your child's point of view, they might feel that for the first time, they finally understand themselves. Nobody else needs to understand them for that joy they are experiencing to count, but they will appreciate it so much if you make an effort.
It seems like you're coming from a caring position wanting to do the right thing so please don't take this the wrong way but: Stop calling your child your ""daughter"" and ""she"" unless they have told you they're still okay with it. Respect their pronouns and practise using them no matter when and where you speak about them and whether they're present. This will go a long way even if you don't get it right 100% of the time and even if you make mistakes in other aspects of this.

It is important to remember that you don't have to fully understand it in order to just respect their decision. If they tell you something about their identity, believe them.

That being said: Thank you for trying to learn and do right by your kid!
Your kid is asking you to address them as they/ them.  Respect that
https://youtu.be/fYtKXc2VdDw I recommend watching this video, it’s a series on unpacking / debunking a book written by a reactionary who is transphobic against trans men and non binary people. This will help you sharpen yourself against unsupportive family. The “social media is confusing your child” bit is in the book, & addressed by Cass Eris.

Basically, Cass Eris explains that while some platforms are definitely nefarious (meta) children seeking support online is not a bad thing, because they will need that validation from somewhere.

I’m so glad you chose to come here. Because of media like this book, its totally possible for parents looking for support to end up stumbling down a rabbit hole of transphobia.
Most of the time, people who use they/them pronouns are non-binary, meaning their gender identity isn't strictly male or female. It could be both, neither, or something else entirely. Pronouns aren't the same thing as gender identity, though. The pronouns someone uses are the pronouns that feel the most comfortable for them, mostly because they align with their gender identity, but not always.

That being said, I'm surprised no one here has mentioned the possibility of dysphoria. One reason that it's important to use the correct pronouns is that many trans and non-binary people have a mental health condition called gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is when someone experiences distress when either their body or the way they are perceived doesn't match their gender identity. Not all trans and non-binary people have it, but a lot of us do. It's also not a black-and-white thing; people can have dysphoria around some things but not others. Some might only get dysphoria about the name/pronouns used, or only about certain body parts, or some combination. Or they might not experience dysphoria at all.

It's worth it to consider taking your child to see a gender therapist so they can have a safe space to figure things out and receive mental help if they need it.

Given your child's age, it might be helpful to talk to them about if they'd like to use puberty blockers. This isn't the same thing as medically transitioning. It just delays the puberty process so your child would have more time to decide which kind of puberty they'd want to go through. For many trans people, going through the puberty that doesn't match their gender identity can be traumatizing and cause dysphoria due to permanent body changes that aren't gender affirming. Not saying your child is definitely trans or non-binary though. Puberty blockers just help buy extra time so your child can figure out what their identity is and what they want to do. Even if it turns out your child is cisgender, the puberty blockers can be stopped and they'll go through puberty normally without issue.
Hi, I use they/them pronouns and I'm in my thirties. Your child came out to you because they trust you and they want you to see who they are and treat them in ways that feel right for them. Gender variance is a form of creativity and should be celebrated. Being nonbinary or trans is good. 

People use they/them pronouns for lots of reasons. I'm genderqueer and trans, which means I don't see myself or want to be seen as a man or woman, either in the social sense (how people dress or act) or in terms of my body. The trans part for me means that I take hormones which change how I feel and look. Not all trans people take hormones or get surgery.

If you want your child to be happy, use their pronouns and ask them open questions about who they are. You might also ask yourself questions. What do you like about your gender? W

There are some trans people who believe in God, but religion has been used to harm a lot of LGBTQ people. If you are religious, look for LGBTQ accepting religious communities. They do exist.
Hi! First, I just want to thank you for your humility and desire for understanding in doing what's best for your child. It's really nice to hear this, always, because many of us had rough childhoods or bad relationships with our parents. People like yourself make a major difference, and you are important. Please don't listen to any family members or others who are trying to criticize your approach to parenting, or your child's feelings. You're doing the best you can, with your child's best wishes in mind, and that's what counts.

Now, forgive me, but I personally am not very comfortable speaking as an authority on things. I have a thing about not wanting to boss people around, and I'm not sure if I'm a natural teacher. 

At the very basic, though, it sounds like your child is experiencing the feeling of belonging to both genders, male and female. Perhaps they feel they have internal characteristics of both? They might see themselves as both a girl and a boy simultaneously, or somewhere in between. They might see themselves as neither. In my personal experience, as well as that of people I love and trust, all of those criteria could apply to nonbinary folks who use they/them pronouns.

My best advice would be to check out r/askLGBT. It's a really helpful question forum for straight and cisgender people to better understand and support the LGBTQ community, especially people in their families or friend circles. It's populated by a lot of parents and older LGBTQ people who honestly I feel could relate more to you on multiple levels. It's a diverse crowd, too, so you will get a variety of perspectives that will probably make points you had not considered previously. As a nonbinary person myself, I found a lot of useful and helpful information there, as well as just a lot of really kind and intelligent, interesting people.

For what it's worth, I believe that God already supports your child, because if they're a God worth worshipping, they already know you're a good and loving parent. ❤️
I was fairly certain that I wasn't cis at 5 but everytime I tried to talk to my parents about it they told me that I was ""confused, going through a phase, or I'd grow out of it"". I'm 31 now, changed my name, go by they/them pronouns and am looking into surgery.

My mother still thinks I'm confused and will grow out of it
Stop calling them your daughter. You've been getting replies for multiple hours telling you to use gender neutral and you are misgendering your kid in all of your replies. You didn't know when you made the post, you know now. If you want to support non-binary people, including your child, take that advice now. Its really uncomfortable when ""allies"" post here getting so much praise for being supportive while only selectively taking feedback and misgendering the person they talk about. This should be a safe space, so change the language or stop talking here until you can
I use they/them pronouns. For me, a departure of gendered terms makes me feel good. I am afab and don't identify as female nor male, so it make me very uncomfortable to be referred to as she/her or ma'am or miss, etc. When people use gender neutral terms for me, it make me very happy and validates who I am. 

Exposure does not 'confuses' people. It educates. I didn't know what non-binary was most of my life, but I knew I wasn't really okay with being feminine or being female. I just didn't know how to classify myself or express myself until I learned about gender identities and such. Now I'm proud and comfortable with who I am.

Any child has to figure out who they are. Your child is no different. They are just expressing themselves in a way your mom doesn't get because this knowledge most likely wasn't something openly shared when she was a child. That's fine, as long as she doesn't try to suppress who your child wants to be. 

My dad gave me great life advice when I was growing up and it's something I strive to live by: it doesn't matter what you do or who you are, as long as you're happy and not hurting anyone.
You sound absolutely lovely and I want to upvote every comment in this thread. You're already on the right track by proceeding with love, an open mind, and a willingness to learn. 

The only thing I have to add is that gender and sexuality are a spectrum and your child may have many identity shifts in their life. I've identified as bisexual, a lesbian, straight, pan, considered whether or not I'm trans, decided on genderqueer then non-binary when that became a term people used, and now I also identify as asexual but biromantic. 

I'm 38 so even I get confused by all the terms that are available to people these days! When I was your child's age there were like 3. 

The best thing you can do is to listen to them and be a safe space for them to explore and change without pressure or judgement, and to chime in with the others, yes, keep them away from the family members who think of their gender identity as an ""emptiness"". Even though I consider my current gender to be kind of a nothing, what that means to me is that I can be anything. 

Again, you sound great. Good luck!
From my own experience (I was assigned female at birth like your child, and I identify as nonbinary and use they/them pronouns) it isn't a choice. It never was an emptiness that made me feel like I was neither male nor female, it was just how it was.

I hate to break it to you, but those family members are being pretty bigoted and toxic, and those sorts of views/opinions most likely will be damaging for your child. If they're feeling this way about their identity, they need support and they need to be listened to.
Do not let those family members get to you! Don't let them do that shit to your child if they're going to be queerphobic like this!
It's not a choice, first off. And second, for why, because they're nonbinary.
Well i use they/them because i felt sad being thought of as a girl. Being a girl just wasnt me. I still am the same person and so is your child. Im not a girl but im not a boy either. I simply like to exist outside of the expectations of gender.
I would say what others have said, talk with them about it, research it, try to use gender neutral terms, and be patient. It can be difficult (I still misgender myself sometimes because I’m so used to my old pronouns lol) but it’ll get easier over time. 

As far as the whole “if you truly knew God” conversation, I like to remind people that God is referred to in both masculine and feminine roles in scripture, usually being referred to as a mother and a father. To constrict God to the binary of gender to me seems rather insulting and limits God/puts God in a box. I’ve come to terms that God loves me for me and I’m made to be exactly who I am. 

Hope that helps and thanks for being honest about your questions and concerns. You sound like a good mom

Listen. Your relatives pushing religion into the situation need to get a hobby. I was raised x-tian and always, ALWAYS, felt like I was different. It took me til I was in my mid 30's to figure out why because of the conservative xtianity of my very sheltering parents. I was suicidal during most of that time. The pain of knowing you are different without having the means to express that difference or worse, being denied your identity, is not something I'd wish on anyone. 

Let me tell you how I've explained it to people:

You know how you KNOW your gender? You know beyond the shadow of a doubt that how you think of your Self and your biologic sex line up in the way society tells you they should. This is just intrinsic and it's a part of you like breathing. It's the same thing. Your child knows that they are not exactly what society says they should be according to their assigned sex. They know this with every fiber of their being. It's natural and intrinsic and it's a part of them.

It also might change, and it might not. Gender really is a spectrum and even the girliest of girls has a masc day or two, and the manliest of men has a femme day or two. It's natural.

 I personally did a lot of soul searching before coming out as non-binary. My 13yo has said that he's a boy, a non-binary boy, and non-binary using he/they pronouns just this week at different times. He's discovering who he is and how he wants to present himself to the world and that's okay. It's a part of childhood and growing up.

Like you said, your child is still your child and you love them. I'm glad you're taking the time to try to understand where they are coming from. You might do well to ask them if they want to change their clothes or anything about their personal space/bedroom. Just something to help make them more comfortable in the day to day. As long as you are accepting of them and supportive they can probably take on the world. :)
First off, it sounds like you want the best for your kid, and want to do *your* best for them as well. Kudos on being a good person!

Whatever your kid’s gender identity may actually be, that they’re thinking about pronouns other than the ones they’ve used up until now is a pretty solid sign that they’re probably not cisgender. Of course it doesn’t mean it’s absolutely guaranteed that they are; they could be just trying to work out a bunch of things about themselves, working out what fits. Whatever the result of this process winds up being, let them guide you. Let them know that they can talk to you about this stuff. 

If they’re saying that they’re *thinking* about using they/them pronouns rather than saying they *do* want to use they/them, however confident, decisive and sure of themselves they are usually, could be a sign of their nervousness about being accepted rather than uncertainty about themselves. That’s not a judgement on your parenting style either. Coming out, even to someone you’re sure will be supportive and accepting can be scary, and phrasing it this way could be a way of testing the waters. Talk with them about when to use those pronouns. Do they want you to use those pronouns for them all the time, or just in certain situations amongst certain people. They should be the ones to decide if and when they’re ready to announce to people who they are, and how that happens.

It’s okay if you’re confused or uncertain about some or all of this. I’m reliably told that parents don’t actually know everything there is to know, and are sometimes even surprised by things. ;) Seeking out information is always a good thing. Assuming that it turns out your kid is in fact nonbinary, keep in mind that there is no one way to be nonbinary. The pronouns they’re comfortable with may or may not be they/them, and may or may not include other pronouns as well. They may or may not want to change they’re name, at least partially dependant on how gendered their name already is. They may or may not want to change their presentation: clothing, grooming, etc. whatever decisions they make about these elements of themselves now, may or may not stand the test of time. A good way of showing you’re supportive might be to talk with them about the use of other gendered words in relation to them. If they want to use they/them pronouns, they may want to avoid the use of gendered words like “daughter” in reference to themselves. (They may also be okay with it; see above re my “no one way to be nonbinary” comment.)

The absolute best you can do, is listen to what they say about themselves, support and accept those assertions - especially in the face of family members who aren’t as open-minded - and give them every opportunity you can for them to be comfortable and happy with themselves. Good luck to the both of you, and hopefully you’ll be able to come back to us down the track with some positive follow up!
Growing up as a male, I felt a lot of responsibility to present as male however I never felt comfortable with it and I felt confused and lost while I felt this way, and since changing my pronouns a few years back to they/them the responsibility felt like it was lifted, I much preferred to be referred to as a person than what gender I am because at I just don't feel like I belong to either binary genders. I hope this has helped, if you have any other questions then feel free to dm me if be glad to help :)

That site has some good descriptions. 

In regards to your mom, a lot of people have no qualms saying babies are cishet, but freak out of a teen/preteen isn't. Your mom needs to overcome her own bias. 

The Bible explicitly says to love your neighbor emphatically and multiple times,  people that use religion to denigrate others are ignoring an important aspect of the religion. I agree with the other person about not having your child around that relative. Hateful comments will poison any relationship they would have. 

Exploring identity is something to be encouraged, as critical thinking is quite a valuable skill. It may shift some as she ages, but don't think it necessarily will. 

> Can someone please help me to understand why a person makes this choice and what it means.

This is often because there is an incongruence between someone's sense of self and how it is perceived.
First of all, you should ask *them* what it means. We can’t read their mind so we won’t know what gender they specifically are (or even if they’re nonbinary. It’s a fair assumption but I know some binary girls may go by they/them)

If your kid knew God, well that probably wouldn’t change much, seeing as this isn’t some “emptiness” inside them. (Also this rhetoric is disgusting in general. Being devout does not a cure for depression, sadness, or emptiness make and claiming so blames the sufferer for a problem they did not cause. God may help heal but the person does not lose God for lack of devotion. Just an FYI if you are raising your kid religious, I can’t quite tell from this post).

Basically, your kid probably doesn’t think they’re a binary girl. What they are specifically is up to you to ask them. Being a good parent means trying to understand, and you’ve got that down just by asking. Thank you! 

The decision to change pronouns is to align how you are seen with who you are. Often because the pronouns used before are causing pain. But that’s the only choice, to tell people about it. Their being nonbinary/trans is not a choice. 

I recommend checking out PFLAG for more about parenting on this subject. But in general, offer an ear and also do as they asked. You’ve used she/her and “daughter” to talk about them in this post and the comments. Stop the “she,” and ask what terms they like, because daughter is likely not one.

Y’all have added some great resources in the comments!! I also think using their pronouns and trying to be mindful of gendered language, things like calling them your kid instead of your daughter, can go a long way! You’re gonna make mistakes like we all do but try to hold grace for yourself when you do and keep on learning how to do better! This post honestly made my day, thank you for your humility to try to understand, or at least to learn how to be most supportive of your kid. We’re here if you have any more questions along the way!
1.  My family's god/christ-obsessed culture actually caused me to feel empty, flawed, unacceptable, and freakish.  And all this before I even had my own realizations that I was bisexual and non-binary.  I'm born male and have had no surgery or hormone treatment, and the gender roles, stereotypes, and expectations of straight men that they forced onto me when they began to see signs of effeminacy has fucked me up to this day.  I wish I could have come from a science celebrating family that understands that genderqueerness and homosexuality are part of nature.  

2.  Queer people have ALWAYS been here.  They were part of every single human nomadic group existing thousands of years before any Abrahamic death cult or their hateful books.  I knew that I was different when I was a kid.  I knew that I was different still even from other gay and lesbian kids.  I wish I had the language that we do now so that I could have figured myself out in the late 90s.  Social media and the internet are just exposing more of the variety of humans that are out there.  So your family cannot keep people in ignorance
Go along! Don’t let the family members around them without supervision, and do NOT stand by and say nothing if they try to tell your kid “you’re confused”. Respect their pronoun and name preferences, think of it how some people like to be addressed as a nickname and others HATE being called anything besides their full first name, it’s up to them what makes them comfortable, and it’s up to you to help them feel comfortable. Don’t be afraid to have conversations about this stuff, be genuine in wanting to learn when you ask them questions, and take in as much info as you can. 

If you’d like some recommendations for books that would help understand the situation better, feel free to DM! 

This was likely hard for ur kid, and you should be proud of them for being brave and telling you. Be there for them, and be proud of yourself for wanting to learn and help.
I don't know if it helps, but I'm probably older than you are. It took me a long time to understand a lot of things about myself, including that I'm nonbinary. What I can tell you is that my life is not better because I spent so long identifying as a woman. I detested everything about what people say it means to be a woman, and I was really angry and frustrated. Having an angry, stressed, confused kid wasn't fun for my parents, and being that way wasn't fun for me. Your child will undoubted appreciate your support while figuring things out. Pushing God or taking away social media won't solve the problem, but it will probably push your child away.
Those who posted before me have said a lot of great things and I hope I won't repeat too much. I'm 47 and didn't figure out I was nonbinary until I was around 30. My life would have been SO much richer if I had the understanding of myself and the world that your kid is demonstrating! As to what leads people to request different pronouns, there isn't a universal answer. For many of us, it's that the binary options (he/him and she/her) don't match who we are. For me, it's just how I am on a fundamental level. It doesn't come from an 'emptiness' inside or other lack. If anything, it comes from truly understanding that I don't follow the default. Someone in my support group pointed out that the work that gender diverse people do to learn who we are is an invaluable strength!

One thing I don't think I've seen in the other replies is a way to handle the argument that your kid is too young to know that this change is right. It may be that your child will evolve in terms of their understanding of their gender, and that's 100% fine! I don't know anyone who had their whole identity as a person figured out at 12 other than those who never matured past that point. 

Trusting and respecting your kid enough to use their requested language does no harm to anyone who matters and will build am even stronger relationship with your child. If they eventually decide that another set of pronouns works better or that some another form of expression will make them happy, then great! This is a journey for all of us. If you look around this sub, you'll find some older enbys out there living their best lives, and some didn't find their place until later in life.

Just like any other aspect of learning who they are, supporting your kid around their gender will pay off in the long run. I hope you can take the responses you've seen here as support in standing up to those family members who don't/won't understand. Hopefully, they'll come around, but that's not your responsibility. They're grown, so it's on them to decide if they actually care for the kid you have or if they only care about who they expected this young person to be.

You got this! Good luck!
Thank you for supporting your kid in this way, my own parents cut off contact after I told them the same thing.  They sound like a really smart kid and I'm sure they appreciate your support and validation immensely! Just practice pronouns and maybe get them a nonbinary flag as a gift!
Try having someone misgender you, and it just feels wrong. That's how we feel when we hear the wrong pronouns. Speaking from a 32y trans NB, I wish I would have been able to go deeper into those feelings when I was younger
I came out as bi at 17 to my mom. She told me I was confused. She told me I didn't know what I was talking about. It broke me. I don't think I was ever the same after that. I spent a couple of decades in deep, deep shame and am only now digging myself out. 

Take the advice here. Do the opposite of what she did. I believe in you, from one parent to another. Give your child the gift of believing them. <3 I believe in you.
You’ve gotten so many great responses so I just wanted to touch on one thing that I wish my mom was better about. She still struggles a lot with my name and pronouns and I know exactly why. It’s because, despite a lot of soul-searching and attempting to let go on her part, she still sees me as a girl.

I know this is a hard thing to change in your brain when you’ve known someone their whole life, and especially when the idea of being non-binary is something really new. But I think being conscious of it is the best first step. It’s something I had to figure out when I first had a friend come out as trans. I managed not to mess up his pronouns out loud, but in my head, I still slipped up. But then I realized it was because I didn’t see him as a guy yet. As soon as I realized that, I thought, “that’s dumb, he is a guy” and that was that. It seems really obvious, but just consciously reminding your brain “hey! They’re non-binary, not a [insert agab here]!” is, in my opinion, the best way to get better about names, pronouns, and gendered language in general.

I hope this is helpful! And thank you for being an awesome parent and reaching out to your kid’s community for help. You’re doing an amazing job already and your kid is lucky to have you as their parent!✌🏻
70's liberated heterosexuals from the expectation of raising a family
Lockdown gave individuals the privacy, and time to collectively share another revolution, that liberates all from performing one of two genders
It was a matter of time, what an unnecessary burden, to be told you are not woman enough, not man enough; what an obvious solution, hidden behind taboo, that we should represent ourselves exactly how we feel on the inside, and support others, so that we may all be supported
Why are you still interacting with these toxic family members is the question... I would ask your child what using they/them pronouns means to them. Are they trans/non-binary? Just gender non-conforming? Do they need help accessing things like a binder or other things to express their gender? Would counseling be helpful, are they interested in physically transitioning?
First of all, it’s not a choice. Our gender and sexuality is how we feel as a person, and we can’t choice who we like or how we feel from the inside.

Also, social media doesn’t impact how we feel as a person. It’s how we act and how we feel, just like I said.

And we can’t stop feeling this. It’s who we are as a person, and it’s not some excuse to feel happy or something. It can make us feel happy, but it’s not by choice.

I’m non-binary, but I don’t choose to feel neutral. It’s how I act and feel as a person.
Absolutely!!
So my mom still doesn’t understand me and my gender, I’ve actually never told her I’m non-binary, and I’m 28. So first off congrats on being there for your child. Try your best to be open and free from judgment.

Some things my mom did that were not positive while growing up were not letting me dress how I wanted, because she was so worried about what people would think of her. Make sure you’re encouraging your child to be authentic and true to whatever they are feeling. They can always tell when you’re worried about what grandma will think, or if you’re asking them to change how they dress because gramma or aunty is coming over to visit. 

I obviously don’t know if your child feels the same way, but when my mom would want family photos and she would buy me dresses, I was always so uncomfortable. I never enjoyed being dressed as a girl, even as an adult I have weeks or months where I cannot wear dresses. Let you child explore, try not to put up boundaries, in the end gender roles are social constructs and they change when people stop following them. 

This is not a disease, your child is not empty, they are simply exploring a part of themselves that most adults don’t even tap into. I wish you both the best!
As a non-binary person whose parents struggled with this exact thing, I’d suggest reading up on gender and the trans experience- I’ll link a really good webpage with lots of different resources here: https://www.lgbtmap.org/policy-and-issue-analysis/advancing-acceptance-for-parents 
Thank you for being a parent who wants to support your child 🖤
It isn’t a choice. They chose to confide in you. My best advice is to listen to your child. Their are a lot of good resources and videos of non binary people talking about their experience with gender. Non binary people have existed before social media. It’s just that this is a new term. A large amount of civilizations had more than two gender classification. Ancient Egypt had three iirc. Gender is social performance if you think about it. Even being a cis man or cos woman, everyone is following societal rules of the game. That’s why the standard for beauty and attractiveness chance throughout history. It’s all made up as we go. All of it. Some people don’t fit in the narrow binary idea of gender. Your child  is one of those people. Give them time to get to know themselves and just be there for them.  It’s not a race for either of you.
&#x200B;

You're amazing for wanting to support your kid. And your kid is amazing for having the courage to speak out for their truth.

This is a journey...for you both.

Coming out is just one step, you'll take a lot more together and it'll be probably the most rewarding thing you do as a family. Don't be afraid to reach out for support from others. There are many queer friendly therapy groups and therapists now. It's helpful to go, even just to develop a comfortableness around discussing the topic, your emotions, and the external judgments that will come your way.

I'd say the best thing for a parent is to be vocal about how much you love your kid, and create boundaries around supporting them so others cannot cause damage. There will be some struggle, life is an ongoing struggle for many things, but what makes a family is your ability to  love and listen in the face of confusion. Like I said, this is a journey and nothing is written in stone. A non-binary person may fluctuate in the way they act or dress or express their gender. We just need space and time to explore what that means to us.

You mentioned in some comments you struggle with self-esteem. I did too. Speaking your mind and standing up for something/someone you believe in is one way to develop that. When the voices of others nag at you in the back of your mind, tell those thoughts to fuck right hell off because your kid is amazing and beautiful.

Then go out and do stuff together. Have fun. Live you lives to the fullest. You're both worth it.

As a lot of other comments have mentioned, being non-binary is different for everyone. Here's *my* reasoning for being non-binary just to give another perspective:

1. The words ""man"" and ""male"" have a lot of weight and meaning to them in our society
2. Many of those meanings don't align with how I live my life and see myself
3. The words ""woman"" and ""female"" have a lot of weight and meaning to them in our society
4. Many of those meanings don't align with how I live my life and see myself

When you put all that together, non-binary is a great fit. It allows me to be *me* without having to worry about not being ""right"" by some rules that society gave about what was ""manly"" or ""feminine"".

Personally, I also think those four points are a good starting point for understanding the idea of non-binary more objectively. Just about everyone has *some* trait about themselves that doesn't match cleanly with their gender identity. I know men that do most of the cooking and cleaning in the house, and I know women that can fix cars better than my own father. Just because those traits are traditionally not related to their given gender doesn't make that gender less right for *them*.

Another thing to keep in mind that this isn't a ""new thing"". People have existed who would have been better described by non-cis gender identities forever, we're just putting new words to it. Taking the emotions out of it and remembering that these are just more specific words people use to describe and express themselves can help with understanding better sometimes.

From the sounds of it, be prepared to enforce boundaries with other family members. Even if you don't fully understand what your child is going through at the moment, they need to know you'll be there for them. I'd suggest talking with your child about what boundaries they'd like to set so you're prepared to enforce them and don't have to worry about family members crossing a line that they can't *un*cross.

All in all, I think you should focus on the fact that your child felt comfortable coming to you with this. It means they trust you, and that is a *wonderful* place to start from.
There are many great comments but I would like to put in my input as a teenager who does not have the support of their mother. 

(At the bottom I will have a simple guide to “transness”)

First of all, coming directly to this community for support and questions was the best thing you can do. Do not listen to anybody that is not trans or doesn’t regularly work with trans people. You wouldn’t go to a dermatologist if you had a kidney problem. All those comments you mention (and ones you’ll get in the future) come from ignorance and lack of education regarding the trans community. Most things people hear about the trans community is propaganda to incite fear (ex. trans people are predators and pedophiles). 

First and foremost, the biggest way to support your child is to be educated, listen to their needs, and be supportive. One of the biggest ways you can do that is using their preferred pronouns (and preferred name if they decide to change it). It feels awful to be misgendered intentionally. And know now you will mess up. You will accidentally call them the wrong thing. You will not be perfect immediately, and that is absolutely okay. It takes a minute to retrain yourself to use different pronouns. Even as a trans person myself I mess up with peoples pronouns as they are coming out. All you do is correct yourself and move on. Don’t stop what you’re saying, don’t make a big deal out of it. Just switch the pronoun and keep going. I’ll give an example of what to do and what not to do. Using myself as the example.

Ex: “Leo said she- he wants to get food.” (Correct way) You may want to apologize but don’t do it in the middle of conversation, it draws attention to it, and nobody wants that. If you really want to apologize just pull the person the side later and acknowledge that you slipped up but you promise that you’re trying.

Ex: “Leo said she- oh my god I’m so sorry, idk why I did that. I feel so bad oh my god I didn’t mean it.” (Wrong way) do not ever do this. One, you’re drawing attention to the slip up and making it awkward for everyone. Two, you reinforce in your brain that this is bad. And you’ll psych yourself out of learning to use these pronouns. People do this to me all the time and it’s very frustrating. A lot of people just use my name instead of using my pronouns because it is “too hard”. It is never too hard to have basic decency to someone. 

(One easy way to get used to using pronouns is over text. You can easily go back and fix mistakes. Plus you’ll get used to regularly using those pronouns for your child)

Just remember it is not about you. It’s about your child and their happiness. It’s not too hard for you or too much for you. You have the privilege of being a cisgender (someone who identifies as their assigned gender at birth) person. You don’t have to deal with dysphoria, transphobia, violence, and if you’re in the U.S., watching your rights being stripped away from you. It’s not hard for you to switch pronouns. It is hard for your child navigating the world as a trans person. 

As for your child being “too young” to know, just ignore that. Even if they are just questioning, why make them miserable for the time being? So many people are worried about hrt (hormone replacement therapy) or gender affirming surgery. But depending on your child’s level of dysphoria (and the laws regarding trans people where you live) it may not be necessary. And there are many steps to take before you can even access that type of care. And there are steps to take before you even consider that. First, if they are comfortable with it, assess your child’s level of dysphoria. For context dysphoria is like a feeling of unease or wrongness because your body doesn’t match your gender identity. It can be a very weak feeling. My weak dysphoria would be “oh this shirt makes me look feminine so I won’t wear it”. Medium “I’m anxious about going out because I’m afraid I’ll be misgendered”. High “My body is wrong and I want to hurt myself”. If your child has no dysphoria that’s wonderful continue their social transition of using different pronouns and/or name. If they have mild dysphoria try using different clothing, makeup, new hair, etc. to make them feel more comfortable. You could possibly try binding, but it can be very unsafe and damaging if not done properly. If your child considers doing that then please properly research good binders. Wear it correctly and don’t wear it longer than needed. Some people bind for days and days, sometimes weeks, and that point is when something like top surgery is needed. You shouldn’t physically hurt yourself to feel better mentally. I’m aware that treatment is a luxury a lot of people don’t have, but that is never an excuse to harm yourself. So if your child ever binds please monitor them. If your child’s dysphoria is so high that they desperately need hrt or surgery find them a trans friendly therapist. Someone who knows what they are doing, and you can work out together how to proceed from there. Honestly I’d suggest getting a therapist regardless of who you are, but that’s a luxury that some people don’t have. 

Anyway to wrap this portion up. You did a great job by reaching out to this community and admitting that you’re worried and don’t know how to handle this. A lot of people have too much pride to do that and end up hurting their child. The best way to handle this is to listen to your child. They know what’s best for them. If they want extreme things, like maybe bottom surgery, that’s when you as a parent step in. (I would not suggest bottom surgery to a minor who is possibly still going through puberty. If that is ever an issue things like packers or stps are an option). Communicate fully with your child. You’ve got this.

Also, please ask us for anything you need. I’m always willing to help and I’m sure many other people here are too.
Hi OP. I'm a transitioning nonbinary adult who does a lot of volunteer work with trans and gender creative youth as well as their parents. If you would like to DM me with any questions you have, I can also see if I know of any resources in your area. Local support groups exist and are fantastic places to start. You will feel a million times better meeting other parents with kids like yours (and they will make some friends too!)

You've gotten some great advice in this thread already but again if you want to talk about anything in private please feel free to DM me. This stuff is my lifes work so to speak and I am an open book for questions <3
I would recommend looking up a group for parents of LGBTQ+ children. It’s important to learn the statistics, language and culture in order to make your child feel free to be themselves

Edit: thank you for wanting to learn and grow and understand
I really found this zine so helpful and comforting as I was coming out to MYSELF as nonbinary, but it’s actually written for caring parents and family such as yourself! https://www.craftordiy.art/nonbinaryzine

Your kid sounds like a great kid, and you and your husband sound like great parents that your kid feels comfortable to come to both of you about these things! Some people “know” they are trans/nonbinary/queer in some way from when they’re little, some discover it later, some people change throughout their lives. That’s true since before social media, and regardless of religious affiliation.

The best way to help your child be happy: listen to them, and support them in the ways they ask, or in some cases “wonder about” if they are too afraid to be firm (something I do too, as an adult!) 

And consider… even if this is a “phase” (which gets a bad rap, but we ALL have different phases in our lives!) what’s the worst that could come of using they/them for your kid, getting comfortable with gender neutral language, and standing up for your kid if anyone has a problem? Your kid will know you have their back and take them seriously, and that’s not too bad, is it? :)
Take a deep breath, and remind yourself you're doing a good job at parenting. I know all this information can be very overwhelming and you're worried about making a mistake, but the fact that your child feels comfortable at all to share this part of themself with you, means they feel safe enough to do so. That's something which, sadly, is in very short supply for many queer kids. So you already have put the right foot forward before even starting this journey with your child. 

Being non-binary can be extremely confusing for someone who's never experienced their gender feeling ""wrong."" Heck, it's still confusing even for people who are non-binary! It's completely okay of you don't really understand everything right now. Loving and respecting your child, while being open and listening to them, is the most important thing.

As a way to explain it though, this is a very simple metaphor I've used to talk about my experience: 

>I was given size 6 shoes to wear. They never fit right. I tried and tried to walk around wearing them, but they always hurt my feet. Yet every shoe store I went to only had size 6 or size 10. Everybody else I knew could fit into those sizes. Some were even given the wrong size, like me, but switched to other and then they were finally comfortable in their shoes. Not me though. I tried the size 6's and the size 10's; they either were too tight or slipped right off. I struggled for years walking in the wrong shoes. Until finally, one day, I found a different shoe store. And for the very first time, I got a pair of shoes that fit me perfectly. It turns out I was a size 8 all along. 

>I know I am non-binary in the very same way I know when the wrong shoes do not fit me.

And I did know. Many trans folks (non-binary falls under the transgender umbrella) have these feelings for years before they find the language to express their identity. I remember being in kindergarten and a) having crushes on girls and b) not wanting to be a girl myself. 

But it wasn't until being in my 20's that I understood what non-binary genders were. Learning about non-binary folks made a lightswitch flip in my brain. I can't forget the day it happened. I was watching a youtube video of non-binary people talking about their gender (cause I wanted to be supportive to my queer friends) and I had to pause like two minutes in and just sit back going ""oh fuck, that's me."" Like a revelation. Suddenly everything in my entire life of feeling like being a girl didn't ""fit"" made sense. Suddenly *I* made sense to me. 

Not to ramble on about my own life story, but I mention this cause it sounds like there's relatives who are saying some very harmful things about your child. There's no such thing as having one's gender (or sexuality) influenced by friends or school or social media or tv or whatever it is that people pick to blame. Yes, I came out as non-binary after watching youtube videos about non-binary folks. This is true. But it didn't *make me* trans. It didn't *influence me* into slapping a ""trendy"" new label on myself. All it did was give me the words to actually talk about who I am. I've always been non-binary. It's certainly not a choice. The only confusion about my gender which I've ever had was always being told I was a girl, despite never feeling like one. I did feel empty then. Only after living as my actual gender for the past few years, have I learned just how deeply unhappy I was before. I *like* me now. I'm not disgusted by my body anymore. The feeling of being ""wrong"" is gone.

This is just my experience, of course. Not everybody is gonna have that ""Ah ha!"" moment and it can take years and years to figure out one's gender identity. Your child may tell you they have different pronouns and such as they keep figuring themself out. That's perfectly normal. And, if that does happen, use the new pronouns and just keep on going forward. No one knows your child better than themself. From how you've talked about them, they seem to be a pretty good advocate for themself too, and it's wonderful that you've raised them with such confidence.

Another important conversation to have is to ask them how *you* can be the best possible advocate for them. Unfortunately, as you've already experienced, people will be queerphobic, intolerant, closed-minded, and otherwise just disrespectful to your child. It is the shitty world we live in. But, they got you! And that's fantastic.

Ask them what boundaries they need. That one God preaching family member of yours should be kept away from your child entirely. I don't know the situation with your mother, however, don't let her talk to your kid without you there. A young queer person being told they're faking it and just confused is very damaging to their sense of self and their own agency as a person

Ask them if there's others who make them uncomfortable. Family members might not say things to you directly, but they'll say things to you child. Ask them about school. The students and the teachers. School can either be sometimes pretty supportive or absolute hell. Probably more toward the forner, hopefully, since you said they have queer friends. Do they need accommodations at school? Bathrooms are a whole issue, plus if there's anything gender segregated, like uniforms. Changing name, pronouns, the whole shebang will be something you have to make happen for them. And ask them about being in public in general. If someone misgenders them, do they want you to step in and correct it every time? With friends and family, definitely, but strangers? Your impulse might be to of course fix that for them (and that's a good impulse!), but they might also simply not want to deal with it. Sometimes it's easier to hide than risk a potentially hateful reaction. 

Something that my wife and have is a code word for when we need to the other person to step in, or get out of a situation. Obviously, it's a bit different for a parent and child, though having a word your kid can say whenever something's happening which is making them feel uncomfortable (without needing to go into a whole explanation) could be really beneficial. Things like dysphoria and experiencing queerphobia can be very hard to talk about, even to ourselves. Much less while they're still in the stressful situation. 

Ah, sorry this got so long. Again, no rush. You'll get there, and you're doing great already. Coming to talk to non-binary folks in the first place is just, like, wow. 

It's obvious you respect your kid and are focused on what's best for them. From me, a non-binary person who had to go no contact with my mother years ago, thank you for supporting your child. You have no idea how much it means to a kid for their parent to accept who they are is real. I hope for the absolute best for you and your kiddo. Best of luck to you both! 💜
Okay, so you mentioned in comments they're 12 and I wanted to offer a few suggestions 

#1 - realize they're young! It's possible as they explore their identity they'll end up with different pronouns later, possibly going back to she/her, maybe he/him, possibly adding or taking away some along the way. It's a journey of exploration and finding themselves and this could take time. Other people are sure of it right away, regardless, don't let others tell them it was ""just a phase"" - their a kid, phases are how they find what sticks. It's completely normal to go through phases and I think it's important to recognize that. But recognize it by treating it like it's not a phase, not by brushing it aside. (I also don't think it's a phase, to clarify, but I also don't want to suggest it's not also a journey of growth exploring gender) ""Getting confused"" while exploring identity is sort of a red flag phase, if you're exploring your identity, you're likely to get confused. But the only way to know if  things are going to work is to try them.

#2 ask them if there's any other changes they'd like to make. A shortened name? A nickname? Would they like a haircut or anything similar? Are they okay being daughter or would they like to be child? Are they comfortable using gendered restrooms at school or would they like you you reach out to the school?  Different people have different preferences. 

#3 If you can afford it, I'd consider therapy. Not with a therapist to talk them out of their identity, but with one who they can talk too that can help support them in their gender/queer discovery journey. Talk with the therapist first and make it clear you want to support them as much as possible. 

#4 Get yourself a therapist (again, if affordable/feel like it's needed) just to check in and see how you're doing. Transitioning can be hard to wrap your head around, and dealing with unsupportive family/friends can be difficult. If you're not solid on boundary setting, it can help to get some professional support. 

#5 They made the choice because to them its who they are. They're young, but the fact they've trusted you with both their identities at such a young age speaks volumes (good ones)  about you as a parent. They trust you, hold onto that trust and believe them when they tell you who they are. Taking the step to reach out here is also amazing, having to explain your identity to people when you may be still figuring it out can be difficult. So the fact you're doing the research yourself is really good. That being said, I would in the future when asking about stuff (or talking in general about them)  use their pronouns! It's a good way to practice and make sure you're getting them right. It can also help to practice in front of a mirror, saying stuff like:

Mabel is my child, they're on the swim team! I'm really proud of tjem because they got second place in a meet last week. 
John is my child, they do art and they just showed me a really cool painting of theirs. 
Forest is my child, despite being named Forest they're really good at computer science. 

Stuff like that on your own can be helpful in learning and practicing.

#6 Ask them if they're comfortable with you sharing stuff publicly. I know younger friends transitioning who want their parents to document it on social media so they can look back on it. But others would rather avoid mention of it and just treat it as if nothing happened. Again, talk  with them about their preferences for how they want to move through the world. That kinda gets to the point of your original question - what does it mean? Only they know. 

#7 In terms of if you're worried about reactions from people, people are going to be hateful but people are always going to find something to hate. You can be successful and nonbinary. (I have a coworker at a nonprofit who's a department head in the Bible belt but openly uses neo-pronouns!)  You can be married or have kids (if that's your vibe) and be non-binary. Heck, we have non-binary politicians and therapists. (I imagine also lawyers and surgeons I just haven't heard of any) While it can often feel like being trans or nonbinary is a scary existence, it's also a loving one with an amazing community. I'm writing this cuddled up with my girlfriend right now and our cat is knocking over my water bottle. I met all my friends in college through queer affirming groups (including campus ministry!) 

#8 Just in regards to the campus ministry thing, if you are religious, take a critical look at how your religion handles queer people. Are they affirmed? Not just welcomed/accepted, most religions welcome/accept anyone. (At least the ones I've interacted with) But affirming means queer people are allowed to lead, they're allowed to educate, they can hold opinions and those opinions are valued. Those places exist, look for them if they're important to you or your child.


Eta: I have no idea why certain paragraphs are bigger in text size. I'm on mobile
Heya:) I can see that this post is genuone and coming from a good place so I'm really glad that you've been doing that. 
Each non-binary person's experience is very different so although it's good that you're reaching out to other people in the community, the key to understand where your child is coming from is to have a conversation with them about it.
Also, you briefly mentioned a family member bringing in God into the matter and I just wanted to say that there is nothing contradictory about the faith and atypical gender expressions. So if you are a Christian/religious household, please dont feel the need to choose a side. If the crux of God is love then that is all the support should be focused on:))
I wish for the best for your child and hope that everything goes well
non binary people are just people, i can see from every point there, those people are trying to demonize the idea of being non binary but if you really sit and think about it, what is the harm? at the very worst, they could be wrong, but if that's true all you have to do is make sure your clear about loving them no matter how they identify so if one day they decide they were wrong they can feel comfortable telling you, outside of that, there's really no harm in calling them ""they/them"" is there, also i would say, with an extended family like that, they probably need your love and support more than most.
Mom to a nb teenager & a not legally adoptive mom to a genderqueer teen over here. Just wanted to say thank you for not just shutting it down and instead coming to the internet to do some research. I have watched my “adopted” kiddo be told that they don’t know what they want, that my kiddo is just badly influencing them, that it’s not appropriate, it’s “against god”, be told that they are supported but won’t be called by their name or pronouns, limited on what kind of clothing they can buy, how they can cut their hair, etc., and I have watched these actions absolutely crush this beautiful human’s soul. Just… thank you for trying. 
You already have a lot of solid answers here so I’m not going to double up much but I would like to emphasize the advice to be wary of allowing those kinds of family members access to your child. It can be incredibly damaging to hear that kind of stuff from the people who are supposed to love you. My mom and I have had to cut a family member out of our existence because he couldn’t keep his opinions to himself, caused a full blown panic attack for my kid. I legit packed everyone up and left in the middle of a visit multiple states away and my mom ended up moving out, It’s made it harder to see the family we love but, I told my baby I couldn’t control how everyone reacts/supports them, but I could control if it was my family/friends and I’d go scorched earth for them no matter who was the culprit and I got to back those words up a lot sooner than I thought I would lol. 
IDK if it’s already too late, seems like it might be since you’re catching flak from family, but it might be helpful to talk to other people about this and not your family unless your child has expressly okay’d you outing them. We have family members that my child is uncomfortable being out to, and ones they’re okay with and we keep things very separate until they change their mind. At the end of the day this can greatly change the makeup of your kid’s circle and they deserve control over when that happens. 
Lastly, all “my” queer kiddos came out to me around 9-12 years of age. And yeah, maybe it is the internet’s fault, not for *influencing* them, but supplying them with the appropriate vocabulary to better define themselves. I’m thirty something and when I was a kid, the words were gay, bi, or trans, and that was about it, right? But none of those things were exactly… me? Now there is this abundance of people sharing their experiences and understanding and it can make things a lot easier to process on a different timeline than other generations. That’s my take on it anyway.
They are still who they are they are just more. It’s important that they know how much you support them. Keep the other family members away if they’re unable to treat your child with the care and love that they should. 
Like everything, enby is like a spectrum. For me personally I feel like gender norms shouldn’t define me as a person and I go by any pronouns because I just don’t really care that much. For your child it could be completely different as well. 

My best advice to you is to just listen to them and believe them when they say they feel a certain way about their self. 

I hope I didn’t come off prissy or anything, I apologize if I have. 
Have a great weekend!
hi, I'm also a mum of a nb young person. they've chosen they/them pronouns for now, although they are happiest when they're feminine. one of our favourite things was going shopping and allowing them to choose their own clothes/jewellery ect and develop there own style/persona. 

the main thing I've learnt is to follow their lead. also been surprised by who has been supportive and who was dismissive. 

sorry I haven't had a chance to read all the  comments yet (I will as there looks to be some great resources in there)

ps. they're 10m
Since everyone else has the big stuff covered: do little things to celebrate your child's identity. Maybe buy them a pronoun pin or hang a non binary flag in the house. Today at work a kid came running up to me as soon as they were dropped off to show me the necklace their mom got them, which had the non binary colors in beads. Little things like that mean so much because it shows that you don't just accept them, you are proud of them and want to celebrate them.
Hi! First of all, you are already doing a great job, and it's so amazing that you seek out information and help from the community! You are willing to listen and learn, and I can't stress enough how important that is.
I wanna touch on ""they're just confused"" rethoric a little. So, its transphobia, plain and simple. But i think its important to recognize where it's coming from. Many ppl are afraid that kids are pressured into and/or will go through all the trouble of being trans just to recognize it's not for them later, when they think is ""already too late"". But here's the thing. If one's experiences change over time, that does not make them invalid. If you feel anger in one moment, and happiness I the next, that doesn't mean your anger was invalid. If you liked dogs as s child, but then grew up and started liking cats more, that doesn't mean your love for dogs was somehow inadequate. We are all just a bunch of experiences in the specific moment in time. And yes, those experiences can change. But that doesn't mean anyone should regret them. My sister explored her gender for a bit and then came to a conclusion she isn't trans, and there's nothing wrong with that. And I'm pretty sure I'm nonbinary trans, because that's a consistent experience for me throughout the years, and there's nothing wrong with that either. So, yeah. It's just something important for you and your child to recognize, so that those comments won't get under the skin of both of you.
And the one about the God is just bullshit. God didn't helped or thousands of other trans ppl. If I continued to follow religion, I would still hate myself and be miserable. That, ofc, depends on how you view religion, but where I'm from the rules are too rigid to allow me to be myself and be a believer at the same time. On the other hand, there are a lot of trans people who do believe in God, and it's not like they believe in him less than others. Belief doesn't magically make you conform to your assigned gender at birth or make you strsight, that simply doesn't work the way some ppl seem to think it does.

Anyways,  that's all I wanted I say, hopefully that helps you deal with those relatives. You're doing great, I think your child is very lucky to have you!

P.s. if you wanna hear abt my ecoeriences of being nonbinary and/or how I came to this realization, lemme know! I'm just not sure if I should write it due to the abundance of comments x)
""I love my child no matter what because that's what being a parent means.""

""I just want my daughter to be happy.""

Solid parenting right there. 👍  As long as you keep thinking like that, pretty sure your kid will turn out alright.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It reminds me of a newspaper clipping I saw awhile ago. Some parents had taken out a notice in the ""birth"" section in the newspaper, making a correction to their original notice, saying that they didn't have a daughter anymore. Thinking the worst, I read on...

Turns out their daughter had come out as trans to them, and wanted ""he/him"" to be used.

So the parents were writing in, saying the original birth notice was mistaken, and that they now have a son. ❤

It ended with a note to their new son: ""Loving you is the easiest thing in the world. Now tidy your room."" 😋
So I haven’t noticed this said yet: please don’t ever refer to being nonbinary as a choice.

The only choice involved with a person’s sexuality and gender identity is wether they tell you what it is. Its less about harm directly to your child, and more about reinforcing negative thought processes of other people. Thinking people choose their non-cis gender identity leads to the connotation that it is abnormal and divergent from the “regular” genders, and that eventually slides into what conversion therapy people believe.

I highly recommend looking for some historical references of gender throughout history (the book titles escape me right now but they are certainly out there). Non-cis genders have existed as long as humanity has and learning a little about it will also help your child learn of the normality of gender spectrum and be better informed.

Best of luck in the parenting adventure!
You clearly have an amazing relationship with your child if they felt they could come to you with this! I love this so much. I recommend following people online who have non binary children and support them and watch them and practice using their new pronouns when and where you can!
There is no emptiness. It isn't a choice. It has nothing to do with god.  Those 'connections' like comparing an apple to a blackhole, they have nothing in common. Your child is really just showing they are comfortable with you and trying to figure out how to be comfortable with themselves.  When I asked my mom ""how come you accepted me being non-binary so easily."" she said ""Why would I not? That is just another part of who you are and I am not much of a mother if I don't accept my children for being humans themselves.""
Well on the subject of what causes someone to identify as non-binary, it's that we don't feel like, or want to play the part, of either ""traditional"" gender. 

Nature doesn't do things in a binary mode, bimodal sure, but a binary ""either/or"" view of gender is just the categorization that most people layer over the reality of it. (If you're unfamiliar with distribution curves, bimodal distribution is two bell curves stuck together.) So most people don't experience a lot of dissonance living within the traditional binary, that's where the most people are in relation to gender. But those peaks have tails, or areas that are a measure outside what you'd call gender conforming, and that's where non-binary people experience and express gender.

I know very few people come here for statistics presentations, but I hope this gives you a different way to think about things. 

Arguing the extended family into accepting and embracing is going to be quite difficult. This is more of a feelings disagreement than a facts argument. It might be a better tac to find out why they feel like letting kiddo be themselves, or hell just explore, is dangerous? It might come from fear that they'll be treated lesser than a binary gender conforming person, if so you could impress on them that it's even more important that you encourage and support them.
That is very, very helpful advice! Especially from a parent perspective! Thank you for your insight and wisdom. I welcome it with open arms❤️🤗  I wish you luck on your journey in parenthood and healing from your past
I don't have a kid, but I do have a mother and I think I can give some insight and advice. 

First, its not a ""choice"". It's simply who your child is. Not a boy, not a girl, your child. They were born this way and it just took time for them to realize it. I'm 24 and realized when I was 23, your child is ahead of me in that regard. 

Your mother and this other family member are wrong. Your child does not have any ""emptiness"" inside them. In fact, suppressing their identity would cause an emptiness because they wouldn't ever feel like who they really are. 

Finally, begin using the same words I have been this whole time. For example, ""this is my child, they're fantastic and I love them."" They may be fine with being called ""daughter"" but I'd recommend making sure. Using the pronouns they request is SUPER important, don't exclusively use them around your child, use them everywhere and with everyone when referring to your child. My own mother doesn't do this well and it makes me feel unloved. If you truly do love your child, use their pronouns as requested. 

I hope this was helpful.
>Then I have this other family member telling me if she truly knew God she wouldn’t have this emptiness inside her and feel like this.

Start putting up some boundaries between this person and your child - that sentiment will absolutely harm someone who is in the process of exploring their identity and inner self.

I was raised Christian and did everything ""right"" (not claiming perfection) I followed the formula prescribed to me to a T. When I ""fell short"" I ""repented"" and my heart wanted nothing more than to please God and be his kingdom's representative here on earth...

...problem is, I was *repressing* myself the whole time because who I am didn't fit their mold. I was left with terrible anxiety and no self esteem at all (in spite of knowing God and not doubting his love for me).

I only started deconstructing away from the faith a couple years ago and finally felt free enough to be myself as I approach 40yrs. So much of my life wasted, pretending and surviving rather than living and thriving.

.

>Can someone please help me to understand why a person makes this choice and what it means.

It's less of 'making a choice' and more of 'realizing that society's assumptions of gender are out of sync with your internal experience' and then owning it and living that truth honestly.

As I previously mentioned, I only **just** started exploring this stuff and living truthfully within the last year and I've never been happier with life and with who I am.

Unfortunately even being almost 40, I'm terrified to bring this up to my parents because I don't trust them to see me. You seem like good people and you're taking the right first steps ✨
Thank you for asking about this. I was afraid to for fear of offending someone. My teen is dating someone who is non binary and they have a ton of friends that identify the same. He tried to explain it but did so poorly. So I lurk and learn. Eventually I threw them a big party and 30-40 kids showed up and it was wonderful. My generation wants to put everything in a labeled box, and I am deconstructing that notion and just accepting what others choose for themselves. Everyone deserves the right to be happy and safe.
Uhh, what makes you want to use the pronouns you prefer? It just feels right, it fits. Your child may be feeling that being a girl isn't the right fit for them. It's important to be supportive of your child right now so they can develop into who they want to be, and not be suppressed by overbearing family members who want to force them into conformity. That just makes everyone involved miserable. By the way, they/them pronouns work for anyone of any gender. When you watch a car run a red light, what do you say about the driver? 'they were probably on their phone' or something like that. It works for everyone regardless of gender. However many people like to use more specific pronouns to reflect their gender identity, such as she/her, fae/faer, he/him, etc. I don't see how using or not using specific ones is any more or less valid, nor do I see how only certain specific ones are valid. That's just rigid traditions refusing to include everyone.

It all depends on how you look at things. If you try to look at this from your child's point of view, it will make sense, they're expressing how they feel inside, and that feeling may not be feeling like a girl, as you may have previously expected of them. Just work with them and make sure you two are able to communicate openly. If you try to impose the judgement of the particular society you grew up in on the situation, where there may be restrictive, rigid gender roles and expectations, a lot of people just don't fit into that structure and are treated like freaks and feel perpetually misunderstood.
I didn't see anyone link any professional sources. Here are some, a drop in the bucket to what is out there. Don't have kids myself, just the experience of being one. My parents overall were really great, the things that made being a kid difficult was when they didn't see me for me. Looking at what they thought I was and could be instead of who I was in the moment

From my understanding.. They are non binary. Being their selves has nothing to do with God. 

Non binary means that they're not a boy or girl.. Now they might want to look masc or fem or both but it doesn't change their identity. 

I'm 17 and I found out at 16..

My advice is talking with them, google, talk to people.. Learn about them and their identity. This doesn't change who they are.. 

Just try your best to use they/them and gender neutral refers.. Like instead of daughter, use kid, child, baby ect
Let me tell you, I appreciate that you are trying. I would have loved to have parents like you. Instead, I got my head slammed in a dryer door. I am so, so glad that you are choosing to support your child. Keep your toxic family away from them, and I'm sure you will.

I do, however, agree with the wariness of social media lol. Nothing to do with gender or sexuality exploring, just with the fact that kids are *so* impressionable and *so* easy to get hurt on social media, either by their peers or by adults. I'm glad I was kept off social media until I was in high school, tbh. But if they've already grown accustomed to being on social media, well, I'm not sure how you'd handle that battle if it were one you were to choose.
Lots of things have been said, but I didn’t see this. Explore your own gender and share with your child when you’re asking them about theirs. What makes you feel like the gender you present? What makes you feel euphoric in your gender? What makes you feel a little icky? Nothing related to your body, what you do for others, etc. Just things that you feel internally and why. It’s a really good way to get to understand why someone else needs to live in line with those feelings in themself, no matter how young they are. Think back to when you were a kid and what complex things you understood about yourself and the people around you, how intense your emotions were. Kids get it. They need space to explore their identities, and if you explore with them it won’t be one sided vulnerability.
Hello! as a nonbinary person without kids i can't give much advice on the handling family side but I just want to tell you that acceptance and an attempt means the absolute world. It doesn't matter if you mess up, just the willingness to try, to have that much respect for you to try and love for the kid you have over the one you thought you did means a lot. And while being nonbinary is different for almost everyone who is, and it's a lot to put into one comment, I want to open my DMs to you for any questions you might have! Finding information is hard and there's the worry of imposing on others, so I'd like you to know that I'd be happy to answer any questions you may have about your child's identity, their experience, and how they'd probably like to be treated while navigating their self-discovery : D
I'm the (nonbinary) parent of a trans teen too. Its HARD to defend to other adults that yes your kid does in fact know who they are. It's hard to come out, or tell people your kid isn't cis, in a world where that's not always safe. You're at the start of a hard journey, but you love your kid, and you want the best for them. Be there for them, defend and protect them, just as you would with any other trait about your child. 

God makes us all EXACTLY how we are. If God made you trans, you're trans. If God made you a nonbinary person, you're a nonbinary person. Far be it from me or any of your family members to question God's plan for your child. 

Your kid can be happy. They're not empty, they're not any more confused than any other 12 year old. They're figuring out who they are and you being there to support them is the best thing you can do.
Your child is the source you need to listen to for what they're going through and why they feel this way. What I encourage you to do is to take a positive but inquisitive tone with them. Ask them to help you understand, because you'll both (hopefully) learn a lot from them and understanding their reasoning and feelings. What I found helpful (and do take this with a grain of salt, everyone is different) was people reacting with honest curiosity. The more I explained myself and my feelings, the more confident I became. If they are questioning, then this is good practice with a loving and supportive person. If they already know (and I do believe that people have to experiment to know sometimes, whether it turns out to be something else or not), this helps them build resilience and learn to articulate themselves.
As someone who is non-binary at a young age rn I can tell you that the most important thing is be open. This means different things like to conversations and to changes with their gender. As well as preferences, in your post you said other members of your family were saying things. Don’t be surprised if your child doesn’t want to communicate with them and if they ( the family members) are saying something mean and homophobicly rude.  Lastly let them tell you stuff when you are ready
You're child came out as non-binary right? You kept mentioning them as daughter here (it can hurt)
But don't let them around your child. I had a grandma who said these things, I'm no longer a Christian because she made me feel broken.
Ask them what terms they want you to use. They might want to be called your daughter but they might prefer child or son. Open conversations are something i wish i had with my parents. You might see a doctor about puberty blockers if they're interested. Take time and do your research about queer things. Use their pronouns and name as best you can and correct others. Let them experiment with clothes and hair and expression. Affirming their gender is suicide prevention. Overall just let them know how loved they are.
Just wanted to hop on here and offer encouragement! I’m really happy for your child figuring out who they are! And I’m ecstatic for you, reaching out to the community your child is beginning to enter into and get to know is so wonderful! It shows how much you love them and are willing to learn and communicate in healthy ways! Please keep it up! 

And as for your family members giving pushback, always support and respect your child’s feelings around any family member. And as much as you want to, you can’t always change everyone’s minds. And it’s okay. Your kid just needs to know you’ve got their back and that they’re safe with you. 

Please keep up the good work. We need more supportive moms willing to get educated and grow. 💕
If they want to use they them pronouns then maybe dial back on using she her. Even when not talking to them. It is good practice and I know I would be deeply hurt is I found out someone was only respecting my pronouns to my face . It takes time and being consistent with it helps you remember. Also definitely have a talk with them about what they are comfortable with being called and be aware that labels can change especially since they are so young.
everyone else has already said all the important things, so i'm just here to chime in as a happy, fullfilled 34 year old enby.

when i was a child there were no words for ppl like me. i was still nonbinary, but i was alone and afraid. i bound my chest in unsafe ways, i was incapable of forming meaningful relationships with others (because i was unable to be myself), and i was ultimately traumatized by trying to be a cisgender binary person. i felt like an impossible thing.

then the internet happened and i found my words.

i came out at 21 and i've been out in all areas of my life ever since. i've been medically transitioning in nonlinear ways that work for me, i'm wealthy in the chosen queer family department, i know who i am, and i get to be my authentic self. i feel extremely, extremely grateful to be alive and nonbinary.

i'm sure you know this, but your nonbinary child is a treasure. you're lucky to have them and they're lucky to have a parent like you. just know that your child's future is bright and that trans joy is real, regardless of what's happening in some parts of the world. this is a fantastic community and you seem like a great parent.
Hello! To second what a lot of people said, good on you for being supportive; many queer and trans kids don’t have that luxury. Your willingness to learn is a good start. 

Be on the lookout for dysphoria, anxiety, people’s comments around them (looking at your family and strangers), and be their biggest advocate! It’s hard to stand up for yourself, especially that young. Correct others for them - IF they say that’s okay and what they want. Keeping an open line of communication is key!

To add a couple of points that I haven’t seen yet:

Another possibility as to why they would choose they/them is because they’re a type of non-binary called “genderfluid.” This means that sometimes they may feel feminine, sometimes masculine, sometimes a mix of both, sometimes neither, sometimes like a girl, sometimes like a boy, or any combination of those - I’m genderfluid and use they/them because it’s easier thank asking people to switch pronouns based on how I’m feeling. Only they can truly tell you their experience with gender identity. 

Another thing to ask them about would be gender expression. Do they want to change their haircut or style? Do they want new clothes? New shoes? It can be expensive but it can help them feel so much more comfortable with their body and valid in their identity!

It might be a phase, it might not be. Hell, even at 19 I’m still figuring myself out, and that includes my gender identity and preferred pronouns. Do NOT discount or write off their experiences no matter what comes next. They’re figure themselves out, and it’s a beautiful journey. I’m glad they trust you to take with them❤️
The only thing you can do here is trust your child to know their identity, and provide them with all the love and security you would have given them had they not come out to you. It sounds as though these family members are the ones who are putting your child in danger of being confused.
Well, the way they feel about pronouns isn’t about choice, it’s just a feeling, it’s hard to explain, but it’s there and your kid is feeling it too. Please don’t let them around those family members alone as it could put your kid in danger. I’m glad you are open to it and are willing to help them explore their gender openly. At first adjusting to the new pronouns may be difficult, but once you get the hang of it, it will be easy. Using these pronouns for your kid will really help their mental health. Definitly ask about different labels such as whether they’d rather be called “daughter”, “child”, “kid”, “niece”, you know, those sorts of terms. Find out what they are comfortable with and they kind of language and compliments they prefer too: “pretty” “handsome” “cute” etc.
So I have some resources that might be able to help like books and other posts!!!

Please feel free to stop by r/transgenderhelp and ask us questions and we will guide you!!
You've got a lot of amazing comments to reference already, that have a lot of great advice and resources. I just wanted to let you know that I'm a non-binary person in my 20s, and have been openly non-binary for a decade (came out in my teen years). If you ever feel like talking to a non-binary person who went through teenagehood as a non-binary person could help you with any more specific questions that come up while you're learning, I'm open to DMs! (I'm not always great with responding quickly, so time-sensitive things would be better taken elsewhere when possible)

I know there were so many things about my experiences I couldn't articulate as a teenager that I now have the language for, and while I obviously can't speak for your kid or know what's going on in their head, I can let you know my own perspectives, both how I feel about certain things now, and how I felt about them as a teenager. My parents didn't have a lot of resources when I first came out, and it was hard for all of us because they couldn't understand things and I couldn't explain those things. I'm very happy to try and provide parents help so that things can be a little easier for families than it was for mine.
Hi, OP, everyone is already giving incredible advice, so I just wanted to say thank you in conjunction with everyone here who has already said so. Thank you for reaching out to this space, and thank you for doing your best to support your child. It means so much to me, and many other people here, to see a parent like you doing your best to learn and be supportive. I wish you and your child nothing but the best. 💖💖💖
I wish you were my mum :”) your kiddo is very lucky
Ok so... I'm nonbinary. I've been nonbinary since I can remember, but I grew up in the 90's, before social media was a thing. I remember being 6-10 years old and wanting less gender affirming clothing, short hair, and a gender neutral name. This was long before the use of pronouns was a thing. I remember at one point *wanting* something like a they/them identifier but it was 1999 so it wasn't a thing yet. 

I'm 30 years old now, and I'm still nonbinary. I'm just glad there's a name for it now, there wasn't when I was growing up. 

A couple of years ago, I realized something. I don't know if this counts for everyone, but in my case, I realized that a lot of my gender identity preferences had less to do with how I felt about my own body, and more about the way others perceived it. All the gender roles, social expectations, and ""rules"" for each gender seemed a bit arbitrary to me. It used to revolve more around how I played, but now it's evolved a bit. I still get a bit of judgement for being the one that cuts the grass and takes out the trash, and being the breadwinner while my AMAB spouse is the homemaker. 

I wish I had a better way to explain it, other than my own experience. But to me, being nonbinary isn't so much about how I feel about my own body, it just feels like the world is trying to cram me into a box. There's a male box and a female box, and each box has its own limitations. But I don't want limitations. I just want to be me.
Nonbinary isn't a hard label. It leaves room for all kinds of expression and changes later in life. Your kid may feel restricted or limited with the clothing choices and the enforced role of femininity. 
 
Your kid may be saying ""I need space to figure out my own gender expression. I don't feel like a girl but I'm not sure if I feel like a boy. I would like time to think about my identity and explore different methods of expressing myself""
You're lucky your kid trusts you enough to tell you who they are. No one else can tell you more than they know about themselves. Try to honor that. There's nothing negative about this. This isn't a choice and more than being gay is. Changing pronouns just means you realized , hey, it feels wrong when people call me this, I am more comfortable being referred to in this is way instead. There isn't much more to it. Just like some people like or maybe just don't mind being called he or she, it can be upsetting for others. Media did help me because I never saw anyone living as I wish I could. It gave me courage because I realized If they can live as themselves then so can I. When everyone around you is denying who you are, then yeah, there are plenty of people like us who your kid can come to. And we will support them because we know what it's like and we know we are real and we don't want your kid to go through what we did (years of stuffing it down til you can't keep living that way). The world can make room for us. It's not too hard to understand. But I think most people have simply never considered gender. And we now know that it is largely arbitrary to uphold the idea that men and women are the only option and that it is determined by what's in your pants. What do we lose if we admit that we have to power of self determination? Mostly bigots from our lives.
Hey They/them here.


I have always struggled with my gender. For a long time I thought about transition -ftm- but their are days I feel feminine and days I feel more like a man and days I feel like well both!!! It’s not really a choice it was the way god made me. It took a while for my family to get used to but as long as you try they will appreciate it, hell even when my dad makes crappy dad math Jokes about it I still know he truly trying to understand that I was just made a little different then everyone else.


Yes their are family members that still call me she/her but I still love them and try to understand that they are trying
Anyone who is being judgmental can go fornicate with themselves. This is about you supporting your child (also kid, spawn, and baby). 

It is absolutely ok for you to be confused and to struggle with shifting pronouns to they/them. One of my friend is a mom to a non-binary kid, and she put an autocorrect in her phone to change ""she"" to ""they"" so she wouldn't inadvertently misgender her child. 

I knew I was different by the time I was 4, but I didn't know about being non-binary until I was in my 30s. When I was in school, the girls in my class seemed like a different species from me. I knew I wasn't a boy, but I wasn't one of them either. 

Let your kid take the lead and support whatever they want to do as long as it's safe to explore their gender - clothes, hair, name, pronouns, etc.
the fact that they are comfortable enough to share this with you is a bigger thing than you might think, so don't worry too much, you're doing good! :) the thing is, they might end up with different labels in the future but it doesn't hurt anyone to try something out. this is just the way we grow.

I was also born female and now I identify as non binary & use any pronouns. I came out (with my gender) not that long ago but honestly, if I had the words to express myself I would've came out much, much sooner.

I always enjoyed both masculine and feminine things growing up and I'm so grateful my parents let me be myself. looking back I could've known a long time ago; I always tried to mimic the men I have in my life, was afraid to present ""too"" feminine cuz I thought others would just see me as a girl and was upset by some changes in my body when I started puberty. later in life I considered if I'm a trans man but I wasn't uncomfortable with being a girl either. being non binary & using different pronouns for me means that I don't have to throw away a part of myself so I can be like a ""typical"" girl/boy. I don't have to choose between what norms  to follow so I am seen as a binary gender. it's just freedom to express myself and good vibes. :)

also, I'm christian. it's hard to keep your faith when your different. personally, I moved myself away from the church (it was toxic in other ways too) and I've been really happy. I believe that you don't have to ""show off"" with going to church and any events to believe. it can be just between you and a God and that's perfectly okay. whenever someone tries to tell me otherwise I just ask; if God hates me, why do I keep winning? :D (like truly, I have an amazing life)
First off, you kept calling your kid ""daughter"" and ""she/her"". The first step to showing support is calling them their proper pronouns and using terms they are comfortable with. Unless they specified ""daughter"" is okay, don't use that. If you're talking to them and a gendered term slips, apologize, correct yourself and move on. Talking about the issue more (Things like ""oh no I'm so sorry, I promise I'm trying. I didn't grow up with this, i have to get used to it."") can often cause dysphoria in people, not everyone but it can happen. 

It's great you came here to seek advice from other nonbinary people. The greatest piece of advice I have is to cut off or educate the family on how to be supportive. Your kid is going through changes and finding themselves. Even if they later decide that ""nonbinary"" doesn't feel right, at least they felt that support and were free to explore their identity in a safe space. Then in the future they feel safe coming to you for advice or support. 

You should prioritize your relationship with your kid above the mean comments from your family members. 

I wish them the best of luck on their journey!
People who have gender identity dissonance are always helped by gender affirming care. For some people all they need is to use different pronouns and be encouraged to dress how they want. Some people need more some less. You are their parent and they need your unconditional love and support. That means trying your best to use their pronouns and new name if that’s what they want.

Check out the book Whipping Girl by Julia Serrano.
As a parent it is your job to teach and protect your child, but also to learn and change with them.
Will addressing your child as they/them hurt them? No.
Is it something you can talk to them more on?
Yes.
Why do they feel this way? For how long?

I myself go by they/them/zir.
For me changing my pronouns was about being more comfortable with myself, I hate being call girl or lady or miss because it didn't fit with me and even felt demeaning. I was about 14 when I found a  proper term 'non-binary' and 'enby' that fit me better.

My mother has told me from her side of things, that there is a bit of a grieving involved in your child changing from what you knew, to someone who is freeing themselves to be their truest most authentic self.

It's completely valid to experience those feelings of grief, concern and doubt. But you also get to relearn who this amazing person you brought into this world is.

Best advice is talk and communicate calmly, share your concerns alow your child to do the same, because the alternative could push them away. Would you rather be there for them no matter what or potentially push them away because you didn't try.

not going to offer any advice here, just here to say that you're doing amazing. any parent this open and honest and willing to learn the steps to support their kid out of love, no matter the pushback from family or friends or social norms, is an incredible parent. my own weren't the most supportive when i came out, and im sure your child is very lucky and thankful to have you in their life. no matter how overwhelming or stressful things get, remind yourself the steps you're taking, the communication you're showing and the support you're offering are all the right things to do and your kiddo is lucky to have you. i wish you the best of luck ❤
Why they make this choice:
- they have found the words to communicate how they feel
- they (finally) feel safe enough to express themselves
- they want to feel more comfortable in their life and live as their authentic self

Are they too young to know who they are?
- no
- would you ask a someone who identifies as their agab (assigned gender at birth) that question?
- did you know when you were a kid that you were indeed a [insert agab] and not trans/non-binary?
- did you know as a kid you were cis straight?
- why would someone question their gender if they were ‘the norm’. Wouldn’t it be way easier then as everything is already spelled out for them? 

The answer is: they are finally who they are, and yes they are old enough to know who they are. This might change in the future if they find other words that better describe them, but even if they were to change their mind later, at least they are respected and well cared for by being who they are and being appreciated for who they are. Don’t fight them on their identity. They know who they are!
I think when you aren't nonbinary it's very hard to understand that experience and how it feels, which is okay, as it's not an experience you've had. If you want to understand what your kid is going through I would advise that, rather than trying to imagine being nonbinary, imagine that everyone around you insisted you were. I don't know if you are a man or a woman based on your post, but you can probably imagine that it would be alienating and strange if everybody in your life referred to you using they/them pronouns and didn't talk or think about you as a man or woman, whichever is your identity.

If you can imagine that situation, you can begin to understand the disconnect and discomfort that your child may feel when they are perceived and treated as feminine. It can feel like you're invisible.

None of this is particularly specific advice, though i do think it generally holds water. You're already doing a great job by acknowledging you need advice and seeking it out. Just talk things through as you go with your child and anyone else who can help and you'll do great. :)
You may also find [this previous discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/nq7d9n/im_writing_a_sort_of_guide_to_parents_of_trans/h0947dm/) helpful. :)
Thank you soooo very much❤️ All of this has really helped immensely. Especially since my child has trouble putting it into words themself. Sharing some of these things with them could help their confidence. Right now I am worried about them because they seem to be dealing with bad anxiety (especially social related) and maybe depression. Unfortunately a lot of this wonderful stuff runs in our family. Is there a local support group usually for youth in the LGBQT+ community? I feel like a lot of it might be because they feel alone in all this.
Something Else Interesting To Bring Up Is The First Known Complaint About Singular They Was In The 18th Century, If Memory Serves, Over 300 Years After It Started Being Used. Interestingly Enough, I Found Many Of The Oldest Sources Saying Singular ""They"" Is Bad Also Disliked ""He Or She"" And Variants, Instead Desiring The Masculine ""He"" Be Used Generically.
They just turned 12 but I swear they are going on 30. They told me they were Pansexual when they were 10. They are actually more emotionally and mentally mature than most adults I know. Their dad and I have been very supportive. Your advice is very helpful. Thank you so much for the insight. I am more than willing to stand up for my amazing child but unfortunately I have a very low self esteem and doubt myself and my parenting. My relatives are all too happy to tell me I’m wrong and over step.
Thank you I really appreciated your sincere words and they really made sense. Reading your explanation and the ones above have really opened my eyes and helped me understand the whole idea/community better. It is also making me feel more secure in standing up against those I know are going to not understand. I want to always be in my child’s corner.
Well that’s the thing my daughter is only 12 and feels like she needs to decide now what she needs to go by. She’s putting a lot of pressure on herself. I will support her no matter what and begin using the pronouns she chooses when or if she chooses them but right now she is just feeling very confused. She came out as Pansexual several years ago and her father and I have been very supportive. When I asked her about why she might want to go by they/ them or could she describe to me why she felt she needed to be called that just so I could understand… she said that she had not quite decided it and couldn’t quite put it in words of her own exactly. She just felt safe enough to share with me that she was contemplating it very seriously.
Wow, I am just blown away by the support and all the information you are giving me. I am actually feeling so excited and hopeful. I can’t wait to share a lot of this with my child and tell them about my new understanding then explain how we have backup ammunition to support us in the fight against the negativity from those who don’t understand.
I’m really glad you brought this up! I’ve heard about this before from a trans friend at work. I believe she mentioned she dealt with it. Someone else did mention for a moment in the comments before about this but didn’t quite explain. I was going to look it up. Thank you for explaining a bit. The way your bringing it up it does sound a lot like what they might be experiencing.  I don’t know if I should just bring it up to their regular counselor or get a referral to the counselor who specializes in these things.
I totally believe in that. My mother and some other family members are unfortunately on the other spectrum of that. In my mind God loves everyone no matter what and I’m ashamed of how most Christians act now a days. I will definitely be looking into a church where my child can feel welcome and we can cross out that negative influence that my mom and other relatives have been lathering on. Thank you❤️❤️❤️
Thank you so much!! You sound like one the the most beautiful souls I have ever met! I feel so awful for all those who were not unconditionally supported by their parents. Doesn’t matter if you got pregnant really early or came out as gay. Your parents should have your back and support you no matter what. Even before my daughter came to me about who she was I have had an open heart because I too believe God loves everyone. I believe that a person is born this way and God does not make mistakes. He wants us to truly be who we are. To express the beautiful gifts inside us. I am honestly appalled by how most Christians act nowadays. “Judge not lest ye be judged” and “You who is without sin, throw the first stone”…. My fellow Christians must have forgotten those. So busy bothering people who are doing nothing but being true to themselves and expressing love in a form that might be different than what they know but it’s love just the same.
I’m so sorry your family does not support you. That breaks my heart. Sending you mental hugs across the miles. 🤗❤️
u/AdultingMakesMeCrazy I saw your reply about re-reading your comments but I can't see it anymore. I typed this reply but it didn't post, so here it is

&#x200B;

Thank you for being receptive and re-reading your replies. It's understandable to be overwhelmed, especially if this is the first time you have a non-binary person in your life. You (and everyone) are gonna make mistakes and sometimes it'll upset people but as long as you're willing to learn from it and keep trying, that's all anyone can ask!

  
I don't know if your child has dysphoria or not, and honestly they might not know either. When I first came out I didn't think I had dysphoria, but soon I realized that I did and it was quite bad. If they do have dysphoria, it might hurt to be misgendered even if you recognize someone as trying. If they get upset when misgendered, it is probably not from thinking that you're not trying, but because it can hurt.

  
It's not uncommon for non-binary and/or trans people to overcompensate as their agab before realizing. For example, some trans and/or nonbinary people who were afab were heavily into makeup and other traditionally feminine interests, and looking back feel it was a mask. Some people might've avoided things associated with their agab, but now feel comfortable with those things in a non-gendered way. That was something that confused my parents about how much changed after I initially came out. It might take some time to figure themself out, their style out, they may initially want to keep their name but also might decide to try others. I think you will do great, as long as you stay open minded and receptive
^^^^^
OP said that her daughter was considering it, not that she had officially come out as it
Your post is very wise. Especially the advice your dad gave you. I agree so very much with his saying or advice.
If anyone sounds lovely it’s you 🤗❤️
Wow, that was one amazing comment and made me think of my Aunt Kathy that I looked up to. She had a way with words and wisdom and looking at the world. She was a very beautiful, old soul. I loved every word. Thank you ❤️🤗
Thank you so much I really appreciate this❤️
Thank you for your comments and insight. My child still seems to be deciding but when that decision is made I will be respectful of it❤️🤗
The support in your comment really meant the world to me. Thank you so much for the uplifting words and insight❤️
Thank you so much❤️ that’s some good advice. And I’m glad I made your day🤗 Everyone here is making mine by being so supportive and helpful.
I’m so sorry that your family was like this. My mom is the one who is a Christian like that. I promised myself I would never become someone with such a closed heart. I have always believed that God loves and accepts everyone. There are so many Christians out there that offend me and give Christianity a bad name. They mold the Bible into what they want it to say. Jesus was about love and forgiveness . One of his most prominent stories in the Bible has him saying “you without sin, cast the first stone”… when they were about to stone a woman for her sin. We are all equals. None of us the right to act like we are better than another.
Oh wow, you have such a beautiful soul❤️ your mother is really missing out! Don’t let her confusion and negativity pull you away from your peace. I believe in you
I keep hoping that the family in question will get their crap together and listen to me when I say that this is who they are and this is what they need to be happy. These people know not to say things in front of them. If a person did they would no longer be going around them. I have them in counseling but it doesn’t seem to be helping. Maybe I have the wrong counselor. They have already said almost two years ago that they decided they were Pansexual but is just now feeling like non-binary pronouns might be part of who they are. They are not sure. They are only 12 and feel like they need  to figure out everything out now.  I just want to support them and give them the best advice
I am so sorry your mom made you feel like that. At first I would let my mom bully me into trying to get them to be more feminine or dress nicer… because among my many issues I am codependent. But thankfully I realized before I ruined my relationship with my child that my mom needs a lot more help than I do. So now my child never has to wear a dress unless they choose to (it would probably be more of a pantsuit and rainbow colored). Even at a family get together or whatever. I say be yourself just wear something clean. They even have shirts that are obviously supporting gay rights or hats and pins like that … they ask me if it’s ok to wear to a  gathering and I tell them if someone can’t except you for the way you are.. they aren’t worth your time or mine….. so wear whatever you want.
Leo’s Guide to “Transness”

Terms you may not be familiar with or have the wrong definition to:

Cisgender: someone who does identify as their assigned gender at birth

Transgender: someone who doesn’t identify with their assigned gender at birth

Non-binary: someone who doesn’t identify with a binary gender, male or female. (Non-binary is not a third gender that exclusively uses they/them pronouns. It’s an umbrella term that applies to many genders that are not male or female, but you can identify as just non-binary)

Gender non-conforming: someone who doesn’t not fit into societal gender roles. Not all gnc people are trans, but they may face similar discrimination with trans people. You can be cis or trans and be gnc.

Genderfluid: someone whose gender fluctuates or changes. One day they might feel masculine. The next they could feel like nothing in particular. Then maybe they’ll feel feminine.

Agender: someone who doesn’t have/feel/ a gender, or doesn’t have a strong enough feeling of their gender to label it

Genderqueer: what a lot of people think gnc is. Pretty similar to the non-binary label. Kind of up to the person. Usually someone who doesn’t identify on the gender binary. Other reason could be: not have a clear label of their gender, having multiple genders, having no gender, etc.

Trans man: someone who’s not biologically male that identifies as a man.

Trans masc: someone who’s trans but feels more masculine or presents masculine (not necessarily feels like a man)

Trans woman: someone who is not biologically female that identifies as a woman

Trans fem: someone who is trans and identifies femininely/presents femininely (not necessarily feels like a woman)

Deadname/given name/birthname: someones given name at birth

Deadnaming: calling someone by their birth name (big no no)

Agab: assigned gender at birth

Afab/amab: assigned female/male at birth

Taboos, No No’s, and other Tips and Tricks

Deadnaming is a very big no. Some people are okay with it but never ever do so without asking. It’s very hurtful and usually causes dysphoria or reminds you and other people that we are trans. 

Outing people is never okay. Some people aren’t ready to be out yet. And outing them without their consent can sometimes put them in danger.

Calling someone “a transgender”. It’s objectifying. I am transgender not a transgender. (Very similar to queer. Calling someone a queer vs queer has two very different meanings)

Transsexual is a very outdated term. Before people were really aware of non binary people they only assumed trans people were ftm or mtf (female to male and vice versa). Being transgender was just going through surgery to “change your sex”. That is no longer the case. Some people still identify as that term but that is only up to them. So never use it unless someone specifically asks you to.

Tr*nsvestite (not sure if slurs are banned) usually describes a cross dresser or someone that dresses in the “opposite” clothing for sexual pleasure. It’s commonly used as a derogatory term towards trans people, usually trans women.

Tr*nny is another derogatory term. Some people may still identify as it. Unfortunately the meaning was taken away and turned into a slur. 

Pronouns don’t equal gender. I use they/he pronouns but I don’t identify as a man because I use he/him pronouns. Someone could be cisgender and use she/they pronouns. Someone could use all pronouns and not identify as every gender. I’m sure you get my point. 

(Feel free to add anything I missed)
That is a lot of really amazing, helpful input❤️ Thank you for taking the time to do that and open your heart🤗🌻 I am so very sorry your mother does not support you. That breaks my heart. Sending you ‘mental’ hugs across the miles. My child did ask about binding, especially since they are uncomfortable with their chest. But yes binding sounds so scary to me. I’m afraid of them hurting themselves. Especially since they are still growing. Are restrictive/high impact sports bras a good compromise till they get older? I just want to do the best thing to make them feel themselves but be safe.
I know it took you some time and care to put this all down for me ❤️ And let me tell you I appreciate it more than I can put into words. I want to be aware of everything that’s going to connect with my child’s world and make sure I’m  learning to become a better, more rounded human being at the same time. I’ve always supported the LGBTQ+ community even when I was younger. I had some really good friends from some of the communities back in the day (cause I’m old, at least that’s what my kid says lol). But now it’s been more difficult to make any kind of friendships being a stay at home mom. I want to get caught up on things. Become an advocate if I could. It just makes me so said that so many parents don’t support their kids out there. My kid and I are going to the local Pride parade and I got a shirt that says “Free Mom Hugs”. My kid picked it out for me❤️
This is amazing! Thank you so much! I will take you up on your offer
I really appreciate the info you offered for me to check out❤️ I need all the info I can get🤗 and thank you so much for you positivity and support
I'm not sure where you're located, but there are a *lot* of support groups around the world for folks like us. PFLAG would be a good place to start, or their school's GSA. I'll add that it's okay for *you* to need support, too. While I recommend a supportive gender therapist for anyone going through this process, it's also a good idea for parents to have their own support structure. While your focus should be on providing support for your kid, you also need support for the work that *you* are going to do during this process, and that's okay.
I just want to say that I can tell you love your child very much and it’s great that you came here for advice. It’s also very nice to see that you switched to they/them pronouns, I know (as someone with parents lol) that even the smallest things like that can be very validating even if they don’t see it happening. I hope that you are both able to continue exploring this together and get the resources that you need to help them ❤️
Gender Spectrum https://genderspectrum.org/ is another great resource for trans and non-binary youth and their families! They have a glossary you might find helpful, and facilitated online groups for kids and teens.
depending on how populated where you live is there is almost always LGBTQ+ youth support groups, usually with age restrictions and adult coordinators to foster a genuine safe space. i'd just research around your area to see if any resources are around like that for you and your kid :)
Also, please don't talk about them as ""she."" They asked you to refer to them as they/them, and it's best to do it even if they're not around to hear/read it. It's always good to practice their correct pronouns and getting used to it, plus, it rubs us all the wrong way if you use the pronouns that they told you not to use. You will sometimes slip up and that's fine as long as you try to refer to them correctly. Soon enough, it will be natural for you to talk about them as they/them.

Anyway, props and all the glory to you for being an amazing parent and making an active effort to support your child, you're doing great by reaching out to us ♥️
I was also considered very emotionally and mentally mature, and I hope you can find a good balance between respecting your kid's maturity and still protecting them, I know it's hard for a lot of parents to do that. I think it's good that you came to a nonbinary space for advice on this, honestly, not a whole lot of parents do.
Dude I would have given anything to have parents like y'all, it sounds like you're doing amazing. Especially if you kid feels so comfortable expressing themselves and who they are to you.
Hey this might make you feel a little better- I realized I was nonbinary/trans at 13 :) for me things started to get funky when I was 10 and started puberty, so from my experience that age is completely normal to start questioning/figuring themself out. My partner realized he was bi at 10, and the only reason I didn’t realize I was nonbinary sooner was because I grew up in a very sheltered household. As soon as I became aware of what nonbinary meant, it was like all these big complicated feelings I’d experienced my whole life suddenly made sense- so I wouldn’t call it a choice 😅 this is just who I am! My biggest advice would be to listen to your kid and give them the love and support they need to be themself first and foremost. I didn’t have supportive parents (my mom actually bullied me into not coming out till I finally got the courage at 21), and I think just knowing my parents had my back and loved me regardless would’ve helped me a lot. Even now I still wish my parents were supportive lmfao. 
Also, as far as your religious relatives go, please keep your child safe from them. I was in religious education from ages 12-18 and it completely destroyed my sense of self. I’m still dealing with the trauma from that time in my life 4+ years later. 
You have a very good heart, and it makes me so happy to see a parent who wants to be there for and help their child in whatever way they can. :)
you don’t have to be perfect, but you’re learning and trying and growing. you’re going to save your kid so much pain and they’ll never forget it.
Messing up pronouns is okay (for the first little while), but immediately (or try to) correct yourself. You won't catch it every time, but making an effort is 100% much better than just ""she goes by they/them.""

Pro tip: talk with them about which relatives it's safe to come out to/use gender neutral language in front of, and which they'd rather wait on. And be sure to respect that. Accidentally slipping a ""they"" to a relative said relative likely won't notice, but this is where you learn selective gendering - pronouns one way one minute and flipping the script for another set the next. As a closeted person, I had to do that a lot.
I came out as pan when I was ten and non-binary at 12. The journey of self discovery can be at any age
Gender affirming therapist here!  I agree with the above!  I work with kids too and imo the trifecta of teen trans support is this:  supportive home and family (this is non negotiable) trans affirmative medical support (like yesterday) and finally but still as important queer social support (friends, camps, therapy support groups, and other queer community).  Hope this helps!  Feel free to DM with questions.
The fact that you are already using they/them pronouns for them shows how much you care. You’re going to do great, and as a non-binary person I would love to have you as a mom.
You’re not wrong to support your child. My 10 year old is very much more mature than I was. You’re doing great! There is a great book called Genderqueer by Mia Kobabe, it’ll help you understand and see it in a way that breaks down the old archaic walls society has put up <3 your kiddo will probably like it too, it’s a graphic novel.
I started having feelings of not being cis when I was 7, it intensified when I was around their age as I hit puberty and took me until now (17) to accept that I'm trans. If I had a parent like you, who were willing to hear me out and educate themselves, maybe it wouldn't have taken me 10 years of denial to finally accept it. You're doing great, keep supporting your kid, it's a journey of self-discovery for both of you.
I hope someone has said this, but in addition to all the care and work you're already doing in this thread by showing this wonderful change in behavior and effort towards supporting your kid - but one of the best things you can do, for your kid's safety with the family and for your own happiness, is giving yourself more credit and believing in yourself and your parenting. You raised an amazing kid who trusts you with these aspects of themselves, these relatives that overstep can get lost! You're doing great.
Well, if what you've said here is any indication, I think you're doing a great job. Your child is lucky to have you.
The fact that you are here is honestly the sweetest parenting move. You are choosing to let your child express themselves and learn about themselves how they know best. 

I took time to figure it all out but access to the internet means more visibility for people and youngsters who are questioning. Please look for good role models for your kiddo in the LGBT world. You may find some you will look up to also :)
Oh ya, that's just cause you raised them well. Stable caring environments lead to rapid emotional growth. They are still young so they still depend on that stability to express more complex and nuanced understanding. When they grow up they can continue that practice of developing and providing a strong stable environment for themselves and others around them.
Definitely work on your own self esteem. Your relatives likely contributed to that problem. You deserve to feel good in your own skin and choices. You are doing a great job.
I think the fact that you have doubts about your parenting shows you ARE a good parent tbh. because you actually care and want the best for your child. you're doing fine mama keep it up 💖💖
I am sorry you deal with low self-esteem and overbearing relatives at the same time.

But let me just say, the trust of a trans child is so precious, they must really love and believe in you to have told you their truth. Many of us don't trust another soul until well into adulthood, and sadly some never do. The fact that they've showed you this part of themself really speaks to how they view your relationship. If you're ever feeling down on yourself, try to remember this, because they'll need you to maintain that love and trust more than ever. 💜

I’m really glad you found us over here, it says a lot that you were even willing to ask and even more that you are actually willing to learn! I’m really glad that I was able to help.
I think it’s important to remember that your kid can only figure out if using they/them pronouns feels right if someone uses them. When I came out as non-binary I said I was thinking about using they/them pronouns because I thought this language would soften the blow to others but it just created an out for them to never use those pronouns. 

I can’t speak for your child but I’d try using gender neutral language from now on. If your kid decides they don’t actually wanna use those pronouns they’ll let you know. But they won’t know if their comfortable if the person they’ve trusted to help them figure things out isn’t using them. 

Maybe start by asking “is it okay to say you’re my daughter or would you prefer if I call you my child?” Or maybe try using “they/them” in front of your kid for a day. At the end check in and see how the day of different pronouns made them feel.
In my experience when someone says “I’ve been thinking about using they/them pronouns” it means that they are sincerely asking you to use those pronouns for them but don’t feel confident asserting that as a direct demand. It’s not that they are unsure about wanting to use neutral pronouns, it’s that they are unsure if you are a safe person to make that request of. If you start using they/them for your kid you will show them you are a safe person to keep sharing with. But If you keep saying “her” waiting for a confident declaration they may just decide that you aren’t safe to talk to. It sounds like you may be the only family member who wants to support them so you really have to step up and make an effort here or your kid will feel like they don’t have anyone on their side. Using the pronouns someone has asked (or hinted about) is the essential to showing you respect them. Use they/them and call them your kid/child until they tell you otherwise.

If your child is nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns now, that is something you should respect to show them you're listening. They might be saying they want to always be nonbinary or they might not and it's okay for people to change. They might come out as transmasc with he/him pronouns later, or say they're fluid between multiple genders, or stay the way they say they are now. (Don't be surprised if their name changes too.) You'll make them feel much more comfortable talking to you about their identify in the future if you believe what they say about themself, refer to them the way they believe they should be referred to now, and defend their right to self identify as any gender or sexuality. Ultimately, they're the same child, with a new set of words describing them. You'll probably want to do a lot of research about trans people. Learn what trans people say about themselves, rather than what non-trans people feel about trans people, because you'll learn more about how your kid feels about themself that way (and non-trans people on the internet who go out of their way to talk about trans people tend to be judgemental and hateful- not a good place to get information from if you want a good relationship with your kid).
okay it’s good that your kid feels comfortable enough to come to you with these things, but you literally just responded to “respect your child’s pronouns” by continuing to call them she/her and your daughter. i know its likely a hard transition for you, but typing is the absolute easiest way to make sure you’re referring to them correctly. because you can backspace and fix it. get better about it with strangers on the internet or you’ll never get better about it in front of your kid.
I'm glad my explanation was helpful! In regards to what therapist to see, I really would recommend seeing a gender therapist. A normal therapist is not required to learn how to handle gender identity issues. 

I think another important thing to mention is that your child might not feel comfortable talking to you about it if they do experience dysphoria, and it's possible they might not even know the word for it. Also, I am not sure if I explained it well, but non-binary people can indeed feel dysphoria around their bodies. I know in my case, as a non-binary person, I experienced a lot of dysphoria around that age and I never told anyone nor gave anyone reason to suspect anything was wrong. I felt a lot of shame around it and was scared what everyone would think. I started feeling dysphoria around my name as early as kindergarten. I didn't experience any dysphoria around my body until puberty started, but when it started, I didn't feel safe talking about my dysphoria and ended up self-harming to cope, and hiding that too. I'm not saying that this is the case with your child, but it's important to understand that it's a very real possibility that your child does already have dysphoria or might develop it in the coming years.

Edit: Wanted to add that dysphoria can show up as symptoms like anxiety, depression, dissociation, and/or symptoms similar to cPTSD.
I had a religious upbringing and was deeply uncomfortable with queer people before realising I was one of them. If it helps, you could tell your mother that there is nothing about trans or nonbinary people in the Bible. Jesus preached acceptance and compassion, and was happy to be associated with people such as sex workers, who were considered social outcasts. In my experience, the objection that many Christian people have to trans and NB people is that 'we were created in God's image, and disliking or wanting to change something about yourself goes against God's will.' If your mother says something like that, ask her how she feels about people dying their hair, getting breast implants, wearing makeup, etc. Why are some changes okay but not others?
Aw, girl. You just made me tear up. Again, I just have to say that people like you affirm my faith in humanity, not just spiritual things. You're a true Christian and a warrior for peace, how could God not love and protect you and your kid? May they bless and keep you both, always.

Thank you, truly.
Thank you I really, really appreciate your sincere 🥰words❤️ especially all the info you gave me about Dysphoria and other things to be aware of. I really want to be the best mom I can for them. Hugs
Thank you! What a lovely message to wake up to after retrieving a lost Pikachu at 5:45 am. XD Hashtag parenting is never quite what you expected but you gotta roll with it.
I mean the best advice you can give them is you love and support them, that they don't have to figure any of this stuff out right now! Yeah, I would look at getting her another counselor who deals specifically with LGBT youth if possible. Some LGBT centers also have support groups for parents of LGBT youth, that might be helpful for you also in understanding them and how best to support them.
As someone with top dysphoria I wouldn’t suggest binding so young. Just because of how risky it can be. That could maybe be an option in the future, but you really have to be safe about it. Sports bras are a really good option. Just make sure they’re getting the right size and not one that’s too small. Another thing that helps top dysphoria is the type of clothing you wear. Stay clear from stretchy, thin, or clingy material. Any shirts that highlight boobs or waistline. So basically no shirts that are “womens’ cut”. I’ve noticed thicker, shorter, and wider shirts seem to eliminate the shape of my boobs. I’m not sure what style of clothing your kid likes to wear but there’s shirts I get from a store called Zumiez that I pass a lot more in because it doesn’t highlight my chest. [This shirt](https://www.zumiez.com/welcome-baja-stripe-ivory-t-shirt.html) specifically and others in that shape. Depending on chest size and style of the shirt stripes are usually a no go but I’ve noticed that they’re just fine on these types of shirts for me personally. Mens or unisex hoodies are a good option. As long as it’s not too hot. Button up shirts are one of my favorites. You can layer them and keep them open and they’ll hide any side boob. Or you can wear them as just a shirt and they really don’t highlight boobs. As long as it’s not a tight one. More loose. If you absolutely have to wear something tight like a tank top because it’s summer, then darker colors are your best friend. They don’t show your chest as much. I can wear tighter black shirts because there’s not really a shadow or any depth highlighting my chest. Avoid v shaped neck lines on shirts or sweaters they’re usually meant to highlight cleavage. Any thick sweater, or crewnecks. Tucking your shirt in and pulling it out [like this](https://pin.it/1gGeiIx) creates a pocket where your chest has room to breathe and it doesn’t get highlighted. Also if anything has a tight waist it will highlight the chest. Which you can use a sports bra to try and fix or avoid those types of clothing. If you have high waisted pants and tuck a shirt in that’s too short or too thin it will show your chest. If you want to still highlight your waist but cover your chest you can either do the lil tuck and pull with the shirt or hopefully be covered enough with a sports bra, and possibly a button up shirt layered over. 

If you need any help figuring out how to put that into an outfit just ask me, and I can totally show you my personal outfits. I can explain what I’m doing with the clothes, so you can hopefully help out your child.
Thank you soooo very much❤️❤️❤️ I really mean it! I can’t believe how much support I’m getting. I’m literally sitting here in tears feeling so much better about the future. You have no idea how much this has really helped.
Thank you❤️ I am definitely going to look into that for them. They need a safe space besides home to express their true selves without worry.
Sorry for not realize what I was doing and really focus on my pronouns. I went back and tried to fix a lot of my comments. I am a bit overwhelmed with everything and other things going on in our lives so I’m not being 100%. I didn’t mean to offend anyone and I am really so thankful for all the support and information I have been given. Thank you for opening my eyes
Christians love to mystify children. Sooo intelligent mature etc. But they are just children. Christianity has a problem with infantilizing adult women and molesting minors. Id steer clear of seeing your child as anything but a child, developmentally. My parents did that to me and i wish they had not. It causes a lot of stress on the child to grow up too fast. It also isolates your child from their peers to think “they are not like other children.”

As far as exposure to the internet and such, many Christians are groomers (like your parents and my grandparents) that only talk about bad influence and exposure when a child is exposed to something they disagree with or that threatens their work in grooming certain values into the child. For instance, all the “bad influence” friends just so happen to be poorer, POC, LGBTQ+, Indigenous, etc. All the “bad influence” media just so happens to be non-Christian. All “bad influence teachers” just so happen to not be nuns, preachers, or ppl passing on their values. There’s no end. Essentially, they just want full control of your child’s mind. It is how they maintain their christian legacy. No matter what they say, it is of historic, divine, and political necessity that they influence your child. What the top reply says is SO RIGHT. Do not let them near your child, especially alone. My grandparents got ahold of me only a few times in my childhood and each of those times were… scarring. 

As far as your child being enby and pansexual, its not a big deal. They dont identify with either side of the gender binary (man or woman) and can love any kind of person. That is all it means. What i assume is hardest to wrap your head around is how someone could so easily NOT adopt the gender and sexuality orthodoxy and what it means for who they will become and if they will want you in their life. What you need to do is keep the philosophical work of understanding the gender binary on yourself. The more you know about feminism and the gender binary and how patriarchy and society create and maintain social categories, the easier it will be to understand someone who does not identify with those categories. Simultaneously, read some books by enbys and pansexuals. Fiction or nonfiction. It is important that you try and find as diverse set of authors you can and that they be enby or pan. (Children’s books written by them too for your kid, after reviewing them to make sure they are appropriate in content according to your values, of course). It is a different way of thinking and the one of the next best things apart from talking to ppl (like you did reaching out to us on this sub) is listening to pan and enby voices through their literature. 

Hope that helps! Good luck to you and your child :)
Sending big mental hugs your way for saying such a sweet thing and going through what you have. 🤗🤗❤️
Real, i felt that too and i prolly woulda realized if i knew those words existed
I’m so sorry your dealing with this trauma😢 Sending mental hugs across the miles🤗❤️ Thank you for the wonderfully kind words and advice. It does help to know that you knew so early. I guess to me it feels like such a big thing like something I might not figure out till I was at least a little bit older than my child is now. But I guess that’s the mom in me talking. I just don’t want them to grow up and have to deal with this world the way it can be with anyone who doesn’t conform or is different. I mean I was just a brainy, nerdy poor kid and that got me all kinds of picked on. I just want to keep the world from hurting my child but I know I can’t. It makes me feel so powerless.
That means a lot thank you

🤗❤️hugs , your words mean more than you know
🥰🤗 you have no idea how much that means to me because most days I don’t feel like it
Adding on to this great advice, just run it by your child to see who they would like you to use their pronouns around. Referring to them as they/them when talking to other people might out them, so it's a good idea to see who your kid would be comfortable with knowing about the situation. :)
That is a VERY good point! Thank you for bringing that up. I will start doing that.
I will definitely take that seriously. It makes perfect sense. They have a low sense of self esteem so maybe they are worried about how people will react? They came to me and their father two years ago and got a lot of support when they told us they were Pansexual. So I would hope that they would think we are are a safe person to confide in and tell how they want to do important things like this in their lives.
I will definitely tell them this too. I’m worried about them feeling like they have to label themselves. I just want to know what makes them feel like themselves.
You make a lot of sense. Thank you. I will work on it 🤗🌻
Oh my gosh that is super helpful! Because right now I have been super worried about them because they have been really acting depressed and having big problems with anxiety. It runs in our family to have depression, anxiety, bipolar and other fun stuff so I have an apt with a better therapist than the one they are seeing who works with a psychiatrist. So I could be looking in the wrong direction all together maybe? It could be what your talking about?
I wish more parents reacted the way you are, and I wish I'd had support growing up. Now I'm older and maybe a bit wiser, so I feel like helping folks out that are starting their journey (or supporting those who are) is a little way of being the change I want to see. I'm glad you've found it useful, and I wish you and your kiddo all the best. We're always here for help if you need us.
After reading your post and comments like this I'm positive that your child will get the support they both need and deserve. Thank you for not listening to the rest of your family, you clearly have your head on better than them.
The LGBTIQ+ community tends to be very welcoming and supportive, and there's a special place in our hearts for parents who support their children in exploring, understanding,and living their identities whatever those might be.

Welcome to the fam, fam!
as an nb person, this is a fantastic mindset to see in a parent. i can't speak for everyone, but making an honest effort to get it right and to improve is a lot more than many people do. (i still get my **own** pronouns wrong sometimes after four years using them, so i can hardly expect anyone else to do better!)
as another user pointed out, you're absolutely not offending anyone. You're in the middle of understanding this, no one's expecting you do everything perfectly right without being told how first, so really, you are doing a great job, keep it up!
Don’t feel guilty either because it takes TTIIMMEE for our mouths to follow our brains. My son is trans and it took about 6 months because I called him other pronouns for years. All the support groups and doctors , therapists and queer community folx said the same thing- as long as you keep trying and apologize it will eventually not be an issue anymore. You’ll get there :)
You are a wonderful perant, trying to understand your kid and they're pronouns. That is a marvelous thing. Hope for the best to you and your kid. And try to help them with this  adventure
I'm sharing this tip I got for getting used to a person using a new name or new pronouns, maybe it can help you too.

Have little training conversations with your child or another person if your child doesn't want to. Let them tell you something about them like their hobbies, how they look, what makes them themselves. Repeat those things using your child's pronouns. You can also do this alone by writing down things you know about your child while using they/them or simply repeat it in your mind.
Just here to say you're doing absolutely amazingly! This is a huge thing to process as a parent, and a huge learning curve too. Be gentle with yourself and compassionate to yourself too about how this may take you time to adjust to emotionally.  

The fact that you came here, and everything you're saying just shows how loving you are as a parent, and at the end of the day, no matter what anyone else says, that is by far the most important thing!! You're amazing, keep up the good work, your child will be so grateful to you, and you will be their safe space!

-Sincerely a 24-year-old non-binary psychology and counselling student who wishes that they felt safe at a younger age to talk to their parents about it!!
~~Not me finding out at 16 and I've told 2 ppl...~~
Oh! Thanks 😊
Another very important thing I just thought about:

Do not take your kid slipping up and referring to themself as ""she/her"" or with female terms as ""oh, they've changed their mind again"" because yes, we may accidentally misgender even ourselves, especially when it's still a fresh change.

Instead, if you really get the feeling they may be using those words/pronouns intentionally, check back in with them. They may have changed their mind again, they may still be figuring out which set of pronouns and which reference terms feel best, it may have been accidental slip-ups... It's always safest to keep an open communication instead of assuming.

And yes, with strangers is an excellent place to start practising so that it'll be easier and with fewer slip-ups with people who really count (like your kid, your family, ...)! :D
I wouldn't say it's looking in the wrong direction at all. It's very possible for trans and non-binary people to have those mental disorders, and family history is important to keep in mind. It just would also be helpful to talk to your kid about gender dysphoria, and ask them if they're experiencing any at all, whether it's around their name, pronouns, or body. If you can get a gender therapist in the picture, it would be easier to have that kind of conversation, and also figure out if/how to go about treating it. 

The one thing I'd recommend though is that you don't share it with your relatives if they do say they experience dysphoria. Odds are, your family won't treat them well, which could make things worse. Definitely tell your child that they can talk to you about this and you won't say anything to family or anyone else unless they say they are okay with it. Having that kind of safe space and support can be critical.

Also, I just want to say that it's really awesome that you're putting in the effort to understand them and how to support them better. I can tell you're a great parent.
Thank you I really appreciate you saying that 🤗🤗❤️
Please don't use folx, folks is already gender neutral. It feels preformative and frankly a bit dehumanizing to shove x's in everything to make it sound inclusive. It feels like you're saying we aren't automatically a person included in the language. Ex: humxns could be seen as implying nbs aren't human
I sooo appreciate that because I’m very bad at putting guilt trips on myself.
I absolutely type the x because it’s inclusive of neo pronouns, not to exclude anyone at all. I am non binary too, not just a performative person. Y’all been here a year. You can go they my post history. I’ve spent years as an activist and advocate. I am not performative for trying to as intersectional as possible with a single word. There are trans humanists too, so, sorry…but the x and the word folx is the biggest umbrella term and I am not going to change it because one person is speculating about what others *may* think. There are assholes actually saying we aren’t human now. No need for infighting.
I have a friend whose a mom to trans youth. I’m trying to get used to the terms but she transitioned to he pronouns and changed their name to Finn. I have absolutely no problem with something like this because like my friend I believe it is who you truly are inside “coming out” and it’s very toxic and deadly for you to suppress your true self. It can lead to something as horrible as suicide. So I’m more than ready to support anything my child throws my way I just wanted to understand things better. And have better information to give to my child in her decision and to bring up when people around us are being negative Nellys.
Wow❤️❤️❤️ You have no idea how much this words mean!!! The comfort this community has shared with me is priceless. I feel so capable now! Thank you for lifting me up with your words! I hope to be the best mom possible to my amazing child and hopefully help some lost ones along the way.
Well I Was Just A Couple Months Short Of 16 (Or Maybe A Couple Weeks... Can't Remember The Exact Time.) When I Finally Accepted That There's No Feasible Way I Could Be Cis, If That Counts. And Then Didn't ""Come Out"" Until Almost A Year Later. (I Did Kinda Like Half–Come Out To Some Internet Friends Earlier, But Ehh I Don't Really Feel Like Counting That.)
You're welcome!
Your words of support really do mean more than you know❤️ and I am taking all this advice, not just yours, very seriously. It’s good to have all this information and peoples opinions and insights. Obviously I do not have all the wisdom I need yet but I’m will to “bend” and learn.
Ahh, so happy that I could help!! 🥰♥️♥️♥️
I'm glad! I've seen a lot of great advice on here and it's all things I wish had been said to my family when I was younger. Also, that willingness to learn is so wonderful. :)"	vuj6lt	NonBinary	649	0.97	2022-07-08 19:50:29
Denied top surgery	"Went on my last meeting today where they basically told me that being nonbinary isn’t a thing and that they only treat people that are trans with gender dysphoria. Two years ago they said I’m nonbinary bc I’m obese…. then I lost 15cm in my waistline out of spite. Now they said I’m showing too much progress so I have the ”capability to live with my struggles.” Fuck Sweden. LGBT inclusive my ass lmfao

Also doesn’t help that I’m autistic so they just think I’m being confused.

EDIT; oh gosh, I didn’t really expect to get 40+ comments so this is a bit overwhelming but thank you guys for the support !!

I had been advised by most of my FTM trans friends to lie about my identity but sadly it was a bit too late for that as I was halfway through my meetings. 

The reason I didn’t lie is because after the first meeting, the doctor told me that the gov had gotten more inclusive and included nonbinary people. I had thought to myself: 
”Oh, I’m getting lucky!! Guess there is no need to lie.” 

The meeting I went to yesterday she informed me that.. the gov had removed that right once again. She really wanted to help me but she was simply just not allowed to anymore. The only other organisation that included nonbinary people is across the country and now that has also been limited by the gov.
They’re really just trying to limit us from getting help and being happy.

Next step will be time consuming or money consuming and honestly at this point I’d just want to go the money route despite how limited my wallet is. 

Oh well. I’ll get through this eventually :’)"	"Whattttt so sorry to hear this D: 
Is going private an option for you?
Lie to them I guess?
I'm sorry to hear this.
I also live in a country where they don't recognise non-binary as valid. Didn't even try it here. There's only one gender clinic with 10 years wait.

I'm getting my top surgery next week. Going abroad where you don't need any medical proof, just mutual acceptance. Downside is that you need the money for that. But I couldn't be more excited right now.

Have you looked into this possibility?
Sadly its the same thing in Canada (at least when I got top surgery). Although I do have gender dysphoria, I said I was a trans man because I heard that the surgeons will deny people who are nonbinary from getting top surgery.

I'm so sorry about that. It's not fair.
They thought your gender identity was caused by obesity? 🙄
You ""kids"" are trailblazers! Keep fighting for your right.

I'm 53. I'm nonbinary. I have always wished I could have my boobs removed. They get in the way. Bras are awful, uncomfortable and damaging. I don't use them so why have them?

But for me there was no surgery available because I was born a woman and women have boobs. You ""kids"" have changed all of that. 

Duck that. Push. Fight. Change doctors. You deserve to be the best you that you can be.

I'm proud of you. Good luck.
If you are looking for advice: lie to them

If not, man im so sorry. Its bullshit that they don’t recognize your gender or respect your wishes.
idiots will blame everything on obesity
I'm so sorry to hear this.
 I always thought if there's any country in the world, where enby top surgery would be covered it's sweden.

*Sigh.*

In germany there is the option to flat out lie to all doctors and psychiatrist/psychologists that you are a binary trans* guy (you then still may need a ""good"" reason for not wanting to go on T ; or find a doctors who is accepting and understanding and willing to lie to insurances with you )

Or

You pay for it on your own- most places I've looked into also have options for payment plans- 

I don't know if any of those things are an option for you.

I wish you all the best and hope you'll be able to find a way eventually.
Transphobia and ableism wow.
????? Goofy as hell.

Pull a fast one and just say you're a dude. What're they gonna do, put your boobs back in once they do the surgery?
You would think that they would support nonbinary people since they’re the same country that officially implemented they/them pronouns in their language
Ugh I'm so sorry. Unfortunately when I go to the Dr I have to larp the ""Hello it is me, He/Him super binary man and I love monster trucks and fishing!"" in order to get healthcare. It honestly feels impossible to force them to understand the nuances of gender, so my only advice is to just lie. It sucks but the end result made it worth it for me.
Yeah, Sweden sucks. r/transnord recommends lying about it and saying you're FtM.
🤗 (If you like)
Find a new doctor/therapist.
I feel your pain, I was denied in Germany a few years ago because I naively believed they'd accept non-binary people. I'm so sorry this happened to you.
can you go back and say, ""so after some soulsearching it turns out I'm ftm""? or can you approach a new care organization to start fresh?
I'm so sorry this happened to u

The gatekeeping system is so fucking disgusting in the EU 

This is just institutional oppression, nothing else
Pal, you better lie.
So sorry to hear this and I hope you find another way forward.

Sweden is honestly the most conformist non-affirming place I've ever been to and I'm from Africa.
Hi from Stockholm. I wanted radical reduction because my chest was giving me dysmorphia. I went to Kry to a GP ask about that. And they told me “that kind of things u do privately “.
I told her it’s not the case, that I can be diagnosed and get my surgery. So they put me in a waiting list to a clinic that does it. 2 years waiting time for the first appointment, and then it can take 2 years to be diagnosed. The GP was calling me “transsexual” coz her English wasn’t good and my Swedish isn’t enough to talk about medical issues.

I could have a regular reduction as I qualified but then they would make it just a bit smaller, “proportional to by body”, which I am sure it’s not what I need. Long story short I went privately in Dec…
Feel you 💔❤️
Lie, many Non Binary people to do it to get care. 
I was lucky i didn't need to lie, but about half of my Docters asked if i wasn't just a trans man. Because I'm really masc leaning.
So sorry to hear that.
What the fucking fuck. I’m so sorry. That’s not okay
I'm sorry you're going through this right now!! One of my partners is Swedish and they've expressed having a hard time getting trans health care. The trans healthcare system in Sweden truly seems to be garbage.
Honestly, I would send this info to the news. Read just now in DN about how a tv profile who appears to be nb (använder hen som pronomen men är fem-presenting) apparently had few problems getting breast implants to better conform to their gender. They might have done it through private means, was a long text and don't quite remember, but at least the topic is getting a bit of a spotlight at the moment
I’m so sorry your going through that, I hope something works out soon for you!
Lie. Get what you need.
i shall sprint to sweden and commit murder for you
The fact that I knew this was one of the Scandinavian countries just by reading the first few sentences omg..  
That sounds horribly frustrating and we got a pretty similar situation here in Norway from what I've heard. I'm definitely planning on just telling my doctors that I'm a trans man (technically half-true, so it's fine) because anything else is way too big of a risk. Progressive countries like ours shouldn't be this behind when it comes to trans healthcare. Super frustrating tbh
As a nonbinary person who is also seeking top surgery, this is my biggest fear and I'm so sorry you had to go through that. 
You are valid in your identity, and I urge you to not give up on getting what you need to be comfortable in your body. 
Much love, friend!
I’m just stopping by to show some solidarity. This sucks, it’s wrong of them to deny you this, and I’m sorry that it’s complicating your journey even further.
Gaddam Sweden sure is handing out the backhands for troons today. In another sub a trans girl said they told her she has to be socially transitioned for a year (wearing skirts and makeup out before passing) before they allow her HRT. 

wtf I thought Sweden was like the beat place in the world to live or some shit
Jävla dårar!
That sucks! Exactly the reason I never wanted to transition medically (I'm also in Sweden).
well.. yes.
Em isbitnstill a demand that you get sterilzed before you can under go g""gender affirming care""?
I'm sorry.
it MIGHT be? There is another organisation but its all across the country. it has recently gotten a rule that I need a doctors note that my doctors arent allowed to give bc I’m nonbinary so it’ll be a bit hard
This is, sadly, the way. The amount of times I've needed to lie to doctors due to gender bias is infuriating.
What country are you traveling to?
How much does it cost? Im from the uk and the guidance says they only do top surgery on people who have been on T for 2 years. Im not interested in going on T but have a lot of top dysphoria. Cost for private surgery here is like 10000. Way outta my budget.
Good luck with your surgery btw and let us know how it went!
That's genuinely baffling to me. I'm in the southeastern US and like nobody had an issue (and I'm AFAB and generally femme presenting). Like... its your body and if you want to lob your tatas into the abyss then you should be able to lob your tatas into the abyss.
Wait, they will? :(  
I'm a Canadian enby who has thought about top surgery but never mind, I guess...
Really? I know several non binary people who got their top surgery covered by the Canadian govt in Ontario.
Anti-fatness is the real disease - it makes people act like monsters and treat those in larger bodies as less than human.  Like so what if someone’s fat?! (A word which I use in a neutral sense) If they want to chop their boobs or get any kind of gender affirming surgery, care, joint replacements, etc., why tf are they being denied - I do not buy this utter bullshit about ‘well the anesthesia is harder to do and dangerous and blah blah blah - like no, because you’re happy enough to rush someone into surgery and take their money when it’s a bariatric surgery.  But God forbid fat folks have access to life-improving care of other types.  SMH🫠  Bigotry is so gross.
Can confirm. Everything from my intelligence to my health to my gender to my sexual orientation to my political convictions is somehow caused by and/or invalidated by my weight. It's maddening.
Do you have tips for dealing with the psychiatrist examinations in Germany? I've talked to another guy about this and he said that I won't get their approval bc I'm diagnosed with anxiety disorder and now I'm (ironically) too scared to continue looking for one
Exactly. This makes my future look darker, too be honest
Unfortunately my understanding is that Swedish authorities work hard to shut down all providers that do not conform to their rigid rules. That sucks terribly badly but medical tourism is an option.
Ya
Barcelona, Catalonia. I have surgery with Dr. Brasó
Yeah, it's exactly the same here in Ireland.
In Barcelona you're looking at 5-6k in a good clinic, maybe less if a less known clinic. They're also more used to doing them surgeries over there, so I do trust them more than if I was to get it here.
[deleted]
It really depends where you are in Canada, don't lose hope! The place I went was fine with NB people getting surgery
Not everywhere! I've actually never heard of that, its disappointing to know parts of Canada are less progressive. But, my friend is non-binary, they're not on HRT (they dont plan to transition that way), and they recently got top surgery in Vancouver :) I believe the wait was much less than a year and it cost them like $15 lol (had to pay for anesthetic)
Not everywhere and not every surgeon! Mine was covered by OHIP and this was back in 2017-2018. Things may be different now, but back then I had to lie about being nonbinary.
Oh mine was covered too! I only paid $2000 out of pocket after the OHIP coverage.  


I'm saying moreso that I had to lie that I was a binary trans man (and also that I didn't have any mental health issues) in order to get top surgery. This was back in 2017/2018. Most nonbinary people I talked to had told me to say I was a trans man because many of them were denied for being nonbinary. Others were for being autistic.
My biggest recommendation is going to/calling/email-ing a dedicated counseling for trans*.
They know the local doctors, psychiatrists , etc and frequently deal with health insurance relate trans* issues.

Having other diagnoses does not automatically mean you can't get a diagnosis for dysphoria, being trans*, etc and medial letters and access to at least parts of trans healthcare.

There are people (even frequent psychiatry in-patients with multiple diagnoses) that get at least indication letters and HRT...

Approval for surgeries is in most cases a long and complicated process, often with rejections, for all sorts of reasons (according to my friend who was in contact with a trans counseler in a big city in NRW, she started her process in 2022)
Quite frequently only not accepting the decision of your Krankenkasse and going to court gets the final approval... 

I'm sorry I don't have more details or more positive things to share, I hope it was helpful anyways.
I hope there is some kind of support existing in your area - knowledge about who and what to look for (and what to avoid) can make daunting tasks much less scary.
Thanks a bunch! Gives me some hope for the future.
Oh I’m well aware that I’m one of the lucky people and not everyone can access care. I don’t personally have anyone telling me I can’t do what I’m doing (well nobody with the power to stop me).
This was in Ontario and back in like 2016-2018 for me. It was covered by OHIP for me besides $2000 (to make it 'look nice'). But yeah, things might be different now!  
I just know that prior to my top surgery, I had nonbinary friends who advised me to say I was a binary trans man."	10wcdoi	NonBinary	632	1.0	2023-02-07 20:36:20

Nietzsche destroys transphobia with facts and logic		"I made the mistake of checking the comments under that post
Ok but during my own questioning process, before i realized i didn't have a gender, i searched for definitions of man an woman too. I just wanted to understand, you feel me?
A woman is an adult who identifies as a woman. 

Boom, quick definition
""define woman""

""you first.""

(for real though one of my aha! moments leading to my understanding of myself as nonbinary was my attempt to sort out in my head what makes a woman a woman, and my realization that nothing i could think of was a trait that encompasses ALL and ONLY women, except for a personal internal understanding of oneself as a woman, which I lacked. So in my personal experience, an earnest attempt to define gender is the first step to realizing that gender is a social construct which only matters if we say it does)

Meanwhile I'd Just Try To Find Some Way To Troll The Person Asking.
Woman, a word that’s came from the combinations of wif and Mann, the terms was formed around the last 13th century. (I would continue but it would get far too long… and no I have zero clue if this is right, it’s from Google)
""A woman"" varies on if you're talking about sex or gender. For sex, it's a single person with a XX chromosome. For gender, it's a single person who says she's a woman.
I'm with Eliezer Yudkowsky on [what words are for](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3nxs2WYDGzJbzcLMp/words-as-hidden-inferences) 

What a woman is in the context of wondering whether cyproterone acetate will put a patient at risk for osteoporosis is different from what a woman is in the context of writing a guest list for a girls-only party. If you know all relevant information about a person's physical and mental state and you insist on asking if they're a woman or not, you're [making a predictable mistake](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yA4gF5KrboK2m2Xu7/how-an-algorithm-feels-from-inside) by asking the question, and you ought to teach yourself to do better.
No one check those comments
My day is ruined
Everyone in there should be bullied and be called a nerd
Feel you!

Looking back, I felt silly and stupid for how long it took me to summon up the wikipedia articles on gender in general, and the genders specifically (and afterwards go on a loooong ride through the blogospere) and just take seriously what I got to read there, *and* take seriously the fact that Nothing about either gender resonated with me -- so I must be agendered, right? Then why the hell does my body feel wrong? Why do I get giddy from one presentation, and wear the other like a uniform? 

On definitions, I wish Eliezer's Sequences where more widespread. Nietzsche is a hell of a writer, but he was better at observing than at doing anything with the observations. Came someone to me with the request to define the term 'woman', I would first ask them back: ""For which realm of thought?""
Oh yeah. Definitely me too. Though I was mostly only confused about what a man was since I only really had my mom, grandma, great aunt, and my great aunt's daughter around. 😅 As you can imagine, trying to search what defines a man took me to horrible scary places on the internet. 🤣
The argument I've heard against that is ""you can't use the word itself in the definition of a word"". That's not a valid argument at all, simply using the word doesn't make it a recursive definition, but also the point of ""then what is a woman"" isn't actually seeking a good definition for what a woman is. It's an excuse for transphobia. If you're actually trying to convince someone, discussing the actual root issues would usually be more productive than arguing over pedantic definitions of words.

That said, responding with ""Hmm okay you're right I can't define what a woman is. Please define what a chair is, though"" and then finding an exception to every simple short definition they find is very fun if you're good at finding exceptions like that
They'd just say ""adult human female"". Transphobes deny/don't understand that gender and sex are two different concepts
I have no doubt that you're correct, but the argument presented in the meme is good enough, and it is, in fact, a meme and not a presentation or article on philosophy. I didn't make it; I just thought it would bring some joy to folks.
Even sex is more complicated than that, intersex people prove it.
I would argue almost no one actually uses ""woman"" to refer to sex. Typically the word ""female"" is used in reference to sex. You don't say ""that's a woman dog"" you say ""that's a female dog"", ""this plant is a woman"" vs ""this plant is a female"". Woman is inherently personal and human, not medical and scientific. 

The whole reason the ""DEFINE WOMAN"" is a ""gotcha"" is because who is asking wants the *definition of female* but knows they will get the actual definition of woman which is ""a person who identifies as a woman"". They will bark back essentially saying sex=gender and you try to tell them the difference between sex and gender you will get interrupted and they will say ""SEE HOW COMPLICATED, YOU CANT DEFINE"". 

It's asking a ""simple"" question from bad faith about a complex topic and expecting a kindergarten level answer that's one sentence long.
I mean they all seem like allies, they're just nerding out about their special interest, which is based. The general sentiment seems to be ""Nietzsche would disagree but that's because he's wrong""

Edit: I can't spel
Especially when you consider that one definition of “female” is “woman” which effectively makes their “human adult female” definition equate to “human adult woman” effectively making their definition, “woman = woman.”
Respond with ""what's a female"" and watch them suffer because transphobic people know shit about biology.
I know I glossed over quite a lot to get to that definition. The comment I made is very general, I should have said that in my original comment.
My comment is also very general, I know it's very hard to define man and woman. Some people can identify with their sex, others won't.
I went there and there was comments like ""why should we give the right to self identify with gender"" with 20+ up vote
Omg yes I love this so much

**Your gender identity is not a milestone.**

Posting self-deprecating (and I'm using that term with the conscious choice to give the benefit of the doubt that that's what these posts are about, without intending to be slights or have ulterior motives) posts about how you don't ""qualify"" as nonbinary does, even if you don't intend to, *harm* to everyone else browsing.

Just to list a few ill impacts, intended or not, that these statements end up doing off the top of my head:

* **Shoving people with low self-esteem about themselves under the bus.**

""Am I too ugly to be nonbinary?"", asks a person and posts a selfie, genuinely having the misinterpretation or trauma related to gender issues that you need to be attractive to qualify as your gender.

Meanwhile, another user sees the selfie, believes the person to be more conventionally attractive than they are (*especially* if the person seeing it has qualifications that already make them ""ineligible"" to being seen as beautiful by their cultural beauty standards), and learns the lesson, ""well, if that person is questioning it, then the bar must exist, and I am *certainly* don't qualify.""

* **Othering nonbinaryness.**

""I don't deserve to be called a woman.""

""Am I too ugly to be a man?""

""Am I curvy enough to be a woman?""

Most cis binary people don't ever feel the need to ask these questions. At most, in the context of people who have experiences of being marginalised out of their gender (usually womanhood), but even then, it's usually in the context of ""to be seen as"", and often acknowledged to be the result of societal lenses rather than that 'woman' or 'man' are sacred categories you need to complete labours of Heracles to qualify for.

*So why do we do this to nonbinary people?*

* **Hurting people who have experiences with being marginalised out of their previous identities by subjecting them to similar standards again in their new-found self.**

Yeah, I wasn't done yet. People who have experiences of having seen their AGAB gender as 'conditional' due to ableism, racism, fatphobia, misogyny, et cetera, do not need having those same pressures applied to them now. We managed to accept a wider spectrum of womanhood, a wider spectrum of manhood, now we *need* to get better about not just grabbing those same boxes and applying them to nonbinary people.

* **Equating your transition goals as the right image for being nonbinary.**

Especially us with the goal of ""indiscernible gender"" tend to be faulty of this. I very specifically ask for AFAB nonbinary people to mind how they talk about ""looking nonbinary"" versus ""looking more masculine"". Feminine nonbinary people, and nonbinary people with different bodies deserve to be here also.

Androgyny doesn't equal being nonbinary, and while you're more than allowed to strive for an androgynous appearance, *please* don't equate it to ""looking non-binary"". Especially because...

* **Perpetuating sexism.**

...more often than not, the image of androgyny, as it's seen in the context of stereotypical nonbinaryness, is ""vaguely masculine."" The image of a non-binary body is an AFAB person who has altered their body, which ends up perpetuating not only stereotypes of what being non-binary means, but also equates AMAB bodies as ""neutral"" and AFAB bodies as ""other.""

(Tangentially related: that post about genitalia, while *hopefully* meant to criticise people's expectation of nonbinary people, ended up specifically equating bodies with vulvas as ""sexual and other"", which brought up a lot of righteous anger and shame in especially AFAB people who have already had to deal with a lifetime of being defined as sex toys for consumption.)

**I don't believe any of the people here asking these questions or out-putting these rants are being malicious**, not unless they prove themselves otherwise. **But you do need to be aware of the impact your words have.**

* If you are talking about societal expectations, *state that*, and point your dagger at the people putting those expectations instead of other nonbinary people.
* Separate your personal transition goals from nonbinary as a label.
* Don't equate your dysphoria with the implication that there are standards for being nonbinary.

**TL:DR; Watch for what you imply to be a fact in your speech, because someone more impressionable may take it as one.**"	"Thank you!! I know most of these sorts of posts probably come from a place of insecurity, and looking for confirmation of “yes, you TOO are nonbinary! And enough!” But you totally hit on the unnamed uneasiness I couldn’t explain
I think this also goes for people who are insecure about whether or not they can claim the word trans as a nonbinary person. It's okay to feel however you feel! But how you express that may tell other people that they can't claim that label either
I really like this post because it's goal isn't to shut down important discussions for us to have, but rather to emphasis the need for self awareness and specificity.

That said, I do think it's absolutely important that people who are new to talking about their identities may not understand a lot of the nuance. I lurked for a long time before I started commenting, and I did a lot of external research. But I don't know that it's fair to expect that of people who are in pain and don't have the vocabulary to express it safely.

Not that any of us owe it to be anyone else's therapist, but that it is important that we can speak what we think we feel and hope that someone will be kind enough to share their experience to help give context to our pain.

So yeah, absolutely. We should have this or something very much like it somewhere handy, but I wish there was a sub, a tag, something we could give people where they can spill out what they're feeling and not have people who can't handle that have to stumble across it. Maybe there already is and I just don't see it (I have observation issues sometimes).

Just thinking.
Yes! This needs to be pinned as guidance for all posts here.
I agree with this in principle, but likewise agree with other commenters who have pointed out the very real need to express these feelings, especially among those who understand. For this type of discussion, I would suggest r/NonbinaryTalk. They don’t allow photos (so you will not see any photos asking for affirmations, whether people “pass”, etc) but it is a good place to talk through these emotions and doubts.
Thank you so much. I have seen so many of these posts lately and it has really started to alienate me from this community so I’m so happy someone said something.

I feel like especially the posts that are about AGAB are really reinforcing my feeling that we are only seen as “menlite” or “woman lite” and it’s so distressing. I’m nonbinary. That’s it. I don’t want to be lumped in with people based on my agab, because it isn’t my gender.

Also people asking For woman and afab enby spaces are terfs.
While I see where you're coming from, I also don't think it's as dangerous as you're implying and can actually be helpful overall. It can even be educating and therapeutic in a lot of cases.

You more often than not, almost always really, see someone replying to the self-deprecating person and explaining why they are valid. First of all, you have one person who is going to feel better and feel more valid, and whoever else that feels like that and reads that will feel more valid. It can be extremely positive for people to get validated for more than just that one person.

This post also implies that someone should know better. Often they don't and that's why they made that comment in the first place. This doesn't apply to like ""do I look non-binary"", but more so ""I don't think I deserve to be called non-binary because so-and-so"". They literally don't know better and don't realize that this is not the right way to think about it, so they're not being self-deprecating for the sake of it, but more out of ignorance and probably wouldn't realize this post applies to it. I've said I didn't think I deserved the label trans because I didn't transition in any form. That was my own ignorance, and people told me, no, I don't identify as my AGAB so I can absolutely use that label. This post wouldn't have enlightened me that I shouldn't say that. It was ignorance, not even knowing that it hurts people, just thinking that's the way things are and that label is ""earned"" in a way I hadn't.

I think there's not much usefulness in telling people not to make self-deprecating comments, because often they pop out and feel just like reality to the person, not like self-deprecation. People are legitimately depressed, don't realize they are speaking out of low self-esteem, and have difficult issues with how they look at themselves. You can even end up targeting neurodivergent people who might be in depressed episodes, basically telling them to keep shit to themselves unless they have something positive to say about themselves. Maybe a bit more extreme but it's like, ""you're saying depressing things and making others depressed, you're hurting people by being in pain"". 

Half the ignorant shit I believed about myself, how I didn't deserve so and so, was cleared up by reading comments like these, and when I've seen others make self-deprecating comments I've taken my time to validate them and explain how I felt that way once but here's why it's wrong. Hopefully that person went on to do the same. Just my opinion, I believe it's a very positive thing overall.
👏👏👏
We need to make space for people to express the real emotions of doubt and confusion that come with gender discovery. Such a space did not exist for a very long time (my entire lifetime until maybe 5 years ago, for example), and that forced many generations of people into the closet and into isolation. Suggesting that it is harmful to others to express your true emotions if they are not positive recedes that space, and if this is the only space someone has it shrinks their ability to get the support they need.
I understand all this, and agree, but I think it's fair to say that not very many of us are brimming with self belief.
I want to apologize for the times I have made self-deprecating comments then. Honestly, being told constantly that I look like a man or I don't look feminine at all has just always gotten to me, and it's hurt to the point of making me feel like I'm not good enough to be nonbinary. But you're totally right in that I should be upset at the people who have set those standards for me. I wish society didn't set such harsh gender standards on individuals who don't identify as their AGAB.
Very well said 👏👏👏
*This.*

I’ve been thinking this for awhile, so thank you for putting words to it.
This this this this!!! I’ve felt like I should leave this sub so many times because of the posts you describe, like it can really make me feel uncomfortable and sometimes annoyed when people ask things like “am I too ugly to be this or that” yknow? Coz I know people are insecure, so am I, but implying you have to be conventionally attractive or androgynous in order to be non-binary is a rough thing to see. I’ve fought to be happy how I am coz I’m non-binary no matter what, how you look and present doesn’t change your gender.
I'm really sorry, and will delete my posts accordingly.
👏!!!!!
I think a lot of people making posts like these are confused/scared, or perhaps young.  It's hard to think about how your words affect others when they've merely been part of a train of thought that's been chasing you off the rails for months/years.

But yes, everything you said is true.
This.
Many of us don't have other safe places to express our insecurities, so it's important to be able to do that
I’ll probs get hate for this but I stand by it. This starts because of the obsession with labels. Just be you fuck what others think. I know it’s easier said then done and it took me till I was 23 to properly do so but if you take small steps I can guarantee that realising that only you define you and no one or any label can is hella liberating.
Good post!
Yes
I personally read trans as ""I identify more strongly with the things typically ASSOCIATED with the opposite binary gender of my agab then I do being neutral, bigender, or my agab enough to CONSIDER physically altering my body to match it"". That doesn't fit me but it does fit better with my new nonbinary thinking I've been working on and the trans woman I know that doesn't want to physically transition because she is just not okay with being chemical dependent on hrt and as result last I heard wasn't on hrt.
all of this. i feel so dysphoric when i see posts that focus on agab when agab is completely irrelevant. i wonder if the mods could include a flair for internalized transphobia or something like that? or if there could be a reminder to acknowledge that internalized transphobia/fatphobia/etc is at play???
You make such good points too! Is it possible to feel like I totally agree with you AND OP at the same time? because I do. That’s what makes this whole conversation so interesting, and how nuanced our collective experiences of discovering our nonbinary-ness are.
This
i agree with you, but i don't think you're really contradicting the op, either. i think the point isn't to shut down discussions of doubt and confusion, but to frame doubt and confusion as emotions rather than as facts (maybe not the right word?). for example, instead of saying, ""am i too ugly to be nonbinary?"" one could say, ""i feel too ugly to be nonbinary and i feel invalid because xyz"" and directly ask for reassurance and/or discussion of the societal forces that drive these kinds of insecurities in nonbinary spaces. if that makes sense??? like i definitely want folks to be able to talk about their fears/insecurities etc without actively perpetuating them within the community. i guess it's a fine line, tho, so it does have to be ok on some level for folks to walk it less than perfectly
i think it's also ok to just feel invalid or whatever and straight up ask for reassurance? like for reals, if i see you posting that you're struggling with some internalized enbyphobia or whatever, imma hop in and remind you that you're nonbinary af, you're fantastic, and you make this sub even more awesome than it already was. cuz it's true!
I just want to say I really appreciated your post about gender essentialism, it gave me a lot to think about. Please don't delete it!
I mean that’s ok with how you read it but trans is literally identifying as a gender other than the one you are assigned with birth. It’s fine if it is a label that you don’t want to claim but that’s what it is 🤷
As a transfeminine nonbinary person (trying to find a label -- agender woman?  rofl, who knows or cares!), the ""trans"" label is somewhat difficult for me.  Yeah, I'm on HRT.  But as someone who isn't very feminine at all, I do feel more attached to the ""nonbinary"" label.  I describe myself as ""trans"" to cis people, because it seems to communicate a lot and they can't understand simple gender concepts without their brains overheating.  In the end, to me, labels are about creating a set of expectations for whoever I'm talking to.

I'm not a transmedicalist at all (dysphoria is *certainly* not required to be trans), but the primary motivating factor in me describing myself as ""trans"" and ""woman"" rather than just ""nonbinary"" is the treatment I've received for dysphoria and society's expectations that all lesbians are binary women (and I'm definitely a lesbian).

It's all a big frustrating word game anyway and I commend everyone who hasn't been tricked into playing!
Haha yeah it's just a discussion. I see where OP is coming from. They are coming from a real place and I think it's valid to agree with both of us at some level. It's not like I totally disagree with OP, just feel differently about some aspects.
Thank you so much. This is so sweet. I get afraid of being annoying asking for reassurance, and sometimes I feel ignored when I do ask for reassurance. But I'm glad you're so supportive. Thank you again. :')
I guess it's shifted to that because that fits me being trans neutral, I honestly don't care about sticking with my ""dead gender"" at all anymore, so yours fits better now. 😂
Yah I just had the I guess I'm trans neutral realization so mood. I have what would be called gynecomastia so I guess I already got what I would have taken hrt for so guess that's a thing.
Dang I started developing breast tissue at around 13 before testosterone did me dirty (never got diagnosed with anything though).  I wonder how common that is?
Idk, maybe ask a doctor, I figure mine was related to high Adderall doses I was on but all I really know for sure about it is I still have my tits at 25, about 10% of the majority of case that start in puberty don't go away last I looked at statistics."	qo1leo	NonBinary	610	0.97	2021-11-06 14:39:15
I want to be feminine, but it makes some people uncomfortable.	"I found alot of comments in transgender subreddits,
alot of the post comments or posts in those reddits say they avoid nb people who are feminine or masculine because:
-They get dysphoria
-Don't wanna be seen as gay or straight
-Believe nb people should look androgynous or they're fake cause they're not putting in effort to be labeled correctly. 
It makes me feel a bit sad cause I'm a feminine nb and I don't wanna make someone uncomfortable cause I'm causing dysphoria or making them look fake.. Its making me second guess my identity, I don't wanna make trans people uncomfortable or embarrased."	"Nah that person's just transphobic
Non-binary people can present in any way they're comfortable with, just like any other gender identity, because presentation doesn't define gender, and gender doesn't define presentation.

If a person experiences distressing thoughts and feelings based on seeing you, that's *their* problem, not yours. We are each responsible for our own thoughts and feelings and reactions. If I can *cause* someone to experience dysphoria, that takes away their agency. That means they will be forever at the whims of whoever walks past them for whether they feel happy and valid or not. That's not healthy.

Let's look at a similar case. A woman dresses a particular way to a party. She is sexually assaulted. The perpetrator of that heinous crime doesn't get to say ""she shouldn't have dressed that way if she didn't want to be assaulted."" That's an obviously fallacious argument people make in an effort to try to shift responsibilty for their actions or feelings onto someone else. It doesn't fly with blaming clothing for sexual assault, and it doesn't fly blaming non-binary people for a binary trans person experiencing dysphoria. We call the former victim blaming, and we call the latter trans/enbyphobia. They're the same wrong premise, and both of them should be rejected.

You are valid just the way you are, and interacting with you brings me euphoria. I love seeing the wide variety of ways that non-binary people can express themselves. If you want to dictate someone else's feelings to them, please dictate euphoria in my direction as much as you can by continuing to be awesome.

Edit: please don't give this awards or whatever. I'm flattered, but reddit doesn't need your money. Please donate to the trans lifeline or the trevor project if you can.
tbh someone's dysphoria shouldn't control how YOU express yourself to begin with,,
like yeah they can't control feeling dysphoric and im sorry that gets triggered in some folks but if they're coming onto other people and telling them what to do that's just messed up-
like have they ever considered they could be making someone ELSE dysphoric by doing that? or just straight up invalidating people, like you for instance. It's NOT your fault 

like honestly they should avoid non-binary spaces entirely if they genuinely can't deal w ppl who aren't androgynous and it hurts them THAT much, it gets to a point where you need to take care of yourself- 

bc sure as hell nobody else will be changing their whole body and presentation for them 💀

If they think non-binary ppl can only look ONE way then they already lost the meaning-
like hello?? you can't be putting it into another restrictive box. There's sm non-binary genders and experiences, you CAN'T just slap androgyny on everything.

Be yourself, don't turn away from something that's important to you over someone else's discomfort or even internalized transphobia. It's NOT okay that theyre lashing out or telling people they aren't ""putting in the effort"".
That mindset they are holding is literally so transphobic and toxic. Those under the non binary umbrella do not owe anyone androgyny. Androgyny is not the definition of non binary just like be masculine and feminine don’t decide whether someone is inherently a man or a woman. Do you and wear whatever you want.
It just sounds like transphobia / enbyphobia to me. We come in more types than just 100% androgynous. Anyone who has an issue with it should just get over it, I think.
You dress how you want, your gender identity doesn't equal how femme, masc, or nuetral you are.

If others are being mean to you for being yourself then try to stand up.  I know it's hard to stand up but those people are being transphobic (even if they're trans) and aren't respecting you.

If it really does give them dysphoria then talk to them about it and see how you can both be happy in a situation like that.

I know alot of FTM trans people who love being feminine and wearing dresses and other stuff.  As well as MTF people who don't enjoy being feminine.  How you dress doesn't make you any less NB than anybody else.

I'm Non-binary but I ""act more genderfluid"" because I dress masc, femme, nuetral, and a mix of both depending on how I feel.  (I used to identify as genderfluid but found that I only like they/them and it's my fashion that changes depending on my confidence)


TL;DR : how you dress doesn't mean you're any less NB than any other NB
They’re being transphobic. They have a similar mentality as many cis ppl, the mentality about the binary, so they’re trying to put non-binary people into a third binary when that’s not what being non-binary is about

Do what you want. Do what makes you feel good, and avoid those types of people. Gender identity matters less when it comes to transphobia, anybody can be transphobic in different ways
Other people just existing can't cause dysphoria that's just controlling af. I'm a femme nb too and there's nothing wrong with being femme or masc, presentation isn't gender
Screw them. Be happy being who you are. Your priority in life is you and not worrying about how people might be uncomfortable because of their own issues. You be you 🤛
Honestly that’s such a stupid argument. What, you’re (general) a trans man and you get dysphoric when you see a trans woman? That’s fucking gross? Why’s it different for nonbinary people? There’s no one way to be nonbinary (or to be binary trans either ok) and so you being feminine IS a part of your gender. That’d be like you going up to a trans guy and going “you’re masculine and that gives me dysphoria bc I’m feminine, can you stop?” Like that’s crazy. I’m sorry you see that stuff
Sadly there are a lot of transphobic trans people...

They are not right, you can look how ever you want. We don't owe anyone androgyny.
And them getting dysphoria of you or others is not your problem, it's their own because this is something we can't look after. Your freedom and rights weigh the same as theirs.
If having a style you enjoy ""makes someone uncomfortable"". Let them be uncomfortable, you don't owe people androgeny. Anyone can be feminine regardless of gender.
Not conforming to an idea is the expression of non binary imo. It means I’m gonna go for what makes me comfortable and happy without an idea of what I “should” be looking like.
Yo, do whatever the fuck you want. It's not your job to make other people feel comfortable, it's your job to make you feel comfortable. Anybody who looks at someone else and is uncomfortable by it, it's their job to either ignore it or look at themselves and see why they're being a bigoted asshole. Doesn't matter who they are. Trans. Cis. Straight. Gay. Bi. Progressive. Conservative. Etc. Etc. Do what YOU want.
Enby people come in all shapes and sizes.

I present feminine in society eyes but personally I think I give off more neutral vibe.

If 1 word cannot define all people in a gender, then why should an enby present a certain way.

Never doubt yourself bb ❤
You can't control other people's thoughts. Present how you want
>They get dysphoria

That's frankly not your problem. Some people get dysphoria from seeing their deadname. Doesn't mean they can forbid anyone with that name to use it any more. If you're a femby, that's who you are.

>Believe nb people should look androgynous

We don't owe androgyny to anyone. Clothes and style aren't inherently gendered, it's just shit we made up. If men can enjoy wearing frilly dresses, so can enbies.

>they're not putting in effort to be labeled correctly.

That's just transmedicalist bs. If you're fine with being mislabelled, it must mean you're not dysphoric, which means you're not trans/enby. It's gatekeeping, nothing else.

>I don't wanna make someone uncomfortable

You'll always make someone uncomfortable over benign stuff. Doesn't mean you have to give them control over you. Someone will always want you to be different. But it's an unreasonable demand. If you give someone dysphoria just by existing, it can't be helped. Some *other* trans person will feel dysphoric over your most androgynous look. It just happens. But you can't turn invisible.

Plenty of trans people will have 0 issues with you doing your thing. I know my friends would, bc they've always been supportive of me, and I'm pretty femby myself.
[deleted]
You’re valid no matter what you wear ❤️ Clothes/aesthetics have no gender
[deleted]
Making other people comfortable with your presentation isn't your job (with a few obvious exceptions). Your presentation is to satisfy your own feelings about gender, not to kowtow to archaic and transphobic attitudes. And even fellow queers—even fellow *enbys*—can be transphobic, sometimes without even realizing it.

It is impossible to prevent oneself from making other people uncomfortable, regardless of what you do, regardless of what it relates to. Reconciling with this fact is one of the key lessons of maturity.

If the people you are concerned about are your friends, ask them openly how they feel. If they're truly your friends, they'll try to work with you on the issue. If they're random people on the Internet, fuck 'em (metaphorically). Their part in your life is insignificant unless you make it significant.

Unless you have reason to believe that your preferred presentation would put you in danger or at great financial disadvantage, you can generally not worry about how other people react. It's not their life to live.
I'm an androgenous enby with a lot of dysphoria, and I'm here to say: no matter how you present, what pronouns you use (including exclusively using he/him or exclusively she/her or exclusively using neos), how much dysphoria or lack thereof you have, and what other people think - you are valid and whoever doesn't like it has to deal with their own feelings
Hi! This is called internalized transmisogyny, they're projecting their own dysphoria on you, and how other people have made them feel at other times in their lives. Also no one gets to police anyone else's gender, that's the whole point of gender identity. You are valid however you feel comfortable. I hope this helps. 💕
there seems to be an uptick in enby-phobia lately i wonder what 4chan operation is going on?
I don’t give a fuck if my enbyness makes *anyone* uncomfortable.  Sure, if I’m being an asshole, by all means, tell me; the last thing I actually want to do is make people uncomfortable.  That said, however I present is MY business, not theirs, and if me looking feminine or masculine bothers them, they can eff right off.  I hope you can appreciate how important it is to dress and present the way *you* want to.  So yeah, mute that noise and do what makes you feel good, not strive to avoid making someone uncomfortable with your presentation.
You don’t want to be feminine, you *are* such a beautiful feminine individual that identifies nb and living your true colors, loving every aspect of it, will make YOU comfortable. And that’s all it matters. Fuck everyone else. Sending fem hugs to you! 🏳️‍⚧️
Fuck that.

You want to express your gender in a feminine way, fuck anyone else that gets uncomfortable by that. It's not your fault nor your problem. Especially if they set these dumb ass rules up and expect each and every person to be like ""Oh you know what, that actually makes sense."" 

In my opinion, and you can decide to do what ever you want. But I say express yourself however you want, be safe & stop letting these randoms that would throw you under the bus in a heart beat dictate how you feel on a day to day bases.
It's not your responsibility to deal with other people's internalized transphobia. You could present as masculine or as feminine as you want, and you still deserve to be treated with respect and not be misgendered. Even trans people are capable of being wrong, and it sounds like you ran into some truscummy types. They don't get to tell you how to present, nobody does. You are allowed to do what makes YOU most comfortable. Don't center other people's feelings in your gender identity
Dont listen to truscum, just keep on being you :)
What is it with like some members of the binary trans community being all truscum about nbs. I get theres like a phenomenon where they're kind of projecting their insecurities trying to cope but like tearing other people down is so unintuitive. We're all in this struggle together smh
Trans people can be transphobic. Black people can be racist. Gay people can be homophobic. 

Discrimination knows no boundaries, but if you want to counteract that, be the change you want to see.
Feminine enby here :3

I love going out wearing my dresses or skirts and doing my make up a little ( I am not good at it) 

No one can tell me to fuck of about my gender ^ ^
Fuck them. They need to work on their own internalised transphobia, not try to shame other people for how they present!
Dysphoria is an involuntary response, like as a transfem person I sometimes feel dysphoria looking at other people: either because they look like I want to look or because they remind me of myself in a bad way. However, that's not your problem! I don't choose what I have dysphoria over and sometimes that is annoying *for me* but I get through it and it doesn't impact my ability to befriend people who give me this feeling.
Don't listen to these people - be your amazing feminine nb self, and don't care about people who're not okay with this. If these people gatekeep your identity based on your presentation, I feel like they themselves don't have much of an idea of what identity means. Non-binary doesn't imply androgynous, and androgynous doesn't imply non-binary either!
 who tf cares, you can dress/present yourself however you want, if someone has a problem with it, that’s not a person worth your time
fuck the other people, you present how you would like to, if they’re uncomfortable then that’s their own problem
Binary trans people who put down nonbinary trans people are transphobic. This is one of those ways that trans people can be transphobic. 

Also if someone is dysphoric around me because my gender shifts around between ""she/her but in a drag way"" and ""he/him but in a lesbian way"" (im nonbinary fluid) then that is on them to unpack. I am not going to sanitize myself for other trans people??? Thats the same thing that cis people demand of them and of us, sanitizing their identity for respectability politics. They just have it easier than GNC folk, even binary people have the right to present outside of gender norms

Edit: typo and phrasing
You should do whatever makes you happy. If someone tells you that you’re causing them dysphoria, then that’s something they need to work out, and stop hating on non-binary people. Non-binary literally means not being part of the binary, so you are free to present however you feel comfortable. Don’t let anybody take that away from you, okay? Don’t surround yourself with people like that, because not every lgbtq+ person is nice.
You do not owe anyone androgyny. I'm AFAB and often femme presenting, I'm still nonbinary.
their bullshit is not more important than your truth. if you feel limited in your expression by others in the lgbtq community you havent failed us - we have failed you. do whatever the hell you want
Women don’t have to be femme, men don’t have to be masc, we don’t have to be andro.

Widening gender freedom helps ALL trans people, binary or not
No that’s genuinely non-binary-phobia at work. You have the right to express however the fuck you feel. Be feminine, be masculine, whatever works for you. You don’t need to conform yourself to others views of gender.
Just say fuck them and be who you want to be
Sometimes you gotta do you, other people may be uncomfortable (regardless of where they reside on hetero/queer/nonbinary-ness) to just be you, be happy with you and do you, sometimes we have to stop wprrying what others thing and care more about what we ourselves think about ourselves.
Just jumping in quickly to state that “nb” actually stands for “non-black” and should be reserved for those in our BIPOC communities for those who it is relevant to, rather than nonbinary communities. 

Some available alternatives are; enby and nBi 😊 
Not having a go at anyone, just trying to help educate and raise awareness as a fellow enby 😊 

Also OP, fuck what other people think, at the end of the day it’s your body and it’s your choice. Nonbinary doesn’t have any one single “look”, fuck anyone who says otherwise. You wanna be feminine? Well then babe go get it, be the most gorgeous person out there, you are still 100% valid. You got this xx

Look up Kate Bornstein she was a femme presenting non-binary person before most of us were conceived. Such an inspiration!
Be how you want to be
Do whatever the help you want,  the opinions of people on the internet don't matter unless you let them matter
I thought you were going to say transphobes were uncomfortable. There is some difference between what you are actually talking about, but not as much as those NBphobes would probably like to imagine.
Their thinking is garbage and seems extremely shallow.  I wouldn't want to be around people who had such feelings, so we could mutually avoid each other.  It sounds like they have small minds lol

I can go from masculine to feminine and back again several times through the day/week/year.  It's taken me so long to be okay with my fluidity, I'm not about to shut down parts of me for some random person I don't even know.  If it makes them that uncomfortable, they can look away.  We all have a right to exist as ourselves, and express our gender however makes us feel most comfortable.

I used to be afraid to look ""too"" feminine or masculine when going out.  I didn't want attention either way.  Random people out in the world don't know I'm non-binary, but I get very different reactions from others based on how I'm presenting that day.  I fear being oggled and sexualized if I dress too feminine, and appearing obviously genderqueer in hostile situations if I dress masculine enough.  I'm starting to realize that it's not my responsibility if other people have a reaction to me.  I still try to be safe, and will dress more neutrally if I'm going into a place that I think is going to be dangerous, but I've started to let myself just exist and take up more space when dressing for work or just going about my life, for instance.

No one has any valid reason to go around policing someone's gender identity or expression, and it's inherently sexist and transphobic to do so.  How would these people feel if someone else made up arbitrary, nonsensical rules about how they could present?  It's also not our job to convince anyone else that we're not ""fake"".  Being masculine or feminine doesn't determine your gender identity, and it's 100% valid to be feminine non-binary, regardless of your agab.
i feel the same way. i’m non-binary and i’m also afab and i feel like i’m constantly being sexualized whenever i try and embrace femininity. i’m also MORTIFIED of making anyone uncomfortable.

i think it’s important to remember that femininity doesn’t rely on your genitalia! i love being feminine!!! and i love mainly presenting masculine too. you’re so so sooooo valid. it’s hard to remember that sometimes. you’re beautiful even if you don’t think so!!! don’t feel embarrassed because you’re not alone! trans include non-binary people too.
You do you and don't let anyone else's opinions affect you
I am nonbinary. I also wear dresses and makeup and have long hair. Those two things can and do coexist. You are no less nonbinary if you dress masc or fem than if you dress andro. The way you dress or present yourself has absolutely nothing to do with your gender identity even though most people think it does. A straight cis man can wear a dress and still be straight and cis right? You can dress feminine and still be nonbinary. Anyone who believes otherwise is wrong. If you wanna talk about this more feel free to message me. Never stop being who you are ❤️
okay and? you’re gonna let people depict your happiness? fuck them.
If they are also being rough on anyone mtf then those are terfs, just mute those people they aren't worth dealing with.
You present yourself how you want to. Don't care what others think of you. You do what makes you happy. If presenting fem makes you happy present fem. If presenting masc makes you happy, present masc. Those other people saying that if your nb you have to present androgynous, are just being transphobic jerks, (even if they are trans themselves).
You don't owe anyone androgyny
It's such a shame that people who go through so much difficulty and hostility turn it on each other so often. We need to support one another!
Remember there no one/proper way to be non-binary. There is no specific look you have to have.
Sorry I believe I wrote it wrong, its multiple people who are trans.
This is a beautiful response.

Nothing I can say will top this.
AGREED
>so they’re trying to put non-binary people into a third binary when that’s not what being non-binary is about

It's rather ironic how the same community that is so opposed to being forced into a gender binary turns around and imposes their own gender binary of cis/trans upon all people. And anyone that attempts to opt out of that binary, or dares to question its efficacy, will face harsh ridicule and mockery. Last month I even had a nonbinary person come into my subreddit and tell me (very condescendingly) that I should just accept being ""cis"" gender nonconforming right on a post where I expressly disavowed being called ""cis"".
And as for that last sentence, “I don’t wanna make trans people uncomfortable or embarrassed” I don’t know your relationship with your gender, but. Nonbinary people ARE trans people. So why should you, a trans person, make yourself uncomfortable just for the comfort of another trans person who is being gross and judgemental?
Yep!!! Personal boundaries are important.
Lunarian, yay!  I'm so happy to see someone using the galactian alignments system in conversation.

The system resonates with me, too.  I think I'm probably eclipsian or galaxian.  I would feel very constrained and uncomfortable limiting myself to pure androgyny at all times.
Don't use that word except to refer to yourself.
 If a gay man doesn't like lesbians because they're lesbains, it makes them homophobic. If a trans person doesn't like another trans person because they aren't ""looking"" the part, they are being transphobic.
Transphobia can occur even within transgender circles, friend.
being trans and being transphobic are not mutually exclusive :)
I was deadnamed and misgendered by a binary trans woman. I'm a transfemme nonbinary woman. If anyone thinks I'm doing my gender wrong, I try my best to not take it personally. They are either a transphobe, a misogynist, or both.
You looking like yourself isn't supposed to cause any dysphoria as it is your body. You're not fake, I'm a transmasc enby but I still dress feminine a lot because I like it. Looks =/= gender
My friend, it seems like you stumbled upon truscums. They're a subset in the trans & non-binary community (although sometimes the cis join them) that basically dedicate themselves to enforce a closed, outdated and rigid definition of what being ""truly"" trans is.

Some of them don't even acknowledge the existence of enby folks, whereas others accept us but tell us shite like that, that we need to achieve androgyny in order to be ""truly"" enbies...

Bullshit, all of it. If you feel great being feminine, I say become fucking Aphrodite if you want! They aren't entitled to dictate how \*you\* should feel and present. You're the only one whose opinion matters here, since \*you\* are the one living in your own skin.

Besides, their claims are nonsensical. Dysphoria doesn't work like that??? How the hell do you get dysphoric at ""masc or fem presenting enbies""??? Doesn't make any sense, they're straight up lying.

Being fem is absolutely harmless. If they get uncomfortable at it, it's a \*them\* issue, not yours. I encourage you to follow what makes you feel full and dismiss ill-intentioned claims such as these.
It’s just outright hypocritical. I support whatever gender ppl identity as, I support you for being gender noncomforming(although tbh I don’t fully understand that, I’m still learning things)

What ppl identity with has no effect on me, and I see no reason to put others down for it

It’s like they only expect cis ppl to not be transphobic, they don’t hold themselves to the same standards
[deleted]
No better example of that than Caitlin Jenner
>enforce a closed, outdated and rigid definition of what being ""truly"" trans is.

That's not true at all. It is actually the reverse. The *new* definition of ""trans"" is what is closed and rigid since it only allows for people that claim a ""gender identity"" to be part of the community. Transgender was originally conceived in the 1990s as a broadly inclusive umbrella for anyone that was marginalized for breaking the social rules of gender regardless of identity or expression whether it be drag queens, crossdressers, transsexuals, genderqueers, butches, femmes, etc.
Of course non trasphobia is achievable. You wouldn't say no one is truly not misogynistic just because certain women push a patriarchal view of femininity or something. Doesn't make sense.
bro literally the only other posts in your history are questioning the validity of nonbinary identities and you want to come in here arguing about what defines ""true transphobia"" lmfao
Truscums aren't exactly a new thing so it's still outdated. You deliver a great point, though, by pointing out what it was defined like at the beggining :)
[deleted]
Keep in mind that Trans-medicalists also don't represent the broad consensus of the trans community. They are a fringe group, not unlike the relationship of TERFs to feminism. The definition they cite isn't confirmed by any major medical journals, encyclopedias, or other reputable sources.
You’re literally just typing words to type them. None of this makes any sense. Hot garbage.
Ehm circumcision deff aint pointless i needed to get that done when i was 3 because of medical reasons (that i dont remember i was 3 xD)
I understand your sentiment. It's really a fight of nomenclatures here. Provides no one anything.
[deleted]
I think it really depends on context. Circumcision for medical reasons, such as the example you gave, are generally fine and understandable. Circumcising a baby that just came out of the womb on the other hand, not so understandable and, to put it mildly, pointless. At least that's how I view and understand it.
How is it stretching the definition? If you're saying a trans person can't present a certain way because of how you personally understand their identity, that is transphobic, because they understand their own identity better than anybody and it's literally none of your business. Prejudice targeted against trans people and their identity is the very definition of transphobia. 


It just sounds like you don't really understand nonbinary identity all that well, which, given that you made a post on r/tooafraidtoask wondering what is even is, doesn't really surprise me.
Really feels like you’ve missed the point so I’m not trying to be rude I just wanna spell it out plainly that a feminine non-binary person existing is neither rude or transphobic. But if you’ve got a problem with any non-binary person existing & presenting as themselves, or if you try to make their identity about you, then that’s pretty much rude AND transphobic. Whether it’s said by a cis person or trans person. Live and let live right?
Yeah, there are a lot of factors worth considering for *any* infant surgery. Pediatricians used to think [circumcision](https://www.ghspjournal.org/content/5/1/15) [prevented cancer](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10699138/), but newer research suggests that [other variables may make the difference ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1758146/pdf/v074p00368.pdf). Basically, circumcision might be like[ tonsillectomies](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C28&q=tonsillectomies+overused&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DuMuK5eP40eYJ), which are really beneficial in some cases but were overused for awhile.

Either way, the whole topic tends to be a magnet for antisemites 😅
[deleted]
Oh yeah, I mean it's not a topic I'm hugely familiar with in the first place, but I can imagine how many antisemites and reactionary chuds flock to it the way middle aged British white women flock to a Simply Red concert.
OK. What labels are you referring to specifically that seem unnecessary to you?
[deleted]
Transphobic isn't a label, though. It's a descriptor, more than anything. Also, no offense, but you don't get to decide what is and isn't offensive to a particular group of people. If they say it's offensive (or in this case, transphobic) to them, then it is. I really don't get why you're arguing this. /gen /nm
[deleted]
Does it matter? Either way, it's not a contest to see who's the most/least upset at something. The important thing is to actually listen to people and understand why they (be it on an individual or collective level) find certain things upsetting in the first place, instead of holding these rather pointless discussions about where we ""draw the line"". Again, if you're not part of a particular community, you don't get to say what is and isn't offensive to said community. /gen /mn"	qrw8m4	NonBinary	598	1.0	2021-11-11 22:03:30
Am I justified in wanting to cut off a friendship with someone I've known for 4+ years because he 1) purposefully misgenders me after I've asked him multiple times and 2) constantly disregards my identity?		"I do not believe the length of a relationship has any bearing on its quality. You may have had your arm for your whole life, but if it is gangrenous it must be severed.
You are always justified in choosing who you want in your inner circle. This applies to friends, but also to family.
You're always justified cutting off people who refuse to accept and respect you, no matter who it is or how long you've known them.
Yes just yes
Someone who doesn't respect you isn't really a friend.
You don’t need to justify ending a friendship. If it’s not working for you that’s absolutely fine. You don’t owe people your friendship or time!
Yes, they are telling you they're no longer your friend. Listen and walk away.
Yes. If this person is intentionally disrespecting your identity, then they don't respect you.

You don't owe your friendship to someone that doesn't respect you.
Yeah, just because youve been friends in the past doesn’t mean he’s not actively treating you like shit now. Cut him out, he clearly doesn’t respect you and you don’t deserve to be sitting here questioning whether or not you should put up with that level or disrespect. Drop him
Just in case you needed any more validation: YES, you are most definitely justified in cutting out people from your life who are hurtful and harmful, no matter how long you’ve known them.
Yeah, I recently cut off a friend I've known since 2015 because of their transphobia.
Hell yes. If he doesn’t respect who you are, he isn’t a friend
Yes, that’s not a friend
Yes. Apparently this person doesn't care about you, and is only in the relationship because of what he gets from it. Don't waste your time begging people to care about you, it isn't worth it.
100% justified
I mean that's why I stopped talking to my entire family. I don't care how long you've known them. If they can't accept you, fuck it you don't need them
You can cut off a friendship for any reason or none at any time. You have no obligation to be anyone's friend.

Also, let's be clear, this person is absolutely not your friend. They are a bad person masquerading as your friend. A real friend respects and loves you for who you are and who you want to be, and would never purposefully torment you like this.
The same thing happened to me in November - one of my mates constantly dissreguarded my gender and constantly refused to accept my pronouns. Due to an escalated event with them, I have not spoken to them since. It is most certainly justified.
Yes, you are fully justified. They're constantly and willfully insulting you.
Throw the whole man away.
100% yes 

If you asked me if you are justified in punching him in the fucking throat, also yes 

Buut if you asked if you were justified in giving him a swift kick to the gonads…. Mmmm…. Lol jk still yes. Kick him in the balls.
I’m gonna take the less popular opinion. If you’ve known them for four plus years and just now started to change your gender, your friend might just be unable to shake the habit or doesn’t see it as a big enough deal in their mind. It’s a problem but it’s up to you if it’s a friendship ending problem or a you just need to be more assertive with them problem.
If you've known him for 4+ years and he doesn't respect your identity,, that's not a good friend.
Start misgendering him. Or just leave, you don't have to stay
Fuck em. My ex best friend threw a 6 year friendship down the drain by deadnaming me because I called her out for not showing up to work. Cis people who keep that in their back pocket are pathetic bigots and its always over the prettiest shit. He'll keep doing it if he knows it works.

I dont have friends except my partner since coming out and its still better than friends like that.
Yes
They seem to want to be friends with a version of you that isn't there anymore, and maybe never was, so that whole long friendship might have been a misunderstanding in the first place.
yes
Yes
They are not entitled to your friendship or to be in your life no matter the length of time or what they have ‘given’ you during the time of knowing them. If they do not respect and/or accept who you are, they do not deserve to be in your life. Period. It is completely justified to cut someone off if they continuously overstep your boundaries and disregard who you are. It’s not only good to cut out toxic people to better your quality of life and have better friends, but it also helps build confidence in yourself for standing up for who you are and enforcing boundaries creates a better relationship with yourself. If I let people walk all over my boundaries, not only are they disrespecting me but I’m disrespecting myself. Cut them out of your life! You deserve it.
Yes yes yes how can you be a good friend to someone who doesn’t even make an effort to see you how you see yourself?
Save yourself the pain and don't talk to him anymore if he really isn't assed to respect you :(
Don't worry about whether a reason is ""justified"" or not. If you don't feel safe and respected in a relationship, that's more than enough to cut it off. You deserve people that make you feel good to be around :)
You very much are
>Am I justified in wanting to cut off a friendship with someone

yep!

>because he 1) purposefully misgenders me after I've asked him multiple times

doesn't sound like a friend to me, then
I cut off years-long friendships because people were racist or homophobic when that bigotry wasn't directed toward me.

You are completely justified with cutting off a friendship with someone who won't respect you or your identity.
Absolutely
yes
What would you say to another trans person in your situation?
We are allowed to set boundaries with people, and anyone who is willing to hurt you like that does not value your time and friendship like they should. 
The world is harsh as fuck, we don’t need to further subject ourselves to any extra abuse or invalidate ourselves for the sake of anyone else’s comfort. 
Continuing your friendship let’s him know that it’s an acceptable way to treat YOU and any other trans person that has the misfortune of interacting with him. 
Be kind to yourself, you deserve better 💗
Yes
Yes. You are fully justified.

We get to choose to have people who respect us in our lives.
Block that toxic misogyny out of your life. NO ONE has the right to disrespect you as a human, no matter the relationship.
Yes. I was in a similar situation recently, and at the end of the day, I didn’t feel safe or comfortable to be myself around them, and that wasn’t okay.
of course you are, why should you be a friend with someone who is so ignorant and a bigot to you
Yeah I think ya are
RESPECT- if they use the wrong pronouns they are disrespecting you. relationships of any kind need respect
Yes. It is your life. You choose who gets to be part of it. 'Friends' family, anyone who doesn't treat you with the basic common respect you deserve, can go.


Blood ain't thicker than piece of mind.
Uhhh

Yea
yes
Not at all I ended 20 year friendship because the person flat out refused to ever use or acepet that my name was changed ""nope I will always call you deadname"". Bye to anyone who dose that on purpose my friends still mess up on name sometimes quick correct and move one the way it should be.
Without question
the biggest mistake i have made in friendship is thinking that just because it's been forever means it has to keep being forever
Do you honest think any of us here would tell you to tolerate blatant disrespect like this ?!
Yup you don't have to remain friends with anyone especially if they are disrespecting you
YES
You are the gate keeper.  
You chose who you let into your life.
Do not compromise.

In the long term, 4 years is nothing.
He clearly does not respect you.
Cut toxic people out of your life.
yes
You don’t need to justify not continuing a relationship with someone. If you don’t want to continue to be their friend you don’t have to continue to be their friend. No one is entitled to access to you.
If he was willing to keep a healthy relationship with you, he would gender you properly. If you think it's right go for it and cut it off.
Yes, perfectly justified. He does not respect you, why would you want to be friends with someone like that?
For me friendship requires respect and healthy communication. I would never presume to tell you what to do, however for me if I felt disrespected like that I would have to limit my interaction or terminate the relationship. 

Those who judge don't matter and those who matter don't judge
You don't need justification to cut off a friend. If you want to cut off a friend, then go ahead.
trust me cut them off ( it was the best thing i ever done).
Listen: it’s not going to be easy. It will hurt. Trust me when I tell you it’s worth it. 

I used to live with a group of friends that I knew for about 6 years and lived with for about 3. We were very close. I considered them family. We cried and laughed together. They were my people. Then I came out as nonbinary. For about a year I lived with the constant misgendering. “It’s hard to remember,” and a million other excuses. So I drew a line. Two days later they taped an eviction notice to my bedroom door. 

One year later, I don’t know anything about them, and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. It will be worth it.
yes
There is no point in keeping somebody around who does not want to respect you.

  It is a toxic situation and will eventually bring you down.
You deserve better. Time to move on.
Yep. You have the right to cut anyone who fucks with your zen.
Yes, filter out any toxicity that you can, It has no place in your life.
You beautiful child... that ""friend"" is not a friend. A friend is someone who supports you and cares about you, the real you, not demands you be their idea of you who never was.

(I'm pretty sure this is basically a repeat of every comment here, but it demands repeating)
It really depends on how much you value the other parts of your friendship. I've definitely had friends who don't understand, but because they're very dear to me I take extra time to try and get them to understand how important it is to me and get them used to it. But if you find that the exhaustion or disappointment outweighs the other parts than you have no obligation to entertain them further.
My friend of 11+ years and her husband (friend of 10+ years) still don't acknowledge my transition on a normal bases. I don't know they've ever used my pronouns (they/them).

That being said I'm not expecting them to pick it up anytime soon. They also tease me about my pronouns on rare occasions and when they do I know they are coping with watching a friend change and come out their shell.

Sometimes people are worth forgiving
Yeah

Tell him that too

Go up to him, stand proud, and 

“Hey. We’ve been friends for a while, and I value our relationship. But, it’s clear you don’t. You are constantly misgendering me, my gender or pronouns are not up for debate or a request. You are going to start using them, or I can’t have you in my life. You need to decide if you value our friendship or going a little out of your way to wrap your head around a new concept more.”
Yes. Sounds like a shitty friend
You are definitely justified in cutting ties with people who deliberately disrespect you
You are more than justified. It's scary, yes, but I did the same thing with a ""friend"" I've known since freshman year to the very end of high school who was always toxic and actually yelled at me when I corrected my pronouns once during my own graduation party and said ""Look, I've always seen you as a girl, just accept it.""
You'd be justified in cutting off a friendship that just wasn't interesting. This is hanging out with someone who actively disrespects you. No need to feel bad at all.
Are you justified because he disrespects you? Absolutely. Anytime someone refuses to accept your boundary is disrespect and you need to enforce that boundary. You deserve people around you that respect you.
Yes
Yes, 100%
Do it. You’ll feel so much better
I’ve had shitty people end relationships on a lot less, so a genuine person like you should be alright to end it with valid reasons.
Idk about others but you have my blessing, cut that a-hole off and never look back 🙌
absolutely, he sounds like an ass
that guy can go fuck him self
Absolutely, if someone who you've known for a long time purposely doesn't try make you feel comfortable as yourself, especially if they do it over and over again,  you are fully justified to cut the relationship.
yes. i’ve done it. it’s not worth putting yourself through that just because “i’ve known them for so long”
Yes you are absolutely justified, a person like that holds no respect or regard towards you and your feelings. No one needs that kinda stinky in their life, you deserve better
yes
Yes you are justified. I cut off a friendship just a couple of weeks ago from a friend of 5 years because he wouldn't stop calling me derogetory words for being a femboy
If he does this to you after you've asked him to stop just cut him off. I had to do this to a friend, though we haven't known each other as long. We still kinda (almost never) talk. I just hope things get better for you.
Anyone who purposefully misgenders you isn’t worth keeping as a friend
You are absolutely and completely justified
I personally have never had patience for this when I've told them and givin ample time to adjust to what I've told them. It's like having someone close to you refer to you as ""It"". If your not important enough in their life, to where even the smallest form of respect can't be afforded to you, then I can't see how it's not justified.
Yes, without question. The 4+ years doesn't matter if this person doesn't respect you.
they do not value you as a person if they cannot respect your identity. how could he ever value your friendship if he cant even give you basic human respect? ✂️cut em off✂️
I’m definitely using this metaphor later, if you don’t mind.
Perfectly said. 
Also my brain said 
Me to my right arm* "" better not join any gangs or I'll to chop you right off.""
The classic metaphor, yea pretty much
Especially to family.
Exactly. I would have saved myself years of pain and stress if I had cut out a couple toxic people much sooner.
lmao...made me actually laugh out loud to the ""punching him in the fucking throat"" part
I've actually started transitioning in the past two years, but I came out to them and my other friends three years ago. I passed it off as adjusting, but he's gotten more aggressive lately.
Probs not the most trans friendly way to do it, but tbh this might actually help get some people to understand how it feels
Go right ahead.
Okay, I’m in favor of the popular opinion now 😂😅 I think you deserve better than that. I’ve cut off a toxic friend before. Just stop communicating with them.
I'm usually only for retaliation for empathy. This is what I do to my Narcissistic parents and it works more than not. And when it doesn't, walk away, they don't want to learn
Can you elaborate?

Edit: in the process of probably cutting my mom out of my life right now (it's her call if she'll go to joint therapy with me) cause she doesn't talk like she respects me, and can't see how the things she says are rude. I suspect my mom is narcissistic too.
When my mom would do some petty like trying to force food she hates into meals, I would do it to her. Of course, she would complain, and my response would be ""Oh yeah, I hate when people do that to me."" Shocked pikachu face. It took a while, but she realized I would respond in kind to whatever she said. I forced empathy on her. She still tried things on occasion, like she is testing to see if I dropped my guard, but it never works. I can *not* say it would work for you, but it's a good way to test how they react to their boundaries pushed."	skgwp3	NonBinary	594	1.0	2022-02-04 16:06:24

Ahhh! How did I miss this one?? You're so heckin adorable! 🤩 I love this look on you so much! 💙
Thanks 😊 I've try my best to find things that could match with my ""normal"" wardrobe!
Thanks☺
Thanks 😍 I really love how my body is androgynous
Our identities are brautiful🖤
Thanks ☺
Thanks☺
Thanks☺
Thanks ☺
I feel the same way about mine hahaha like i feel i'll look more androgynous if i shave but I don't really want to
Ahhh thanks, you make me blush real hard right now☺☺☺
I'm envious xD I hope I can get there. Hope to see more outfits of yours on here, because this one is cute and you have great fashion sense\~
At this point for me I'm honestly afraid to shave lol. I've had this beard since my freshman year of college. I legitimately don't know what my face looks like without it anymore.
I'm sure you can get there! And you will probably see some others soon enough ;)
Workin on it~ And awesome. Fashion show!"	kmq5j2	NonBinary	564	1.0	2020-12-29 23:54:06
Went to a queer prom and had a blast. I'm still not used to being around so many people that accept my identity without question 😭		"You look amazing!  Love the outfit!
Random ass unquestioned validity is nice
Considering how most schools are I'm *still* surprised you were allowed to wear that
<3
The only thing about that is the more time you spend in accepting places the harder it gets to spend time in those that aren't
You should see if there’s a munch in your area!
That entire outfit is goals! 😍😍😍
you look fabulous!

Ugh. Werd.
Very true
I know, right? Those sexy shoulders, men at my high school weren't allowed to expose theirs either 

Queer proms are often held by other companies though, the bigger one in my city is at the Warhol museum
This one was held by a local organization. But our school let's kids get away with wearing with even more skimpy outfits.

True 😢
A munch?
Why thank you 😘
I mean

I was more focused on  t h i g h s  but yeah
They are events organized by the BDSM community. But don’t feel any pressure! Munches are usually low key groups of people getting drinks or dinner. They are really only intended as a low pressure way to get to know others that express themselves freely and independently. 

To check them out: make a FetLife profile. It’s like Facebook that welcomes people of all identities, lifestyles, and orientations. Then click that big “events” button at the top to check out what’s going on in your area. It’s described in the event what it is, like if it’s a play party, a casual “normal” dinner at a restaurant, or my favorite the gaming munches (usually board games or card games). There is also a “groups” tab, that’s great to stay connected as a group and start threads on a specific topic in that group.

It’s wonderful. The only place that allows me to label my profile with how I feel on the inside :)
Their thighs are amazing too but their knees are covered and they aren't exposed by holes in jeans so it's ok, right?

“Season of Change”. A painting I did, combining images of transmasculinity and springtime! I love exploring my identity through art.		"This is incredible! I love your art style. It's also really cool seeing parts of your process. Love the flowers on the scars!

Thank you!! I’m glad the divinity aspect came across: the piece was almost titled “Divine Transmasculine”, as a reference to the “Divine Feminine” concept.
I do, although I mostly post polymer clay jewelry, not watercolour: @stardust_artwork!

Five months ago, I applied for a job at a relatively conservative department store in the UK with my birth name as I assumed they wouldn't be accepting of my non-binary identity. I quickly learned I was wrong and today my new name badge arrived! It's the little things :)		"When life gives you Lemony, make partner.
That's really sweet. My sister's nickname for me is Lemony, so I find this especially endearing.
I used to be a Waitrose partner and I have to say it was one of the most welcoming places I’ve had the chance to work. 
The partnership has really inclusive policies across the board, which isn’t that surprising for a worker owned co-op, but does seem strange given the “highly conservative” image that John Lewis and Waitrose can’t seem to shake 🤷

Anyway, I love the badges and congrats 🥳
Sorry Lemony, gonna have to squeeze ya with a big hug or two. You know what they say, when life gives you Lemony make lemonade! 🍋😉
The name may make me think of sour things, but the story here is so sweet!
Little things like this give me hope for the world
Amazing! I’m trying to work out which shop it is based on the font, I’m thinking maybe Debenhams? Hard to tell hah
I work for them too!!! But I'm the food side of things. I've honestly found them to be one of the most inclusive companies to work for, from bottom to top. The only thing I'm struggling with is getting my pronouns to be changed on (I think it's workday?) which requires an example of official records changing it (such as birth certificate or sommat like that, which doesn't have an enby option) XD
Duh UK Conservatives are on average nothing like US Conservatives the tories are just completely useless
This is so cool
when life gives you lemony, say snicket.
Just in case you don't know a lot of department stores in the UK give all their employees the title of partner
This is cute because my sibling actually helped me pick my name too :)
I second this. They're making huge efforts to be diverse and welcoming and it really shows. They've recently made amendments to their dress code to stress that it's non gender specific and open to employees' own personal expression. I have bright yellow hair and facial piercings and I was expecting to have to make compromises when I started there but I've seen nothing but kindness! They also let you add pronouns to your biography on the partner network and have about sixteen options if I remember rightly. If a so-called conservative establishment like them can manage to uplift us like this, there's no excuse elsewhere :)
[deleted]
My mother and stepfather used to work for JL when I was young. I just always assumed, learning socialism on my grandfather's knee, that the partnership was low grade a collective.
More like, when life gives you lemons make Lemony 🍋 because Lemony is the desired outcome :)
Me too. I'm constantly worrying about other people's view of me but this has really made me more optimistic about being accepted in future :)
It’s John Lewis, all the staff are partners. I love shopping there.
I changed mine on workday without official records, how did you try to go about it? I just went under Personal Information :)
I love Lemony Snicket, he was part of the inspiration for my name :)
Could you tell me more about this? Legit first I’ve heard of it.
Ah yes, that's certainly a much better way to phrase that one 👍😁
no we will destroy you and make lemonade out of you ^/j
I think myself and so many struggle with that no matter where in the world we are. The things that also helps for me is seeing stuff like this posted online... so that when I can't or don't see it much in a very small town (in the south, in USA) I remember to wear my pins even if it feels like I'm the only one and remember to go online bc we are everywhere and everyone in a way.
Ahhh I should’ve known from the ‘relatively conservative’. Love that they let employees have pride flag pins!
I came to ask about this!
please do not! that sounds painful! :D
It was a Pride Month thing but tonnes of people still wear them- they had loads left over so my line manager said 'take one, take two if you want' and I did! :)
Also congrats!
Thank you! :D"	rjuf2k	NonBinary	541	1.0	2021-12-19 10:52:58
Boyfriend thinks I am faking being nonbinary.	I’ve never had someone be openly aggressive to me about me being non-binary before until tonight. It feels really bad. This person said people think I’m a joke for using they/them pronouns, and that I am definitely cis because I present cis. He screamed in my face. I don’t blame people for misgendering me because I have long hair, usually shop in the women’s clothing section, and wear makeup. I don’t ever correct people when they use she/her to me, even though it makes me uncomfortable when people call me a woman. I like presenting femme. But to have someone tell me my identity is just… a lie… hurts on a really deep level. That I am being a bad ally for identifying as non-binary. That I am stealing someone else’s identity. That I am a fake. It really hurts. And that other queer people are also questioning my identity. I feel insecure. I want to cut off all my hair. I don’t want anyone to look at me or think I’m a woman ever again.	"Thanks everyone for your supportive words. I have decided to break up with the boyfriend. This has just been one painful thing on top of many other painful things, and I know I deserve to have someone in my life who respects me and loves me for who I am. I reached out to a few real life friends tonight and they all agreed too. Breakups are hard but it will be worth it to stand up for myself and show myself some respect. 💕 Thanks again all.
I’m sorry you’re going through this. This is emotional and verbal abuse. Massive red flag.
Hello I am a they/them, masc-presenting AFAB enby. I don't own any make up or dresses. I have short hair and work in a male-dominated field.

You can tell your boyfriend that I think your identity is 100% valid, and there is no such thing as ""stealing"" someone else's identity. I don't even know what that means. 

Go return your boyfriend and get your money back.
I'm sorri 🤗

Honestly it sounds like he's afraid of you being anything other than cis and this relationship might not last 😥
Boyfriend sounds like an ass.

Edit: congratulations on dumping the jerk
Hey that’s a huge red flag. That type of behavior is completely unacceptable and would make me afraid for my safety. I’m so sorry that you are feeling so invalid and insecure after what he did to you. Please consider the fact that your BOYFRIEND  is the one making you feel so bad about yourself. Is that something you want in a partner?

Please sit down and think deeply about what you want in a boyfriend.  What would a loving and fulfilling relationship look like to you? If your boyfriend is not living up to that standard then he needs to go. The bare minimum in my eyes is not getting in my face to verbally abuse and invalidate me. Please be safe and look after your own health and happiness. His behavior is horrifying.
Ahhhhhh congratulations on being single now OP! Sorry you had to deal with that stupid ex
As an AFAB fem-presenting enby, I'm gonna jump in and say OP totally didn't steal my identity either. 

The search to find the poor enby whose identity was stolen continues, but things aren't looking good guys, we might never find them. OP, on the bright side, you are on your way for a brilliant career as a professional thief cause I must admit this first heist, although amatorial, was absolutely flawless :)

(In case it wasn't clear i was 100% sarcastic pls don't blast me thank u)

Also I'm happy to hear you dumped him lol
that's an unacceptable way to treat someone. of course youre valid <3
Ditch the boyfriend. You should never be yelled at for your identity, and honestly should generally not be yelled at at all (barring being about to injure yourself or others)
Heard you broke up with him, which I am glad to hear, because you deserve better. It's never easy to leave someone you love though, or even just someone you care deeply about. I hope you're doing alright. Just know you are loved and supported here. Also, you'll find someone who loves you just the way you are eventually, don't forget that - how you identify is valid and there is nothing wrong with it.
Good that you're breaking up. Not accepting you for you isn't something a partner will suddenly change. 

> that other queer people are also questioning my identity

Those people are assholes. Nonbinary isn't ""one"" thing...

> I want to cut off all my hair. I don’t want anyone to look at me or think I’m a woman ever again.

You can't control others, only yourself. Don't cut your hair just because others are jerks if you like having long hair. Even if you cut your hair off, some people will just find another ""reason"" to misgender you.
Hey I’m an AFAB femme non-binary who solely uses they/them but doesn’t correct people when they say she/her. I have long hair and shop in the women’s section because I think women’s clothes are cute. 

I’m non-binary as fuck. And so are you.
I have a boyfriend who supports my gender identity and doesn’t feel uncomfortable about me being myself completely, autism included.  I hope that you will find someone like that for yourself.
So glad you're breaking up. You don't need that negative energy in your life
dump his crusty ass and block him, i dont understand why you still stick around. he doesnt give a crap about you or how he makes you feel. im sorry for what he's put you through tho, your identity is valid.
Update: the deed is done. The breakup text has been sent.
I'm sorry that happened to you, I'm glad you broke up with him, he sounds shitty. You are nonbinary! Doesn't matter how you present. Just in case you need to hear it again.
I’m so sorry this happened to you. Your identity is not up for debate. 

This is also kinda the reason I’ll stay in the closet indefinitely. If my boyfriend acted like this toward me, I don’t know how I could cope.
Good riddance to him, everybody should be supported by people who love and validate them 💕
Fuck him. You could be AFAB and dress like a 60s women straight out of a kitchen utensil commercial and that wouldn't make you less of who you are.
A lot of people are saying break up with him. Don't break up with him - dump him. There's a difference.
I’m sorry you are experiencing this. As a mostly femme presenting non-binary individual who doesn’t advocate for themselves, I feel this in my soul. I just take the misgendering and laugh it off. I won’t speak out because I am non-confrontational when it comes to matters about me but I will speak out for others. 

Does this make you or I any less of our identity? No. I think it’s more of a reflection of the society we live in. Should we have to advocate for our gender identity when it is known? Should we be in positions where others knowingly misgender us and laugh about it? It’s harmful and kind of abusive and not okay. But whether or not you’re comfortable to speak against it doesn’t make you more of a “woman” or a “man”. You are still what you identify as. Their choice to accept that and behave is a reflection of their character not on your identity.
Good for you for breaking up with him. 

People can’t seem to understand that non-binary does NOT mean androgynous. It’s not a third gender that rides the line between man and woman. It simply means that you don’t identify as a man or a woman. 

Non-binary is in and of itself an extremely vague label, and IMO that’s a good thing. 

Im a non-binary person who very much looks like my AGAB, but that doesn’t make me (or you) any less of a non-binary person.
I'm so sorry. These aren't good friends or partners if they can't make room for the fact that nonbinary doesn't look like one singular thing and one can present differ ways and be nonbinary. You deserve room to express yourself authentically and be affirmed by people who truly love and see you. 

You aren't fake and you aren't invalid.
What a prick. Glad you're dumping his sorry ass
I'm so relieved to come to the comments to see you kicked him to the curb. Good for you. I present femme 80% of the time, still an enby. You don't owe anyone androgyny.
Tell him the only thing you’re faking is your feelings for him. You deserve someone supportive.
Hi, Im also nonbinary and present femme because well, making myself appear androgynous takes time, money, and effort that I don't have right now. I use any/all pronouns and mostly just cringe when someone calls me a woman or girl.

I'm sure others have said it, but I will again anyway. You don't owe anyone androgyny. Present how you want to for whatever reasons you want to. You aren't stealing someone else's identity. A huge point of being nonbinary is that you get to define your own expression, whether that's within or outside of typical gender norms. 

I'm glad you're dropping the boyfriend.
I just wanted to drop a comment to say presentation does not equal gender, and you don’t owe anyone androgyny.

I struggled with my gender identity for a while, finally settling on gender-fluid (though my personal experience is somewhat bi-gender as well), and even on days that I am male, which is most days, I present femme because I don’t feel like I need to reject “women’s” clothing in order to be a man.  The fact that I have dysphoria and would be willing to get my tits cut off is proof enough for me (though I’m not saying that you have to have dysphoria to be under the trans umbrella).

I read through some of the comments, and I’m glad you’re cutting off your relationship with someone so judgmental.  I wish you the best of luck moving forward!
I apologize 4 the queer ppl whom say such and wanna assure you that you're 100% valid.
You mean ex-boyfriend
The boyfriend sucks a lot and I’m happy you are breaking up with him. If you have no attachment to your hair and like the idea of presenting more androgynous, short hair is something I’ve liked and has made me feel better about presenting femme still as well :) most importantly though present however you want. Non-binary doesn’t look like anything, non-binary breaks the gendered need to stuff everyone in boxes. You can be a femme non-binary person. It’s okay.
How are you doing? I think we are all here for moral support 💜
I can tolerate a lot of wrong assumptions because there's much I'm not ready to share, and even more I am not sure how to share and show; but not from a partner. A partner should hear me, not scream my wrongness.
This person sounds hurtful and to be honest abusive. Very glad to see you decided to end things with this person. 

You know who you are, don't let assholes dictate to you who you are.
I'm sorry that other ""queer"" people think this as well. They're probably cis gay dudes lmao
Tell him to eff off and stop being such an immature twat, you deserve better. Presentation and gender aren't the same thing, and nonbinary is an umbrella term for a bajillion different genders, anyways.
Sorry this happened to you. You should never have to cut your hair or get a surgery or not wear gender oriented clothes or not do gender oriented things just to be “more non-binary.” Anyone who tells you any different doesn’t even know what they’re talking about. Doing any of the above will never ever make you less enby.
Yeah sometimes friends and family for me are like this. I mean they don’t try to misgender me on purpose but it’s not like an active practicing either where they literally identify me using “they/them” as part of their speech to me and I cut off all my hair so lmao. I identify as she/they because I think it’s too hard for most of them to use anything else. I am very fortunate to have a partner who supports me and even offers his clothes to me. Sometimes I get very agitated where I have to say loudly “I’m not a girl” like I did a few times at game nights. It’s not great that you’re being ignored (too). I definitely empathize with you. Personally if my partner wasn’t able to accept and support me, I don’t think we could be together. I think your boyfriend may have issues with it because it may make him feel like he needs to question his attraction towards you, which isn’t fair. It’s just odd he’d be so belligerent towards you like it’s hurting *him*. He’s obviously embarrassed but he should be embarrassed about himself and his behavior. It’s been a journey for sure but just know you’re not alone. ❤️🏳️‍🌈
I am an afab femme presenting enby (although I’m not trying to be femme presenting but people tend to gender everything and think that I am… but I did get called a tomboy by a cis friend who didn’t know I was enby the other day so that was a nice change despite being gendered lol!) 

Anyway.. I completely get the fears of people thinking your identity is a lie and wanting to change things about yourself for people to see you differently because of that. And ultimately if that makes you the most comfortable and happy with yourself, go for it. But don’t think that you have to in order to be valid in your identity as non-binary. Because it’s called called non-binary for a reason. And outside the binary doesn’t necessarily mean you present androgynous or as the opposite gender you were assigned at birth. You can present yourself and express yourself however you want without assigning a gender to it. 

Who said that long hair is for femmes and short for mascs and that’s it for everyone? That’s the same as saying pink is automatically a girls color. Gendering everything is creating a binary. Wearing what you want and expressing yourself however you want despite traditional binary gender roles is non-binary.
Your boyfriend is not respecting you, and he is not loving you for who you are. You deserve a partner who truly loves and supports you.
That ain't your boyfriend anymore. That is a pile of refuse.
Oh bb I’m so sorry that’s just terrible. I’m glad I saw your update and you left because the level of disrespect here is astounding. Be kind to yourself, your presentation is yours and yours alone. Keep looking however makes you happy!! Sending love and validation
Cuz your boyfriend's a b*tch! No seriously that's some terrible treatment, you so deserve better! You are non-binary, you are valid, and if you can afford that, dump him as soon as you can.
pls just leave your boyfriend, you deserve better. Honestly be glad its not your parents assumed that they think know everything about you when they really dont. Last year, I told my mom that  my gender expression Androgyous and you know i thought she took pretty well or so  I thought. but  I still having those questions about it  because I wanted to feel comfortable in my own body despite me not experiencing any gender dysphoria. When I found out about Gender nonconformity made feel like I belonged int the LGBTQ community 

&#x200B;

The one thing that made me feel disappointed was my mom telling me That androgyous means non binary just  because I told her that I dont care which clothes I would wear whether if it for a female or male I would still both.............. but shockingly enough this after when I told her that I was Genderqueer.........and well It didnt go so well my mom told me that Genderqueer means that Im a lesbian  and that I was accepting theses labels for no  reason. parents are gonna make damn assumptions about you when they dont know everything about. I didnt say her that Girls, identify as nonbinary, all I want was for her to accept my gender expression and Gender identity
someone once told me something that has stuck with me for years: breakups almost always suck, but they're also almost always *good* things. the changing or ending of a relationship usually signals a time of growth or healing. in your case, it sounds like this is learning that you deserve to be respected and don't have to settle for people who don't love you the way you are.

there's no such thing as ""presenting cis,"" although I think we all know what is meant by it. having long hair doesn't make you less nonbinary anymore than having short hair does. doing makeup or dressing fem doesn't make you any less nonbinary than having a beard or dressing masc. what's ironic is nobody would have said you ""present cis"" if you were amab. why do they thing there are different ways to present nonbinary depending on our AGAB? that sounds, well, pretty binary. ignore them <3
I breathed such a sign of relief reading this comment, no joke. Anyone who is comfortable screaming at their partner, calling them a joke like that is not someone who will provide a healthy relationship. You deserve so, so much better. It'll be hard in the short term and so insanely worth it in the longterm, I am so proud of you ❤️
I’m so relieved to hear that. I’m also so sorry that you had to be let down so badly by someone who is supposed to love and support you. I hope this is just one of many steps you take to actively bring love and happiness into your life. Its a hard thing to do and none of us are perfect, but you don’t deserve to be abused in the way your boyfriend abused you. Please always remember that 💜
I agree that breakups are difficult, but if the person can’t accept you for who you are, then it’s not worth it. You’ll make it work, and you have our full support!
Good on you sweetie! If he's able to treat you like that once, he'd probably do it again, and you deserve better! Remember, no matter how femme or masc you present, you are 100% valid!❤️
Best of luck love, breakups hurt, but yeah, sometimes it's the thing which has to be done to preserve your self worth. 💜
I'm so glad to hear this. Sending all the good vibes your way.
Good for you OP <3
People suck 😥
Yes! So sorry you had to deal with that. You are valid as you are and your identity is yours to decide. Best wishes ✨
Life’s too short to stay with abusive and non-supportive partners. You made the right call. 💖
Proud of you!
Your identity is your own and I’m proud you stood up for yourself! I hope all the happiness to you, and thank you for being an inspiration in our community! ❤️🙏
You deserve happiness and supportive relationships - the right people are out there and are able to love you as you are. I’m 48 and have been happily with my wife for almost 13 years when I finally put the obvious pieces together that I was non-binary. She was and continues to be supportive and loving and understanding. And accepting as I slowly navigate my way through this, switching to he/they, etc.
It’s good that you broke up with him and tho it may be hard you don’t need that toxicity in your life. You will find someone out there for you I believe in you.
I'm so glad.  My first thought reading through this was ""holy shit why does the title not say EX-boyfriend?!?""  Nobody deserves to be treated like this, and ESPECIALLY not by their partner.  If your partner isn't affirming your gender identity, they don't deserve to be your partner.
Good for you OP! He sounds ignorant and hateful. Good riddance
I already know this sub has got your back, but I want to be another voice telling you that you are valid and you deserve so much more than what this person is giving you. Sending you so much love and strength- it will be difficult but you deserve better.
wdym ""red flag"". Instant Break up
This made me smile. Thank you. 💕
Afab, fem-presenting enby, here too. Nope, my identity is also safe.
Yes! Exactly! My most complimented shirt is from the boys section (not mens) does that make my 30 yo ass a little boy? 

I have to remind myself all the time too, especially when I wear makeup, there's no way to present nonbinary.
Honestly kind of shitty. I do feel super validated by everyone who has commented, I am not at all doubting my identity, but my feelings are really hurt by the boyfriend. I am a non confrontational person and I have been trying to work up the courage to try to talk to him to break things off, but it’s so hard. I am also worried he’s going to make fun of me to his friends (who are also my friends) and just afraid of everyone talking about me behind my back about my gender identity being fake. I feel a little traumatized tbh. I don’t want to be yelled at again.
> having long hair doesn't make you less nonbinary anymore than having short hair does.

It makes you more metal, lol. General length of hair being gendered is silly.

> breakups almost always suck, but they're also almost always good things.

To put it another way, breakups suck, but so does being in a relationship where both people aren't happy.
nah Life and people suck the most
I don’t think they disagree. A massive red flag definitely constitutes instant break up
Yesterday I neatly folded my identity and put it on a chair, but today I can't find it. OP must have stolen it. :P

OP, glad that you are getting away from this person! I think he is deeply misogynistic and loves feeling better than women. That is a reason why he gets so aggressive when you want to get out of that little box.
Crap, the mystery deepens
Exactly. There is only societies expectations, which the point of enby is to shatter 💜
Do you live together? If not, I'd say do it over text and if your friends get gossiped to, show then this post.
Yeah I know, I just heard ""Massive Red Flag"" for everything on r/Tinder
I as well, I swear I put it somewhere, but I just can’t find it anywhere, I have my sneaking suspicions about OP. Just kidding, what’s my gender (*can be*) your gender. Anyone who gets mad at you for “stealing their gender” doesn’t know how gender works. As long as your gender is what makes you comfortable, then that’s all that matters in this sense.
I did it by text. I completely cut things off and said no contact.
Alright, well probably don't take social queues from r/Tinder
Good for you! You doin okay?
Yeah, hanging in there. Luckily I have like three friends that have been talking to me through the process so I don’t feel totally alone. I have pushed people away a bit in the relationship… but luckily I have some really awesome friends that know I’m NB and support me all the way.
Good, I'm glad you have support!"	11pvntq	NonBinary	535	0.99	2023-03-13 01:03:47
My future sister-in-law put “mx.” on my wedding invitation 🥺	"My partner’s brother is getting married later this year, and tonight his fiancé (and, assuming I marry my partner which I intend to do, my future sister-in-law) handed me my wedding invitation. I’m openly non-binary, but I look like what a lot of people think my AGAB (female) looks like, I use she/they pronouns, and I don’t really personally mind that most strangers probably see me as a woman. As a result I really only reveal my actual gender identity to people when I feel safe to, though it’s easy to figure out by looking at my social media. 

I’m currently visiting my partner’s family — we don’t live near them so this is only my second time meeting them. Obviously I’m not super close with any of them. My future sister-in-law must have picked up on me being non-binary, maybe through my social media or through my partner, because when she handed me the invitation my heart melted because she had put “Mx.” before my name 🥺😭 I don’t even mind “Ms.” to be honest but it was so thoughtful and I immediately thanked her for making me feel so seen. She said that she was excited when she wrote that because she had never actually used that for someone before. 

Cheers for wonderful, thoughtful allies like her, and for having them in your family ❤️❤️"	"That makes my non-binary but often cis-assumed heart so happy.
I'm new to all this but what is MX?
This is absolutely fantastic and amazing ❤️❤️
:D
This is so sweet :')
That's so sweet!
This is so sweet!! It’s so nice to know that your (future) in-laws are good people :)
Wow, that’s amazing!
Gender neutral version of Mr/Ms
OK thanks, how do you pronounce?
There are several diefferent ways to pronounce it. This survey from the annual gender census gives a pretty good overview on what is most used: [https://gendercensus.com/results/2019-mx/](https://gendercensus.com/results/2019-mx/)
I've heard it said as if it were spelled m-i-x

Hope this helps xxx
interesting. i say the schwa one, but i think ""mix"" is cooler. though thinking about it though, if someone is addressing me by title it means we're not familiar. therefore they don't know my pronouns or title anyway, so i never get to hear it said to me directly
It could be used by coworkers if you're not addressing eachother by your first name.

I also like the pronounciation mix better."	nl7hdf	NonBinary	534	1.0	2021-05-26 03:39:27
"My parents say that i ""won't be taken seriously"" when applying for jobs because of my chosen name on a CV"	"The title may come across as my parents only trying to ""protect me from discrimination"", but read the post for context. (TLDR at the bottom)

I (16) am non binary, and have been identifying as such for three years. my parents are not supportive and continually misgender and deadname me on a regular basis.

I was in the middle of writing a CV as i want to apply for a part time job over the summer (in like a bookstore or a school shop) and i asked my mom to quickly review it to see if there was anything i should add or remove from it. After giving me tips, she noticed my name at the top of the document and told me to change it to my deadname as they ""wouldn't possibly take me seriously with a name like that"".

i prefer not to share my name online for privacy reasons but my chosen name looks like a nickname for my deadname, so it won't be as obvious that i am a trans person but whilst still making me feel comfortable with the name as it is different to my deadname.

my dad agreed with her and told me to change it as it was not ""formal"", everything escalated into an argument. it wasn't even about the job anymore, it was the fact that they don't take my gender identity seriously as it's ""too hard"". it's really not a big ask. i'm not even going to come out at the workplace. literally my tutor, year head and the deputy principal of my school call me my chosen name when that's in a formal setting lmao.

i know i'm valid and they're simply ignorant people when it comes to being transgender and lgbtq in general, and quite frankly they'll never learn, but it's just really hard when you have your primary caregivers trying to dictate who you are and what you should be just because you're their child. i just want basic respect from them.

tldr: i'm aware that the possibilities of facing discrimination as a trans person are there when it comes to jobs, but i'm not exactly outing myself as a trans person at the same time, just as someone who doesn't go by their birth name. my parents think this is an extremely big deal and demand that i use my deadname as i ""shouldn't be taken seriously for my chosen name"" and they mock me for it, not for my protection or anything.

EDIT: i didn't know until now that the word 'transgenderism' is a derogatory term, so i have changed my wording in the sentence it was in - my apologies for that!"	"Put what you want to be called on your resume and job application. Put your legal name on things related to taxes. Any company that would pass judgement on someone solely because of their name isn't a company worth working for anyway.
Will some places judge you on that? Yeah. Do you want to work at the places that won't hire you because of that? Probably not.
I'm NB and used to work in HR.

Weird names get noticed, yes, but I can't imagine it would be judged. If nothing else, those names are more often birth names given by parents than chosen names, not to mention folks from other cultures.

I seriously can't see it being an issue, even a trans-phobic place wouldn't flag it because they'd assume it's your birth name until told otherwise.
[Dr. Marijuana Pepsi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana_Pepsi_Vandyck)’s name—which she was assigned at birth, not that it matters—didn’t hold her back.
I have my preferred name and pronouns on my resume and have gotten work with it. It's possible it will affect the hiring manager's opinion, but so would any other information you choose to list which could appeal to an internalized bias. 

It's just as likely to make your CV stand out as memorable and indicate authenticity.
If I waa an employer and wanted to employ a 16 year-old for the summer I would be okay if their name is Toe or Kelp or whatever. I just expect you to do your entry level job
I mean, my NB child's (12) legal given (by me) name is River. Names are wild now a day anyway. And any parent who says accepting you is ""too hard"" only sees you as an extension of themselves and their ego. I'm sorry your parents are like that. Hopefully, they will come around, but know there is a bug community who loves and accepts you.

*Mom hug* (if you are comfortable with that)
While such discrimination is *probably* illegal, that doesn't mean you won't face it. Realistically, it will reduce your options. That said, it will also help filter out some nasty work environments. Ultimately I'd say it depends on how badly you need the work.
They can fuck off tbh.

Put the name you want to be called by, I doubt anywhere would judge you negatively or take you less seriously for such a thing (and if they did, they wouldn't be worth your time in the first place)
It used to be “cover up tattoos” and other things like that.  Clearly not applicable in this day & age.  Times have changed and you’re right to put a name you’d like to be called on your resume so that if you get the job you can be known by that name.  Otherwise it’s confusing!
[removed]
I worked with someone who only called herself ""Bug"" so I think you'll be fine. She owns her own business now, the name suits her and while I'm aware of her birth name that's just a legal matter & it is just not her name, her name is Bug.
You put your name on that resume.
If someone discriminates based on a name you probably don't wanna work for them anyway.
Start calling them by their first names. 

They will correct you and say it’s their preference or a matter of respect. 

…tell them to do finish that start.
As a professional adult I’ve applied to jobs with my preferred name (I don’t say it that way just put it in the name spot on my resume) and pronouns on my resume and companies that don’t want to hire me automatically self select themselves out. Also have a chosen name that looks like a nickname for my legal name so should be fine
My CV also contains my nickname derived from my birthname and during the sessions revolving around CVs I've had at uni lately none of my tutors or the external professional running the optional sign up workshop specifically about designing a good CV had an issue with this at all.

It's like someone called Charlotte putting Charlie or someone called Robert putting Bob - if it's clearly derived from a longer birthname and is what you prefer to be called I really don't see an issue with it, especially for a Summer job as a 16 year old.
I think applying for my Job with my real name and pronouns actually raised my chance of getting hired.
Oh lord. Listen, a guy named Spoon ran for my local town council last month. It's fine. You're fine.
My name is Pluto my parents told me no one would hire me with a name like that ive had no problem getting hired. None at all. Our parents are transphobic and ignorant for thinking a name is enough to prevent you from getting a job. Do what you need to to be comfortable, how are you supposed to stay mentally healthy if you have to be deadnamed almost daily.
Its hard to say without knowing the name, but let's say it's a short version of a common name such as someone going by Jackie instead of Jonathan or Jacqueline. 


There is bias in job applications based on names (gender, race, nationality,  etc) but I think this vs ""sounding professional"" can more often be a concern when it comes to say hiring white collar profession jobs.  Might a hypothetical ""Jackie"" get turned down for a judge clerk job over a ""Jonathan""? Maybe. But you are talking about like an entry level retail job. You can look around the store first and probably get a sense of the gender/age/racial diversity of a place, and see that for plenty of such jobs will not care about something like a name.  


This isn't to say none will, since some retail can be toxic in all sorts of ways.  It's also certainly not to justify bias in any job.  No one should be judged for their name, gender, orientation, race, etc, but yes it does happen in the real world at all sorts of levels.  But my experience is that at the retail level they care far more about can you show up on time and not lose your temper at a customer. 


This sounds more like (a) your parents like your deadname and (b) are trying to sway you back towards using that full time or at least out in public. Maybe they feel it reflects badly on them, or they don't want others to find out.  Either way it's kind of a backhanded way to put pressure on you to use it, and I'm betting 9/10 times your chosen name will be fine. You could ""compromise"" by putting on the resume you show them, but submit your own name when you actually apply, if that keeps the peace.  If this job will have a name tag (very few do but some will), that can be it's own battle then.


Hope that helps, sorry for this situation and good luck with whatever your new job ends up being.
If you don't get a job because they are transphobic towards you(because that's what it is) then you don't want to be working there anyway.

While illegal in many place, discrimination does still happen. Probably less of an issue for summer entry level jobs. Nicknames are common, and I've also known people with odd legal names. 

Sucks about your parents, working as a clerk in a bookstore isn't that ""formal"" of a job. Queer people working in bookstores definitely isn't uncommon.
 There are people who will accept you even though your parents don’t. Some of the best “gender affirming” comments come from new people calling you exactly what you ask them to. Things will get so much better for you.
Most jobs I've applied for ask for my legal name and then have a field where you can enter what you're called. My LinkedIn has my legal name as well as my preferred name. If anything, it's useful because if someone calls and asks for ""Legalname"" I know it's a scammer.
First of all, you’re not applying to be executive vice president of a Fortune 500, you’re applying for a shitty retail job that probably pays minimum wage. No one gives a shit what your name is. (You WILL, however, certainly face discrimination for being trans throughout your career and even now.) Most people get jobs because they know someone. Do you know anyone who works where you want to work? If so, ask them to get you a job. Many don’t require a resume, you just walk in and fill out an application (or do it online). Use the name you want people to call you. 

(Side note: you’re not writing a CV - or curriculum vitae, which means ‘life’s work’ -you have no life’s work. You’re, at best, writing a resume, but if this is your first job a resume won’t have much on it. What you DO want to get across is that you’re serious, you’re a hard worker, and you won’t flake on them by not showing up or coming in late. You can list any relevant skills or interests you have, like ‘avid reader’ for a bookstore. )
As a hiring manager of many years. 
Your father is speaking from a different time. 
I assure you that you will be fine. 
And in fact better to use the name you want to be called. 
It's very confusing to do an interview or hire a ""Lawrence Smarmy McFancypants III"" and then try and remember to call the person Cole.
I recently went through a hot second between jobs and doing job apps. I put my pronouns (he/they) on my resume. I got hired and I'm starting my new job on Monday.

Job applications are a two way selection process. If you see red flags (like signs they don't respect queer identities, or racist hiring practices, etc) then that's your signal that this is not a healthy environment to work and thrive in. 

If somewhere won't accept you for who you are, you should find somewhere else to be as soon as you safely can. This applies to jobs, to parents, to friends, and damn near everything else.
I do a similar thing where my chosen name is essentially a nickname for my legal name for many reasons. I've never once had an issue with any employer using it as my name and I never had to out myself. The only issue I've run into is if I'm on a phone call some people think I'm saying Beth and not Beck and it makes me wanna die inside lol but really not a huge deal. I just really pronounce the k now. Apparently people don't know how to listen in person either cause I gotta repeat it like 3-4 times sometimes and it's like???? There's literally a musician with this name come on now. Y'all never heard of the letter k?

Anyways lmao, you'll be okay, ignore them. As long as you use your legal name for legal documents that's all that matters. Most employers ask what your preferred name is anyway for your name tag cause a lot of people go by a nickname.
bruh... these modern moms will name their kids everything possible under the Sun. im sure your name isnt the issue at all
If you named yourself, idk, Zagreus or Arson or something I would consider also picking a “work name” that feels decent to you. It probably WILL reduce your job options a bit and might lead to annoyances at work if people pester you about it. 

If your name is something that someone could feasibly have been given as a birth name, though, they’re just complaining about it to complain.
My college roommate was named something that looked like a nickname. If you have a name that is really out there or extremely goofy, I could understand your parents being concerned. However, I think that anyone who is hiring a 16 year old is probably not going to freak out if you are named Van or Li. Good luck with your job!
The way to protect you from discrimination is to do something about the discrimination.  Victim-blaming serves no one except the establishment. 

She's projecting her own bigotry. ""We assume of others what we know of ourselves.""  She knows she doesn't take you seriously as your name, and so assumes no one else will either.

to be -very- precise, most minors do get stuck with the shit name their parents chose for them, but! even the cis can change their names. it's just that parents don't like that. i've noticed that some parents take it as a personal affront if you don't keep the name they gave you, and sometimes has nothing to do with the kid's gender(s) and everything to do with the parents' egos and their perception of their child as an extension of themselves/achievement, so. .... there's that™
use your name.

if a company is going to discriminate against you for that, would you even want to work for them?
no.
I'm openly non-binary at my job. It's a corporate job in the game industry and I've been met with open arms for the most part. I say 'for the most part' because if people have an issue they are keeping it to themselves. 

Will you come across jobs that will judge you and not hire you because of this? Sure, that will happen even if you remain what your parents want you to be. People judge others, it's a fact across the board. However, additional risks come for us, mainly in the safety department. Only you get to decide what you will risk to be who you are. 

I risked my career, and have no regrets. I was prepared to be quietly shifted out, but I've gotten many commendations for my work instead. 

My advise is know the risks and understand the consequences your decisions can have. Then make the best decision for your life. I get you are not an adult yet, but I think we need to let kids make decisions as they get closer to adulthood. In just 2 years you will be a legal adult. 

The world can be a cruel place but it's also filled with so much beauty, tolerance and inclusion. You just have to find where you belong. 

I wish you all the luck OP!
When I applied for my job I put my birth name, thankfully I have a birth name that has like 1000 different nicknames so everyone always asks me "" so do u go by this or this ECT"" and I always can tell them my chosen name, I go by it at work, they don't know that I'm trans and Im scared to tell them (not because I'm scared they will do anything it's just not something I like doing) but on everything important
Your parents are wrong. Put your chosen name on your resume and application. When you are hired, give your legal name on your tax forms. I have the nickname version of my legal name on all of my resumes, email address, etc. etc.  It's what I go by. My legal name literally only shows up on tax forms and doctor's paperwork. 

If they won't get off your back about it, you can tell them to check the Ask a Manager blog, as she'd say the same thing.
Unless your chosen name is something like Princess Bubblebutt - which I highly doubt, based on your description - your parents are just being jerks.  Put whatever name you want people to call you on your resume.  I sometimes put *Legal first name (Nickname) Last name* on mine but that's because I'm ok with both.
Hi! I have a name that is different from my legal name. I put my name and pronouns at the top of my resume and when I’m offered the job I let HR know that I have a different legal name they need to use for legal documents. My mom was confused by what I do when this came up and I explained it to her as I just did. It’s really not a big deal. Some older folks think it’s a huge deal and makes it difficult but it’s not. I just make it clear that my name is my name and use my legal name only when I have to. Any respectable organization will take you seriously.
My name is a gender neutral portion of my birth name (think like ‘Sam’) - I am in my 30s and work as a graphic designer in a corporate finance environment. No one has ever had an issue with my name. People generally don’t care unless they struggle to pronounce a name, and even then it’s embarrassment at their own struggle in that case. 

In my casual summer jobs I worked with a “Moss” - no one was concerned by that name either. Most managers dealing with teenagers are accustomed to working with younger people with different ideas of “professionalism” and having a name you like to be called is normal. IIRC, my last University job made you fill in your preferred name - you had to type out your full name if that’s what you want. If you have to, print a copy with your deadname and let them see that - then hand out your actual name to actual jobs.
Put your chosen name. I have plenty of friends and former classmates being taken plenty seriously as lawyers using their chosen names. Because it is their name.
i can relate to this, i’m going to college in the fall and my parents are not happy about me wanting to live in gender inclusive housing
My mom said similar things when i was writing up my cv but she added that my legal name is required on a cv. I searched up on Google and it gave me several results that you can put your preferred name on your cv, no ""legal name required"" bullshit.
Just put your preferred name on there, parents can't do anything about it.

Edit: This is just a thing i noticed but the cv's with my preferred name were more accepted than the cv with the legal name.
I put my dead name on job applications because I thought it was illegal if I didn't 😭
Tell your well-meaning but stupid parents that I legally changed my name to Rizzo and got into a graduate program as a medical laboratory professional and all my clinical rotation sites love me and call me by my REAL (chosen) name. I've worked in multiple hospitals as Rizzo, both before and after it was my legal name. 

Discrimination 100% exists, but it's also societally frowned upon to discriminate against people. People (hiring managers) like to think they are good, reasonable people, and so try not to discriminate (if they are not raging assholes). 

If you expect discrimination, you will see it everywhere. If you are open to letting people surprise you, you will discover that people are willing to look past what they don't understand a lot of the time. Don't let the media make you believe every trans/enby person is struggling. The fact is, a lot of us are thriving.
Sounds like you got a good head on your shoulders, I’m sure you’ll manage to get one of the jobs you’re going for! And like a lot of others said, any jobs that wouldn’t take your name seriously aren’t places you want to work at anyways. Sorry your parents aren’t getting that.
I have never put my legal name on any resume or CV, I’m 30, and I’ve had many jobs here and there. From part time jobs when I was younger to career jobs.

It sounds like you’re already aware BUT their reaction is definitely based on their own issues and inability to accept you for who you are. Be you, put your real name (not your dead name), go forth and see how many people will accept and respect you!
Ugh you meet cis people with bizarre names all the time and they get hired no problem. It sucks that your parents are like that :/
I (nonbinary adult) initially read just the tldr and I wasn't going to comment because you have received some good answers that I agree with here, but after reading the whole post I realize that your parents sound similar to mine in some ways, and I could share my experiences with them with you. 

My parents were always very controlling. My mother dictated what I was to be called when I was younger. She had specific rules about it; I was only allowed to use nicknames she allowed. Needless to say, I've had to have them on an information diet for what I'll tell them about my thoughts and feelings. There are other reasons for that which I shall not get into here. 

Among the feelings I never had the guts to share with them (until recently) were my feelings about my gender. They don't accept me and are uneducated on all of this stuff. They would never consider using my pronouns and they constantly misgender me. They won't be open minded enough to allow me to inform them of what the truth actually is about these things, and so they will probably continue to be bigots. They also have this thing where ""humor is when we make fun of everyone we say we love, laugh about it, and you can't say anything or do anything because we'll be hurt that you took it seriously."" They'll make fun of funny sounding names, dyed hair, look down on people with tattoos and people who don't believe in their religion ... Most of it absolutely falls under the categories of racism, xenophobia, and transphobia. Because of all of this, my parents will hopefully never know my chosen name. 

About showing your parents your CV: depending on how old they are and when they were last applying for jobs, they might not be the best people to go to for advice. They may have some very old fashioned ideas that aren't really relevant anymore. You also already know that they don't accept who you are, and they are purposely hurting you by not using your chosen name and pronouns. I hate to be the one to suggest this as it is a very painful thought to have, and anyone would want to believe the opposite of their parents, but your parents may not have your best interests in mind. My parents have an agenda. That includes trying to get me to follow their religion and keep control over me. I don't know your parents so I can't say what they want to do. But please be aware that not all parents are the loving people they claim to be.
“Not being taken seriously” is shit that cissies love to hold over our heads. I say, fuck it. Apply with your name, man. If you send out numerous (and I mean maybe 10) applications with no luck, then maybe switch it up. You’ll never know if you don’t try. Chances are, since you’re 16 and applying to a summer job (and you didn’t mention it being work-study or an internship) it doesn’t matter what you’re name is.
As someone who's been in change of hiring, I can tell you that the name is nearly the last thing I look at, and frequently forget the candidate's name in favor of looking through expirience.

You name isn't going to hurt your chances, finding a job at 16 with no previous work expirience will though. The toughest hurdle is getting that first job, but it's going to have nothing to do with your name. As someone who's hired high schoolers- make an impression, be kind, be eager, be enthusiastic, and it's okay to reference that you are nervous at a job interview. 

Best of luck, and sorry about your parents. Peace and love- they likely have no idea what it's like nowadays. 


On a morally grey note- I'd be most likely to hire someone like you out of other equally qualified candidates.
Inclusivity hire feels bad, like being a token, but God damn is that a real phenomenon AND a foot in the door. It's okay to use it, and I'd encourage it if the company/interviewer feels like an ally.
I haven’t changed my name, but I am in a highly professional position and out as non-binary. They’re full of shit, and you’re absolutely fine.
I used to work for the state government (parks & rec) with a preferred name as well as my legal one.  If the old park rangers could handle it and the state bureaucracy could handle it, I bet pretty much any job you pick can handle yours too.
I put my chosen name on my résumé’s when I was applying for jobs. It also sounds like a nickname. (My legal name is now the formal version of it but I still go by the nickname all the time and would still put it on a resume.)

It never caused me any issues.
Honey, I work in CONSTRUCTION, and these burly, hairy, sweaty, constantly-spitting dudes and dudettes have ZERO problem calling me by my chosen name. I'm starting to find that many of these companies now have a place in their record keeping specifically for chosen names. I've worked with hundreds of different people at this point and exactly one person gave me a hard time. So I stopped working with him. Your parents are lame and making up lame things to try and keep you from doing your thing because they don't want to be embarrassed. They aren't actually worried about your feelings at all but they don't want to admit that. This is a really common way people try to ""nicely"" control people they are close to.

Tldr: You do you, boo!! You's a star!
Do it anyway. You don't want to work for someone who wouldn't hire you for your name anyway.
I always put my prefered name/s (I still haven't decided on a name but i usually put the name I am currently using/testing) on the very top in big font on my resumes. And then i put the legal stuff and contact info in the smaller font under it, like my legal name, my email, and phone number. I also include my pronouns. 

(Name)_______.

(Pronouns).

Legal Name: _______.

(Contact info).

This way I can make sure they know that the name I will be using at work is different from my legal name/deadname, and that I use certain pronouns. If they are thrown off by that at all, I know they don't have the same values as me and I know not to go forward with the job. My advice is to not accept a job offer where they state that they cannot use your specified pronouns and name, and they will only be using your legal name and pronouns associated with your gender assigned at birth. Even if it's a good paying job/internship, it's not going to be good for your mental health and overall job experience.  

They will need your legal name as part of the requirements for the background check, if applicable (not all jobs do this), but for the most part, many jobs use nicknames for their employees anyway, so there really shouldn't be an issue concerning them using your name instead of your deadname (unless you're in a formal setting or a government job). 

I say go ahead with putting your chosen name on your documents, but keep in mind that at some point your legal name will come across, so make sure to tell someone that you don't use that name. 

Good luck!
Hi! I occasionally get to review résumés (CVs) for new hires at my job, and the name is literally the last part I let myself look at so I don’t form impressions based on unconscious bias. That said I’m always very happy when a resume I have already found impressive has an usual, unique, or otherwise “weird” name at the top…because I’m a big weirdo and am most comfortable around other weirdos.
Having an unusual name could very well help you land the job that you’ll be happiest in anyway, and if it keeps ignorant ass hats from taking you seriously, well, you didn’t wanna work for those losers anyway.
your parents are full of shit and also abusive
When I read your title, I thought your name might be Sock or something (cool name, but yeah that resume is probably getting thrown out). But dude, a nickname to your deadname?? I see absolutely no reason why that wouldn’t receive as much respect as the full name itself.
The same thing could be said for any name that doesn't conform to dominative cultural practices and norms, whether they're chosen or given. Frankly, the idea that they mock you for having an ""abnormal"" name doesn't just signal transphobia to me but a disrespect for anything non-normative, if not some latent bigotry even beyond trans people.

I'm sorry your parents are being transphobic. I trust you know all this--especially because you said so, yourself--but just a reminder.
Your first sentence gives it away.  Your parents are transphobic and everything they say or do while having this mindset is just going to be to either an effort to turn you straight or hurt you.  Especially anything having to do with your name, identity, or expression.
put your chosen name. i am in my late 20s and have done hiring processes - i barely look at the name when i’m sorting through resumes. especially for a part time job as a teen, you’re totally fine. if a place judges you for that, i promise you don’t want to work there!
Make someone who support you check your CV instead of your parents, and when they think everything is OK apply to the job anyways. Better if they're someone who know about the topic (maybe someone working on human resources?), or if they have knowledge on queer stuff (like my psychologist, yay! :D). Yet better if both. You may have to lie to your parents saying you ""obeyed them"" and used your deadname, but the risk is worth taking imo

&#x200B;

Btw, your parents don't love you. Sorry for being too direct, but the truth must be told. If they did, they would respect your chosen name and pronouns, and make sure you feel supported by them. However, as I always say to queer people with unsupportive families: chosen families can be better than biological ones. Even if it's just internet friends on Discord or the like, find people who support you, who care about you and love you. There are lots of queer servers and chats out there, and if the cyberworld isn't your thing, I'm sure you'll find company in your local queer group
Your chosen name isn't something like ""Moonbeam"", right?
I’ve gone by a name completely different from my given name for my entire adult life. It has never given me a significant problem at work. Schools gave me a hard time sometimes, but I’ve never once been given a hard time with it from a job.
I read once that statistically, shorter names have more success in the workplace. 

If your parents can call someone ""Mrs NewNonMaidenName"" after that person gets married (yes I'm using an old traditional example - the parents are old traditional), they can call you by your chosen name.

Usually it's not that it's difficult, it's that it messes with their tiny minds.
My parents made me cut my hair before getting my green card picture taken and before applying for jobs. I would have my goal-length by today, twice over probably, if it wasn’t for that.

I feel like parents’ reaction to injustice is “just don’t belong to the oppressed group lol,” which is annoyingly pragmatic, but also very invalidating
So my sibling wanted their name to be Ender and I put a stop to that because I do want them to get a job. 

Their name is still very unique but now we can point to our French roots. 

It sounds like your name is an actual name. Many people today have “nicknames” for names- I’ve had mine for 31 years. 

Your parents are wrong.
some job applications actually have a place to put your preferred name. so while some may not like it, others won’t have a problem. just depends on the employer.
If it's any consolation -- my gf (20 & non-binary) applied to a (really good job) with their very stereotypical non-binary noun name and got it with no questions asked. That's not to say people never discriminate based on names, but things are definitely changing for the better
Never ask you parents for resume or career advice. Go to your school counselor or a younger teacher or even a peer who already has a job. 

First, the kind of jobs that you'd be applying for are really struggling to find worker's right now. 

Secondly, most business now ask if you'd like to use a preferred name right on your job application. 

Third, kids your age have ridiculous names! I would know because my daughter is your age and she had a classmate named Moxie in first grade. I knew someone who named their kid Ryder after Rider on the Storm, the Doors song. I've worked at all kind of customer service jobs and come across some really, really awful names. 

TLDR; your parents are wrong and no one is going to care. Apply with your chosen name.
Honestly, I meet cis people all the time who work in a formal setting who have odd sounding names 🙄

It’s very common practice where I live for people of Asian, Indian, Middle Eastern and Slavic descent to have their legal given name, and then a westernised chosen name because it’s “easier” for people to understand. No judgement for the names they chose at all but I have seen everything from Ken and David to Tiara, Noddy, Silver and Strawberry. These have all been people I’ve met in upscale hospitality, office settings and emergency relief.

If cis people with names like these can be not only considered but hired, then you have absolutely nothing to worry about. If the issue they have is with your name then you can rightfully assume they are choosing not to consider you because they’re transphobic or homophobic. I don’t know where you’re from Ofc but if you’re discriminated in this way in Australia, it is in fact illegal. In the end you don’t want to work in that kind of environment anyway.


From what I’ve taken from what you’ve said, I’m sorry to say that it probably won’t matter what name you choose, how you present or what you do, your parents will take issue because of their uneducated bias. 

Hold firm to who you are and remember this is your life to live and not theirs. It may sound harsh but this took me 28 years to learn: if they can’t accept you for who you are, then they don’t deserve to be in your life anymore. For the protection of your own mental health, please consider whether you want this kind of energy around you or not.

I wish you the very best my enby sibling 💜 

Peace, love and jellybeans xx
My full legal name is a nickname for a much longer name. I get asked if it's short for anything all the time, and I just say no. But besides that it's never been an issue at all. So I dont see why youd have any trouble if it's easy to pass as a nickname for a longer name.
Yeah fuck that. Do what you want. Yeah it can make things a bit harder depending on where you are but it can be worth it to not be dead named at work. I know a lot of applications I've done recently had a place for both legal name for tax reasons and a ""nickname or preferred name"" kinda category. And also if you're applying to places like a book store you'll be fine. My bf worked at Barnes and noble for a while even in a relatively conservative town in texas and he said he has almost no cis het coworkers lol.
They’re being bigoted and aren’t in touch. Your name isn’t a problem anywhere else it seems, just to them.
I had a teacher in middle school who went by a completely different name then hers. She just did not really like her name.

On official documents her birth name would show up and everyone would go ""huh? Who is that?"" because literally no one knew lmao.

But honestly, if you are not out and need a reason to why you go by another name just tell them something like ""oh i don't really like my name because it reminds me of something sad / someone that passed away"" or ""oh kids at school used to make fun of me for my name so i don't really like to use it anymore"".
All I got to say is, I got poached on LinkedIn with my first name listed as Jeneni and my pronouns listed as she/they as I’m non-binary transfemme and obviously not afab. You do you!
If it’s a place worth working the name you put on your professional-looking resume isn’t going to make it suddenly “unprofessional.” Cheering you on as you apply!!
Just want to chime in as someone with an unusual chosen name that I got a job with no issues. My name never came up - my employer was more concerned about my skills. I had a legal name change by then but they gave me the job before I sent any legal documents (and HR handles that anyway so thankfully no one in my department has seen my birth certificate). The funny thing is, even though my last name is more like a first name which I thought would be a dead give away, I still get asked ""How did your parents come up with your name?""
We were told in one of my classes that nothing relating to gender should be put on my resume. I put it on there anyway because it lets companies self-filter. If you have a problem with me being non-binary I don't wanna work for you anyway.
Let's take the practical approach: e.g. : Legal / registered / official passport  name is Nicholas. But please call me Nicky when at work.

Perfectly simple and  keeps it all largely in the middle. If someone has a problem with that you keep it simple by asking why. And if they answer - whatever answer- you keep on asking why. Un-arm any army with asking - . > WHY < ?
my heart goes out to you and i totally support your decision with the chosen name! it’s your life, your cv and your decisions regarding it!
I have my now legal name on my resume, and it does not always match the perception people have of me. I have lost job opportunities because of this, and I have still gotten jobs cause I like to think I have a pretty good resume for my age. If the name is such an issue use a letter abbreviation but honestly, it is not the make or break of getting a job and it will always be more difficult if you are trans. My best advice is to try and connect to those hiring. Bring your resume in mid day when managers are typically out if possible, email the group if that's alowed, make a good impression cause at the end of the day that got me more jobs and interviews then anything else.
yeah i know i have to use my legal name for certain things like that but this is just for how i want to be addressed at the work place, nothing else lol
My go-to solution is (first initial). (Preferred) (Surname)

So like if my birthname was John but my chosen name is Jane, I’d put “J. Jane Doe”.

It makes it clear that there’s a legal first name, but the only name that actually appears anywhere (other than legal things) is the preferred. In my experience, it helps prevent confusion. And it also doesn’t necessarily out you because there could be any number of reasons a person doesn’t go by their legal first name.
This. I put my legal name only on the few documents that absolutely require it. Everything else has my chosen name and no one has ever had a problem with it. If they do, you don’t want to work for them anyway because that would be the beginning of a long line of mistreatment from them.
This is not good advice at all. You don’t know which country this person is from and unfortunately if the work is really necessary. If necessary the name might make a difference and unfortunately people might not hire them for that reason. It would be amazing if people didn’t care about it and respected others for who they are but that’s not the real world.
yeah it all comes down to not wanting to work at a place with people who will treat you differently just because of a name
toe 😭
*accepts mom hug*
""Realistically it will reduce your options"" for a part-time job? Incredibly unlikely. A quarter of Gen Z use they/them pronouns and plenty of people use gender neutral or even opposite gender nicknames who are not trans.
I lived in a very white middle class area for a long time. I moved and got a job in a bigger city, and asked about the dress code because my previous employers had been really strict about it. My manager was like, ""ah, well, you're not allowed to have facial or neck tattoos and can only have facial one piercing, but honestly we're an urban store location so we'll probably overlook it"" LOL
This is the right answer tbh
I'm really, really surprised about how far I had to scroll for this comment. At 16, you're not applying for anything ""formal"" in the slightest; you're applying for retail or food service. They need a warm body manning the register, so they genuinely do not care what you're name is.
no. it's three letters long and if you were to look it up online plenty of other people use it as a nickname.
People go by different names all the time, or middle names, etc. It isn't something that is unique to trans people. Think somebody who goes by Matt, but their name is Matthew, or Mike for Michael. (sorry, these are just examples from my work, off the top of my head, I work in IT, lots and lots of dudes)
I mean, if that's the case, you could introduce yourself like this: ""Hi, my name's (deadname), but I'd really prefer if you called me (nickname)."" (I apologise if this comes off as rude by any chance, I'm rubbish at social interactions)
Great advice.
Well that’s just simply not true.
A quarter...? That alone so baldly, openly wrong that I don't really need to address it. And am not sure why I am, but whatever.

Regardless, even in my extremely aggressively trans-friendly city I receive noticeably fewer responses when I put my pronouns on my job application, so I'm not sure where that's coming from. Ideally you'd be right, and I get the culture in this sub is to be positive, but this person is asking for legitimate advice and society still sucks.
Then it sounds like they're just being disrespectful of who you want to be at the moment and they're trying to keep themselves closeted or in denial.

I'd just put whatever your chosen name is on the CV and only use your legal name for taxes and other legal documents. 

This could also help weed out shitty employers. You don't want to get the job only to realize you're surrounded by bigots.
yeah exactly that's what i was thinking. im not even going to come out at work or anything, im literally just going by a different name to my birth name. that's it
My son's dad has a nickname that isn't even remotely close to his first or middle legal name and only ever goes by that. We worked together for a full year before I knew his legal name was different and we only found out because our boss called him that on the loud speaker intentionally to piss him off. Also a lot of people go by their middle name. My brother actually has a first and two middle names. He's only ever gone by one of his middle names. Plus plenty of Drews who are Andrews, Richs, Dick, Ducks that are Richard, Bills that are Williams. It used to be a common thing for Johns to have Jack as a nickname, etc.
There was a study from the UK that said almost a quarter of Gen Z uses they/them pronouns and half of Gen Z includes their pronouns in things like email signatures. That doesn't mean 1/4 of people are non-binary, because this would include people who are cis who use they/he, they/she and any/all pronouns. However that is still a really large number of people.
It's been widely reported in the [media,](https://www.joe.co.uk/life/nearly-a-quarter-of-gen-z-now-identify-using-a-non-gendered-pronoun-such-as-they-them-study-finds-390943) the study was performed in the UK. I can't find an original source for it but my daughter is Gen Z and a lot of her friends are trans or non-binary. There are a lot of people who use they/he, they/she and any/all pronouns that would be part of that.

The OP didn't even say anything about putting their pronouns on their resume, they asked about putting a chosen name on their resume which is super common for people of all genders and doesn't even necessarily indicate that they are trans or non-binary. 

The culture in this sub often isn't positive and what is irritating to me is a lot of us don't have the privilege of being able to hide our identities.
Terrible example I know, but if Newt Gingrich could be taken seriously, I cannot imagine any nickname you could pick that would do what ‘newt’ could not and unserious you out of the work force. 

(I hope the name you go by is not newt. But [newts](https://www.britannica.com/animal/newt) are cool. I like newts. They didn’t deserve Gingrich.)
You are going to need to link this study. What’s the sample size? That doesn’t match up with peoples real life experience.
Oh yes, JOE, a ""social media publisher,"" citing ""a study"" without in any way linking to it, saying who did it, where it was published, why is valid, whatever. You might as well say ""my uncle Joe said it and he's a scientist and has gay friends."" Friendly media like JOE is less likely to actively try to hurt us, but that's not the same as being about to just assume anything they ever publish is true.

And to be clear, I don't have that privilege either. Getting the interview does seem to be more difficult than getting through it, though, at least in my experience, and my birth name is also my real name and is gender neutral by means of obscurity, so via pronouns on my resume are really the only point of reference that I have. I came out before I entered professional life so I can't use that as my point of comparison, and I've always had my current name so I can't use that either. We can pretty easily infer that their chosen name would be a tell that they're nonbinary, or they wouldn't be asking this question, and obviously-nonbinary pronouns are an effective proxy in this case. I think you already knew that, though.
The study was in the UK can had over 2000 participants.
No I think you're just a negative and sad person who wants everyone else to be negative and sad too.
Again, link please.
lol, okay.

Lol		"Even if that was the case, intersex people didn't exist, and we try to take this transphobe somewhat serious ... how would choosing to ""make another identity"" that's generally misunderstood, hated or just not acknowledged, working for making my life less shitty? It's hard to argue against people who don't make sense in the first place ...
Does this even make sense? I literally don’t get what this clown is saying lol? How am I making something up because I’m “unhappy,” (I’m not). Like this person literally assumed something about every trans person like it meant something and I really don’t understand what they’re talking about. Could someone elaborate?
""you are just unhappy with your current life and instead of improving it you're just making up a new identity"" this person doesn't understand that trans people ARE improving their life by transitioning. They want people to improve their lives and then dismisses them because they're doing exactly that. Transphopes really can't not contradict themselves smh
I am so fucking sick of binaries. Like look if you cant wrap your brain around complex thought that's on you, but stop trying to force me to live your simplistic world veiw.
I mean if you consider 1 to 2 percent of the entire population insignificant…..  just millions and millions of people
Even if it is a choice like they are describing, why does it matter? Let people live, just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it isn't valid. I don't understand gravity but my feet stay on the ground...
Ah yes, so the fact that I stopped being depressed when I found out my problem was gender disphoria and I wasn't just insane for no reason, which literally obviously improved my life, is me trying to build up a new identity instead of trying to improve my life. This makes total sense.
How tf didn’t they get downvoted?
it's funny too because i think depending on where you are, a large majority actually agrees with this person. like they whine and complain about trans people when people literally want to take away our rights and protections, kick us out of schools, and even kill us.
‘Insignificant minority’ is millions of people worldwide. Probably more than we even know of. What kind of bullshit answer is that
so like almost 50 million is insignificant?
r/confidentlyincorrect
The irony of OP's opinion is that making a new identity is often a good way to improve your life, trans or otherwise. ""Focus on who you want to be"" is pretty common self-improvement advice. Getting yourself out of a rut often involves giving up parts of who you are so that you have the room to make big changes. 

&#x200B;

In that regard, this is yet another cis person complaining about trans people doing something that cis people do all the time.
But how is it so high? :(
This person doesn't make sense, here's something that does. Anyone who thinks like the bozo  up there is an uncultured swine.
Oh my god people are actually ridiculous
there’s more intersex people than people with red hair. but when you’re asked your hair colour, red is always an option.
“unhappy with your current life” YES MF I AM, now let me fake my death like every movie villain and make a new life for myself
Yet another ignorant byproduct of sex & gender being viewed as one and the same.
the classic ""i am going to ignore this point that completly destroys my argument because shush""
Wow that last commenter showing how they feel about not just trans people but also races, disabled people, and just about everything else because apparently minorities “don’t matter”
Aye, it's official, many people disagree lol
If we lived life by the “minority’s don’t matter,” logic, then no one would even talk about racism. Just because a group is small does not mean that their existence is insignificant. 

Also, when it comes to intersex people, we are talking about a general biological concept. The phrase is “sex is diverse,” is not dependent on how many intersex people there are.
[Atoms other than hydrogen and helium are an insignificant minority](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/tz8gpn/i_love_this_one/) and shouldn't be involved in this argument. Stop bothering me, you cloud of hydrogen and helium!
I'd hit this dumbass with a ""So you think that minorities are insignificant?"" It's pretty easy to make these idiots openly admit how bigoted they are and the cherry on top would be successfully reporting them for hate (if they share their bigoted views in a direct manner so that reddit actually takes action against them)
“insignificant minorities “ BRO THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE
Please gimme that hot phobia trigger warning and mark nsfw if you don't mind I don't need to read this hot trash today.
weird, because i’m really happy with my life and do stuff to improve it while being agender. who would’ve guessed?
Well yea, youre unhappy with your current life, so you make changes to become happier with yourself. If you weren't being proactive you would continue sticking to social expectations that make you unhappy. Live your life freely.
Cis people explaining trans experience, ah the classic
I’m am very content with my life and yes I identify as male now, however going through the process of figuring out who I am, I was non-binary and a part of me still is, once I reach the age of being able to start my transition I want to remove my breasts but I do not want a penis if that makes sense, but just cause there are 2 forms of SEX (I mean with biological genes) does not mean there are only 2 GENDERS
What's insignificant is this troll's opinion 🚮
i absolutely love it when homophobes say ""its not natural"" and ""its against gods will"" when homosexuality has been observed in over 5000 intelligent species
Wait til that person learns they’re literally believing something that’s been scientifically disproven.
It’s odd how these phobes claim “you’re just unhappy with your life!” Well no shit genius. That’s exactly why I’m doing what I’m doing. Then they get all offended that you’re actually taking steps to BE a happy human being.
They're just transphobic, that's it lol
Like the other reply said, they're just transphobic.  They've invented a worldview that let's them dismiss anything positive they hear from or about trans people so they don't have to examine their prejudices and possibly adjust their ideas.
This person didn't like trans people. So they created a narrative about trans people that let them feel feel justified in their preconceived notions.
Literally like I realised I was trans at age 14 but I didn't understand what being nonbinary meant so I went back to trying to be cis cus i though ""oh I'm just insecure and/or edgy"" . I tried to work on myself for fucking 4 YEARS. ALMOST 5. then I was like naw. I'm not happy and went back to accepting myself as trans and got way happier . People think it's easy to just be like ""I have problems, I'm probably trans"" when tons of people struggle for so long to try to reason and find ways to not be trans before accepting it.
It's not even that complex though. Even my nephew has understood for years that his unctie isn't a boy or a girl. He's six.
people with green eyes and people with red hair \[both \~2%\] don't exist according to this person lmao
It's also most likely more than this. Plenty of people believe they are cisgender and never received any kind of ""genital reconstruction"" but chromosomally or hormonally they may be intersex. There's also plenty of people who have internal organs that they're entirely unaware of, but that's easier to notice than a chromosomal thing.
Literally more intersex people than Australian people. Are Australians an “insignificant minority”? Methinks not.
I thought I was depressed for no reason for about 5-6 years before I realized I was just not cis and yeah I’ve been happier but I also literally got kicked out and had to come to another state that I’d never been to before to avoid being homeless but yeah sure I just “made up a new identity”. Technically speaking my life is worse but my mental health is definitely better
The same way Republicans get into many public offices.  Conservatives vote reliably, no matter how shitty their candidate is, and many liberals get complacent and don't bother because they assume their side already won....*because the other guy is really shitty.*

IOW:  More assholes upvoted.
This 100%.
yep and they stick to that false narrative rather than trying to understand us.
Pretty much ""Trans people make me uncomfortable,  it must mean that they're crazy and now I'm going to bury that thought as deeply as I can so that I don't think about it anymore. ""
At least 24 years of ""working on myself"" for me, mate (teenage me wished I was a boy and was so deeply uncomfortable in my body - I knew, we just had next to no concepts of trans identity back in suburbia then). Went through every conceivable therapy and side quest and did literally any/everything else I could before trying to transition. And even now that it's working and I feel great I also hid for so long that while most of me is delighted, a small part of me is still like, wellp, reallllly was hoping it was not this because that's embarrassing that I waited so long.
Oh they exist, they're just ""insignificant"" apparently  so we can pretend they don't exist when we say things and no one should call us out on it. ::eyeroll::
Oh yeah this reminded me of a greys anatomy episode where a patient found out they had testicles and almost didn’t find out bc their parents tried telling them they had a mass on their ovary(when it was on their testicle) but the doctor told them and they got so excited and was like “wait does that mean I can be a boy if I want to?!” And the parents were pissed but fuck them lol
Well according to flat earthers Australia isn’t real
I'm so sorry that this happened to you! That's totally crazy! Mental health is really important though and I'm happy that it's better.
that’s what i thought of!

Capitalism is Incompatible with Non-Binary Identities and Gender Abolition	"Capitalism absorbs and commodies every subculture. Look at the punk aesthetic, which is all about rebellion and resistance, which is now its own store at the mall.

Non-binary identities and gender abolition are about the erasure of categories that can be easily commodified. I don't want to shop in the men's or women's section; I want to go to the clothes and buy something that's cute and fits. But capitalism's attempt to fully commodify me means it needs to fit me into a box. 

As non-binary identity becomes more and more commodified, you will see a set of stereotypes emerge that will become the single new non-binary style. We will see a lot less of, ""You don't need to dress any particular way to be non-binary,"" to a common aesthetic with its own market and preferred providers who meet the new niche. This subculture will be resisted by the dominant culture until it becomes a way it can be commodified, at which point we will not be non-binary any more, but instead just a third gender to be marketed to in new and ""hipper"" ways."	"My experience is this is already happening. In the few clothing stores I've seen that offer a ""gender-neutral"" or ""unisex"" range, the clothing in those categories is very much geared towards a specific androgynous style.

I don't hate the style, but I hate this behaviour.

Edit: corrected spelling.
I agree. No ethical consumption under capitalism even in alt sub cultures.
But. Alt subcultures like punk especially developed because those people couldn't afford anything else so they had to get creative. Now 2 generations later people still can't afford anything else so where else are they going to get their clothing but cheap crap online retailers like cider and shein. Queer people are more broke than ever but if there's a way they can still express their core identities for very little money then they're also free to do that because what else can they afford.

You are totally right in order for capitalism to function it requires an ""ideal"" to work for and an ""other"" to discriminate against all the while selling you the stereotypes of both.
Capitalism is incompatible with life in general
Capitalism is incompatible with the human experience, it’s core is exploitation
My dyslexic ass read the first word as ""cannibalism"" and I'm like, that doesn't know a gender, does it?
Agreed.  Capitalism and Patriarchy always attempts to co-opt revolution and slot into a place where it become profitable and controllable.
I’ve felt for a long time you cannot truly be for liberation of ANY oppressed/marginalized group without being anti-capitalist.
There's a great article about this by Marcella Althaus Reid. Capitalism reinforces norms that benefit cis gender white men. Non binary folk challenge this norm and are a threat to the system.
Idk, I think it's possible for clothes to be sold without gender. Just like how kids' toys are much less gendered than they used to be, clothes could also have a market without relying on gender. Clothes are still gendered because of culture. Culture will decide what the stereotypical non-binary aesthetic is, not capitalism.

Non-binary can (and probably will) become a commodified fashion aesthetic but that's not really the fault of capitalism. Even in a hypothetical society where everything was free, I'd expect there to be a group of people who want to fit in by wearing a particular aesthetic
Working in capitalism is incompatible too. I look mainly stereotypically feminine. But my mannerisms, thoughts, speech, etc are more masculine. So I piss people off at work a lot. People don’t know what to do with me. Am I supposed to be meek like a proper professional woman? Or am I supposed to have a backbone like the strong professional man? 

So I’m always at odds with various people who expect me to be something other than I am. 

Everyone says “you gotta play the game in corporate America”

But they also say “be yourself”. 

But I can’t be myself and play the game. 

It blows.
capitalism is incompatible with humanity as a whole
Give it time, they'll try to sell it to us
It's already happening. Companies have started making ""gender-free"" ""gender neutral"" options in addition to men's and women's sections that are not any different than men's clothes. There are specific clothes heavily marketed towards trans people - which normally I'm ok with because sometimes they are actually designed with different goals in mind - however some stuff is almost identical to regular clothing and they are extremally overpriced for what they actually are. I'm guessing in the future pushing the idea that one must get rid of all their gendered items and get almost identical gender neutral options will be pushed by companies - instead of them just de-gendering all products.
Capitalism is the idea that, if there is a spigot with money coming out, somebody will put a bucket under it. 

And then they will defend that bucket to the death!

If there is a market for ""non-binary"" clothing, somebody will try to fill it. And somebody else will probably try to follow them and steal their market. The imitation will become a style, and some people will mistake the combination of terminology and style for a definition of identity, either for others, or for themselves.

As I am always pointing out, terminology is a tool that we can use to describe the way we are, not a mold for us to pour our identities into. Too many people asking ""Am I trans enough?"" ""If I'm non-binary, is it ok for me to do X?"" 

Just be you. 

Don't let anybody else define you. 

Whether that is a thread on Reddit, a book by a noted scholar, or the Hot Topic clothing store.

Capitalism will capitalize. You get to choose whether to buy what they are selling. 

Especially when what they are selling is identity...
Totally agree
I think you intended to talk about _consumerism_, not capitalism. Capitalism would encourage a wide variety of options for the most amount of sales. But you are very right that as subcultures become more accepted in society, consumerist markets determine what products are offered by tailoring the illusion of choice with sprinkles of niche aesthetics. Once they concede that a unisex option is required, they will agree to sell this ‘third gender’, but not offer a truly unisex shopping experience for anyone to access products that work for them.
People shouldn't need to have a certain opinion on economy for their identity to be valid. Economy is complex and people should have time to think about it in peace and inform themselves about how capitalism and other systems affect different people. Saying it isn't compatible with non-binary identities restricts that or gender exploration/discovery or both and doesn't benefit anyone.

I see problems with capitalism but I also see problems in all other system I know. I still have to do research and I have no clue what's best at the moment and maybe I never will. I do know I'm non-binary though.

We should welcome all non-binary people in this community no matter what they think about the economy (or other topics that are not directly related to being non-binary) as long as they're not queerphobic/racist/etc.
Homophobia is incompatible with non binary identities not capitalism
If society wanted more (true and diverse!) ""unisex"" clothes in stores and less sepration then I think capitalism would pick up on that. I feel like the main problem is that most people are comftable in the system, and capitalism follows what the paying majority wants.

Capitalism did help spark some separation, stereotypes and stigma tho, so it certainly doesn't help.

Edit: and most will absolutely avoid things that could potentially make karens angry, so no nice things for us anyway. Imagine being able to buy a binder in any regular store - even if that was profitable - not gonna happen.

> We will not be non-binary any more, but instead just a third gender to be marketed to in new and ""hipper"" ways.

""A third gender"" is perfectly compatible with ""non-binary"", and as far as I know plenty of people under the ""non-binary"" umbrella already identify that way. And as far as I know plenty of people under the ""non-binary"" umbrella aren't strong proponents of gender abolition either.

Also I don't think the concept of a non-binary gender identity is quite so fragile that commodification of a subculture associated with that identity makes people not be that thing anymore.

Like, if we're complaining about the eternal treadmill of all things into shallow ""hip"" garbage, the equation of ""identity"" with ""subculture"" is a big step in that direction, so maybe let's hold off on that. Punk is a subculture. ""Non-binary"" isn't.

(And if you're already taking that step, then it's not clear to me that anti-capitalism has a chance of saving you.)

If I had to list some things subculture membership pressures me into via ""hipness"", I'd put hating capitalism pretty high. ""You don't need to dress any particular way to be non-binary, you just need to weave anti-capitalism into your identity."" Neither the consumerist hell-machine telling me I have to dress a certain way nor the rebels telling me I have to feel a certain way about capitalism are welcome to lean on my gender to tell me these things.
Kinda like the Borg if you will a desire to catalogue dynamic things in to a flat static manipulable data set....skinning the culture and using the culture vulture influencers to hawke the latest on the fashion runaway. It's what they want, to skin the good bits and parade around in a safe facsimile without ever engaging the ugliness that gave birth to it.  


  
I suppose I always thought of non-binary to myself as an intermediate word due to the willfully under developed language surrounding it in english, I was kinda hoping folks from cultures may be willing to share gender relationship perspectives.  


Maybe if it's left as a set of relationships to ones emotional sense of self and those you interact with with descriptors coming in to being as needs dictate, a sort of waivering language.  


I wish they'd stop culturally A\*\*\*ing every attempt to cultivate any sort alternative resource allocation models. See those who use the word cuck with a guttoral contempt. it's a bit of a projection imho, how they see themselves and their relationship to societies resources and to bully out everyone else.  


I wish I had a better answer than to make emotional intelligence and empathy an educational priority. Needs a lot of mum energy.
Capitalism kills
Cis gender straight white man
When they say ""be yourself"" they mean ""buy this product so you can be your true self"" I guess ;(
Exactly this. They can add a huge markup to completely regular clothes, just like how you can also buy biological food for huge markups. Or clothes that are supposedly better for the world in some way. Etc.
I agree with your point, although I'd argue that consumerism is a direct consequence of capitalism.
I feel like this post was commentary on what companies will do with their products and advertising and not a personal attack towards non-binary people. It's not saying you cant identify with being non-binary and like capitalism.
Your identity can be valid and you can also believe things that hurt people who share your identity.
Homophobia is a product of imperialism, i.e. capitalism.
have you ever heard of market socialism? worker cooperatives are an example of this where everyone who works there gets a share of the company and gets a vote on how the business is run.
you can't be a capitalist unless you actually own capital, you can advocate for capitalism without having any capital though.
The word you're looking for is ""class traitor.""
Yes, thanks for that edit!
I don't think it was an attack on nonbinary people, since OP hasn't said anything queerphobic.

However, I do feel pressure from the online queer community in general to have a certain opinion on the topic. You can see that the only person in this comment section who has said that they like capitalism got downvoted. This stresses me, since I don't understand the topic and I would like to have a space where my identity is accepted and I can explore other ideas without getting judged immetiately (as long as I'm not queerphobic/racist/sexist/ableist/etc. of course). I don't want to be pressured into other boxes in the only space where I don't have to fit into the gender boxes.

Maybe OP is doing exactly that, just exploring ideas and sharing their thoughts. I do think they have good points and it's an interesting topic to discuss, but I also think we need to be careful about the distinction between our identity and our opinions or the issues that our community faces.
That's true.

Capitalism isn't queerphobia though, it doesn't affect nonbinary identities as directly as queerphobia does. Capitalism affects everybody (although not everybody in the same way), just like every other economic system. Other systems could hurt nonbinary people too. We should get to question what's best and consider all options, including the one that capitalism isn't worse than everything else.

I think it's good that this topic is talked about and it's important to point out how capitalism affects nonbinary people. However, saying that capitalism is inherently incompatible with nonbinary identities isn't the same as saying that capitalism affects nonbinary people negatively. It's saying that you can't be nonbinary in a capitalist system or that you can't be nonbinary and capitalist. This is not true and in my opinion bad for nonbinary people because it makes them shut up about important questions that should be asked and discussed.
Homophobia is more like a by-product of class relations and imperialism than strongly caused. Unfortunately, you could still have an anarchist, socialist or even communist society and still have homophobia and queerphobia.

(Also, colonialism =/= capitalism, it predates it but they make each other a heck of a lot worse!)
But I have capital not a lot but I have it.
Nuances are hard to talk about, I think. In part because our language is fuzzy and I may not understand the same thing that you were trying to say. 

I think it's important to explore and understand (and be able to talk about) ideas and their nuances, otherwise we don't really know if we're criticizing the same thing. And that will probably alienate other people who are also just trying to explore and understand.

I'm usually on the side of ""capitalism bad"" but it's also more complicated than that. What we think of as ""capitalism"" is only one form of it. ""Neoliberalism"" is a better term for the system/ideology we live under now, and deals a bit more with the specific commodification of ideas, identities, and human relationships in general.
Capitalism adds to dehumanization though, so it is indeed queerphobic, because capitalism demands that cis binary sex and straight marriage be the basis of society since capitalism needs more and more young people to explore, and throw them in the trash when they get old and ""useless"". I think one cannot stand up for human rights and capitalism at the same time, those are mutually exclusive.
being a capitalist also means that you own the means of production (eg. factories, farms, workplaces) and that you don't have to sell your labor to survive.
I agree that capitalism in it's pure form, without any restrictions and protection of workers/minorities etc. is not a good system because of the exploitation that you mentioned.   
At the same time, capitalism is an efficient system because it produces what is demanded and not what some authority says.  
I think we have to find some middle way between capitalism and something else to have an economic system that is as efficient as possible while still being accepitng of minority groups and having good working conditions.

Completely off topic but this post reminded me of how sad the story is of the author of ""I Sexually Identify As An Attack Helicopter.""

[https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22543858/isabel-fall-attack-helicopter)

tldr, Isabel Fall was a transwoman writing about her experience using a popular copypasta and was bullied and harrassed so bad by her own community that she ended up checking herself into a psychiatric facility and ultimately decided to halt her transition.
I really hate the word cishet. It just reminds me of fishnet. I didn’t add any sort of support to this post lol, sorry.
It’s transphobic for sure. I had a client do this and I just treated it like they were serious.
>Again, reddit does not accept transphobic comments like ""I identify as a helicopter"" as hate speech.




I just recently accidentally (because I know they won't do shit about it, it was supposed to go to the mods of the subreddit) reported a really transmisogynistic comment to the admins and just got an email that said it didn't violate their hate speech BS rules. It absolutely did, but of course they don't give a shit about trans people. 


I live in Michigan and it's a hell hole unless you're in a few good pockets. Detroit area, Grand Rapids area, uh, that's actually probably it, honestly.
Have you checked out r/onejoke? It’s a place to bond over how terrible the “I identify as…” “jokes” are
Reddit is not anything like a decent spot for that; its format is aimed directly at libertarian attitudes about zero censorship and accountability. This is not the right place to ever expect decency from.
Honestly, I've never really found a problem with it. Even I, a demigirl, make those jokes sometimes. Of course, it all depends on the context, and everyone is entitled to their opinion.
While it's annoying I'm not sure if I'd call it transphobic. 

Some of the same people who've made the same jokes have been my biggest advocates. 

On the other hand some sjw and LGBT people have been very toxic to me. 

I'm not interacting with these individuals one on one- but I'll take your word for it. 

For me transphobia has included- being called a freak. Reject job applications when using my preferred name. Delays and discrimination in medical care or complete lack of. Discrimination and harassment on jobs from coworkers/higher ups/HR. Lost friendships and family maybe for the better. Physical harassment. Strangers are scared of me. 

I sincerely hope you find a safer and better community and workplace if not- make one.
maybe I'm just on a different wavelength but I don't understand how this is invalidating or frustrating at all. why do you care how other people identify even if it's a silly identity? even if it's a parody? why does that matter?

My NB identity is for me, it's how I see myself and understand the world. I dont see why on earth id waste my time getting annoyed that other people are pointing out the absurdity of binary gender and how superfluous it all is by making an admittedly silly and stupid joke.

I can't say I find that joke funny persay but still, hate speech? seems harsh. I just don't understand the anger here at all. I would not feel very comfortable around OP I don't think, it sounds like their gender experience is very rigid and judgemental compared to mine
This isn't a silver bullet of a fix, but sometimes it's more helpful to describe it as identifying *with* a gender rather than identifying *as* a gender. It's pretty common to identify *with* characters in media, so even the ignorant can understand the vibe of what I'm saying when I say I don't really identify with other men.
That's what I do or say ""we are here to focus on you medical thingy. We can talk about gender I'll happily sit here and talk about the non binary spectrum all damn day. Or I can help you. Do you want my help? Good what is your gender?"" Or I'm really not in the mood I just sit in silence. The longer one if the people who go on s very long tangent about god or some shit. A lot of the time I just stay quiet and let them be awkward on their own and give them an ah huh a la kuzco style if they don't answer the question after a good long awkward silence.

The worst is the people defending these assholes though.
I vote for this response every single time! Sorry you're having to deal with all these shitty people OP 💗
Exactpy what I was thinking. Anything that isn't exclusively male or female is non-binary. Even if it's a helicopter.
Oh no I love it I'm just imagining Cishet bigots being mad because we are calling them out on secretly wearing fishnet tights 24/7.
I don't live there but I work with the worst of them. I take calls from there. I know how shit they are. I'm sorry you have to live with them.
Right this is a case where it's fine when we do it around our own people as a joke because we know we actually support neopronouns and gender identities. But when someone jumps in and says it when they don't support it, that's not ok. It's kind of like using the f slur, people in LGBTQ spaces use it with each other in some cases but you absolutely do not use it as a Cishet. This at least was what was happening in those spaces like 6 years ago but I don't know how common that allegory is now. Attack helicopter is the new f slur?
I’d say it’s a transphobic micro-aggression
I think the down votes on my comment make my 3rd paragraphs point very well.
 > annoyed that other people are pointing out the absurdity of binary gender and how superfluous it all is

When cis people go for the helicopter joke, they are not doing it to point out the absurdity of binary gender.

They are doing it to dehumanize people whose experience of gender is different from theirs, and to point out the absurdity of people who want to live as themselves without having their gender mocked. 

This OneJoke is a recruiting tool to convince other people not to take us and our needs seriously, and to dismiss us as attention-grabby and ridiculous when we ask to use restrooms appropriate to our identity, ask that people call us by our real names, ask not to be discriminated against in housing & employment, and ask to have competent healthcare that understands our actual needs.

On its own, in a vacuum, a joke about identifying as a helicopter or whatever is no big deal. But we don't live in a vacuum, the jokester doesn't say this in a vacuum, the audience doesn't receive the joke in a vacuum, and the people at whose expense the joke is made aren't subjected to the joke in a vacuum. The context adds meaning and power to the joke, and the persistent impact of this joke continuing to be dismissed as no big deal is to ignore the harm it contributes to a marginalized demographic. 

OP doesn't have to have a ""very rigid and judgemental gender experience"" for endless iterations of this joke to be annoying, even infuriating, instead of funny.

All that said, I identify as a boundless vacuum and will irresistibly suck the fun out of a playful attempt to pass hatespeech off as harmless jest.
Right but this was a transphobe being cruel to non binary and xenogender identities which isn't ok.
You could also just pretend to treat their initial answer as if it was serious so they have to say something or have it left like that
So true. I like the wording of asking them what the mean, like, ""What? A helicopter? I don't get it! Can you please explain?"" because it forces them to actually look at the mechanics of their joke and hopefully feel embarrassed about it.
Call them fishnet cishets so they get confused then

“What??”
It's all perspective of the receiver. If OP found it offensive- yes. 100%. 

Would I take it that way? Nah. Reasoning above. 

Some people will use my name and pronouns and minute my back is turned not do so thinking I can't hear it. 

Yet- same people who've made same joke above always respected my name and identity- even when I'm not present. One even encouraged me to embrace who I am. 

Strangers will make tactless hurtful comments. The more you get to know someone they may not be phobic just uninformed- and the most PC person can be a secret bigot.
No joke a guy laughed and said he is a lesbian as a joke so I went ahead and put that for his sexual orientation and made absolutely certain that he got a packet that discussed demographic targeting of LGBTQ people in the tobacco industry.
I called a kid Batman for an entire school year because he thought I was bluffing when I said I'd use preferred names, even if students changed their minds/requested something ""silly"".
“I identify as a helicopter/tiger/whatever” 
“I’m sorry, then, sir this is a hospital not a repair shop/vet/etc. We cannot help you.”

Or even better: “This is a hospital but you’re in luck, we have very capable doctors here who also know about helicopters/animals will gladly take you apart and decide whether it’s worth fixing you or if you’re a write off and will be disassembled and sold for parts/put down”
Then loom closer while T posing to assert dominance. Don't forget to use tassel pasties when making your exit to helicopter away while slapping your own ass
Yes but if they were just uninformed and ended up supporting you then I assume they stopped making these jokes? I think the situation with OP is a little different since it sounds like OP's having only brief interactions with strangers and trying to educate them probably is impractical. But it's good to know that even if someone makes these jokes there may be hope for them to come around.
I fucking love you.
Wait… the tobacco industry targets the community for potential buyers and users?
Honestly, this was the right way to handle it. Not your job to guess whether they actually mean their answers.
This is exactly what I was going to suggest!
Not gonna lie that’s actually kinda funny and cute.
Confusion is the best defense, and in some cases offense. I watched Ten Rings the other day and some girl in there would start singing song lyrics and dancing when an enemy wanted to fight them. It made them pause and gave the girl time to escape.
Same as the alcohol industry...

We are having higher rates of most mental health indicators...
Socio economic stuff...

Which leads to higher rates of alcohol and drug use...
(Which is why I - regular rainbow capitalism concerns aside - personally have quite big issues with alcohol companies sponsoring pride parades....)
The tobacco industry will target _anyone_ they can, to be fair. The old advertisements for cigarettes influenced a significant amount of advertising techniques still used today.

Knowing Better has a really interesting (but long lol) video on this [here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GMOyNgLSX2g).

He did say toward the end of the year that it was fun to start over as Batman and not be the same Birthname Kid he'd always been. Pretty sure he was a cis lad and would contentedly be a dude for life, but still had a good time with a new name.

Woah! Spoiler! I haven't seen that yet!
I dated someone who had one of those “Celebrate Diversity” bumper stickers that is rainbow colored alcoholic drinks. Took me a couple months before I told them how much I hated it and how it’s not really supporting the community at all.

Edit: [an eBay link to the sticker](https://www.ebay.com/itm/362492746578) so you know what I’m talking about.
… well god damn that explains a lot in my personal life but also things in general
Major factors overlapping each other. I could help a trans girl with her quit and when it comes to asking about mental health conditions she could tell me she only has gender dysphoria which isn't a listed condition I can mark for the question. It's rare to find someone LGBTQ in my line of work that doesn't suffer from an anxiety or depression disorder but they are certainly out there.
Holy hell that's fucked up on so many levels.
Yeah, even the cis sometimes change their name. My youngest brother chaanged his, because he never managed to identify with his given name I also know a cis woman who changed hers because she did not want to he associated with anything to do with who she was named after.

And fun fact, both have the same struggles with making family start using the new name. Being deadnamed is not a trans/nb exclusive experience as far as I have observed. And it hurts the cis just as much, for not being accepted as who they try to signal that they are (or are not). Though there's less of the added lack ofbrespect for gender identity.

About Demi Lovato...	"Just heard she changed her pronouns back to she/her after a year of being nonbinary. She said she just wants to feel human, and that recently she's been feeling more feminine again.

Help me figure out why this feels disrespectful to the community. Or am I being disrespectful by questioning why she flipped back?


Edit: Thank you lovely humans! I appreciate that people are allowed to try things and find out what is and isn't for them. I guess even high list celebrities struggle with gender identity and have to move through their truth to find it."	"She didn’t change them back. She simply added them to the existing pronouns she wanted to go by. Plenty of non-binary people go by she/they.
People are allowed to try things. If no one ever questioned their gender, these subs would be empty and we'd all still be miserable believing there were no other options. I think everyone should take a good hard look at their gender and make sure they're not just doing what they're ""supposed to do."" And if they look at it and go, ""yep, I'm cis"" at least they had Thoughts.

Now I don't know anything about Demi Lovato, the name is familiar but I couldn't pick her out of a line up or tell you what she's a celebrity for. Even if I could, I don't know her motivation or read her mind (and neither can anyone else) so I'm gonna assume she was genuinely questioning. This ""just a fad"" rhetoric is going to hurt everyone in the long run
She didn’t do anything. Experimenting with your gender should be encouraged to help relieve the stigma. I’m not sure how her journey with gender affects anyone but herself tbh.
To be fair she might still be nonbinary, but just... feeling more feminine and using she/her?
I did this a handful of times before realising I was just genderfluid
She uses she/they now according to her instagram bio, so she hasn’t exclusively changed pronouns back to she/her.  Regardless, I think people should be able to explore gender identities to figure out what makes them most comfortable even if they end up coming to the conclusion that they’re cis
Nonbinary people don’t *have* to use they/them pronouns.

Also let’s not forget that her overdose from a few years back along with the years of substance abuse beforehand caused permanent brain damage. Her behavior and thought patterns and even her personality changed substantially as a result of that.
It would be nice to also put in the main post that they actually still go by they/them along with she/her, and saying they ""flipped back"" is misinformation and probably damaging.
I feel like it could be disrespectful if we make it be. if we got mad at everything someone worded wrong we wouldn't get anywhere imo.
Like yea ""feel human"" could've been said differently, but there's nothing wrong with realizing that you aren't nonbinary or trans after trying to see if you were.

If we gatekeep the chance for people to figure themselves out in a supposedly safe environment, we'd be just like the transmedicalist who don't deserve to speak or have a platform.

But we all feel different about different things.
As a non binary person who goes by - and feels right being referred to as the pronouns that were assigned to me - I get where she is coming from. There is no correct way to be non binary and if we can’t change our minds or be the ones in charge of our own identity then what is the point
I can’t tell you how it feels to the community because I’m not the entire community and neither you nor I speak for everyone in it. That’s your gut reaction and it’s for you to analyse.

I used to think I was a binary trans woman until two years on Hrt and realized I’m non binary and have fluid presentation I just didn’t want an obvious masculine body. Does that mean I shat on and disrespected every trans woman who ever lived in spite of how sincere I was about my dysphoria and how I felt best described me at the time? No
I felt off about it too, but I realized my feeling isn't even about Demi. I just heavily dislike how any time a trans or questioning celebrity does anything public, it gets taken as representative of our entire community and then people assume we are all like that. Demi didn't do anything wrong by exploring her identity and my issue is with the culture, not her or other individuals in her position
The pronouns in their bio are “they/them/she/her.” Plenty of nonbinary folks use multiple sets of pronouns, and plenty feel “more masculine” or “more feminine” without it meaning they’re whatever binary gender is most commonly associated with those traits (same goes for feminine guys and masculine ladies, presentation doesn’t necessarily equal identity!). She’s allowed to explore their identity, and just because one of the sets of pronouns a person uses aligns with their AGAB it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re cis.
She may be  genderfluid. Tbh she’s still exploring like me. It’s fine . There is no reason why she shouldn’t be seeking .
Even if she did decide she isn’t NB isn’t that ok too? Not everyone is CIS/NB/Trans/etc. and some people need to explore a little bit to discover that .
its okay to experiment with your identity, she can be whatever the hell she wants and it's not disrespectful or any of our business. if she said something like ""nevermind nonbinary people aren't real im a girl again"" that would be disrespectful, but changing your gender identity isn't disrespectful at all.
Genderfluid people exist
Non-binary people can also still use binary pronouns and still be valid as non-binary
OP, do you just get off on lying about trans people or something?

[""It's also like I'm such a fluid person when it comes to my gender, my sexuality, my music, my creativity.""](https://spoutpodcast.sounder.fm/episode/demi-lovato)

And in the same podcast, from Demi themselves;

""I've actually adopted the pronouns of she her again. So for me, I'm such a fluid person that I don't really I don't find that I am. I felt like, especially last year, my energy was balanced and my masculine and feminine energy \[...\] I didn't feel necessarily like a woman, I didn't feel like a man Um, I just felt like a human and that's what they them is about. For me, is just about like feeling human at your core. Recently I've been feeling more feminine and so I've adopted her again. But I think what's important is, like, nobody's perfect.""

[She still goes by they/them, but *also* uses she/her](https://www.instagram.com/ddlovato/?hl=en). Just like plenty other nonbinary people do.
Can you imagine the lack of certainty in discovering your gender identity, only in the public eye? Like, don't get me wrong, Demi Lovato is out there, singing to ghosts and stuff. But, my personal experience as someone freshly out as non-binary is that I'm still not certain about what pronouns I'm cool with. Cut them a break, sometimes you don't know what your pronouns are until you experiment with them a little.
Pronouns = \ = gender. A lot of non binary people go by she/her or he/him, and a lot of cis people go by they/them. Many of us have changed our pronouns multiple times in our lives, it’s just that none of us are very famous (I think).
Can we all take a moment to appreciate the pun, that if Demi Lovato uses she/they pronouns Demi is a Demigirl. <3

It's obviously up to Demi to identify as such, but this is an option as a gender identity for she/they pronouns.

She's still nonbinary. Nonbinary people don't just use they/them pronouns. Some use he/they (like me). Some use she/they (like Demi Levato). Some use all and some use none. Nonbinary isn't a third box.
I think the headlines are sometimes misleading, I believe Demi Lovato is using She/They now. It's okay to get it wrong and have to try another option, I know a couple of my friends were well into their transitions before the realized they were non-binary rather than trans or the other way around. I'm glad she's acknowledged it publicly, because I think people need to see that it's okay to question and figure themselves out over time. I'm not upset, I'm happy that someone in the public eye is going through this so that it raises awareness.
perhaps put less stock into what celebrities do with their time and genders.
I'm assuming she's just exploring her gender identity. Nothing to be angered about.
Many of us try different pronouns until we find ones that fit best, and for some of us it can be a long journey 
Ms Lovato has my full support
I'm a she/they nonbinary demiwoman who typically puts my ""she/her"" pronouns first. It's very possible that she could still be nonbinary to an extent but is preferring to present as feminine.

But if she's not, then at least she tried something to see if it felt right. Lots of people don't get their identity pinned down on the first try.

I'm not even sure I've got the right terminology for my own gender ID or sexuality. I just kind of keep going with whatever feels right.

Identity is a weird thing.
I think most people have it covered here, but I get why the immediate reaction was maybe frustration(?) Demi is one of the most well known enbies and it's frustrating that this is something transphobes are going to run with saying that being nonbinary isn't real, or is a phase.

Also fuck all the headline writers who made it sound like she completely changed her pronouns back instead of adding she back into the mix along with they
I think because she's a celebrity all of a sudden it's a bad thing to be queer. I'm not trying to bash you or anything but would you question this is she wasn't a celebrity? Probably not. That's what I don't get, she's human just like anyone else. Why do we automatically assume someone has ill intentions just because they are popular?
I really don't see how her changing back is offensive. but I struggle to understand a lot of the view points on this sub so idk. people here seem very divorced from my non binary experience.

I'd just let yourself feel how you want to feel and not be so concerned with the overall narrative of the non-binary community because we simply don't agree on anything regarding these ideas anyway
Wouldn't she be considered genderfluid then? There's nothing wrong with that
Demi's identity is her business same as all of us. This doesn't feel disrespectful at all.
People can go by she/her only and be nonbinary. I know agender people who are like ""oh you know what, I do not have a gender just good vibes only"" (somewhere I was at for awhile as well) They still just used the pronouns everyone defaults too for them, they just don't particularly care. I know for me when I was still using agender I used all pronouns just because I didn't particularly care. But if someone asked, I defaulted to she/her.
People are allowed to try things. If no one ever questioned their gender, these subs would be empty and we'd all still be miserable believing there were no other options. I think everyone should take a good hard look at their gender and make sure they're not just doing what they're ""supposed to do."" And if they look at it and go, ""yep, I'm cis"" at least they had Thoughts.

Now I don't know anything about Demi Lovato, the name is familiar but I couldn't pick her out of a line up or tell you what she's a celebrity for. Even if I could, I don't know her motivation or read her mind (and neither can anyone else) so I'm gonna assume she was genuinely questioning. This ""just a fad"" rhetoric is going to hurt everyone in the long run
Pronouns have little to do with your identity as a whole.
Demi Lovato is still nonbinary, they just use she/her in addition to they/them.
They’re still non-binary! She’s using both they/them and she/her pronouns. Completely valid and I’m very happy they are becoming more and more themself.
People with this attitude who act like exploring your gender and deciding that it’s not for them lead to the harsh gatekeeping that gets in the way of transition for many
God, a lot of people in this comment section suck. People are allowed to question their gender identity as many times as they feel fit until they find what feels right for them. As somebody else said in this comment section, if we weren't allowed to question our gender identity than a lot of these subs wouldn't exist. A lot of these comments have the same energy as some cis person saying somebody isn't supposed to question their assigned gender at birth. 

And yes, you are being disrespectful for questioning why she flipped back.
I believe they still have they/them pronouns listed as well. It’s not our place to judge other people’s journeys in this realm. I get so tired of gatekeepers being like “You’re valid!!!! Unless you’re a celebrity I dislike in which case you’re probably faking”
I have gone back and forth and now I do they/them and he/him, gender identity is fluid, I would just say maybe worry about yourself and don't put so much stock into what other people do but respect her pronouns or I'll come at you because I'm Batman.
Forgive me, I haven’t read all the comments, but Demi still uses she/her/they/them pronouns, so technically, Demi is still non-binary. 

I don’t like how some media sites used her/them as clickbait. Let’s be real here, so many people don’t read past the title, so I think it was more disrespectful of the media sites to do that to Demi AND I think the media sites used her/them as a scapegoat to stir up controversy about the non-binary community.
You’re telling me you never experimented with different pronouns?
So many people have pointed out that you are wrong, and yet you ignore those comments. Do you just think she/they pronouns are not valid or something?
I honestly think most people probably never used they/them for Demi, and it probably just was a kinda awful feeling— might just be projecting though lol
I read the article for context, and she said she originally adopted they/them pronouns bc they felt like a human-as in not male or female, just a human. Now they added she/her pronouns back bc they’re feeling more feminine these days and she described herself as feeling fluid gender-wise. I honestly think the headlines were really poorly worded-I get your confusion. 

In case anyone is confused by my pronoun use-I alternated using both sets of pronouns for Demi Lovato-hope it reads alright.
They’ve been going by She/They pronouns as far as I’ve heard. Still non-binary but for many people using both is easier/more comfortable. She also may be continuing to explore her gender and being in Althea spotlight I wouldn’t be surprised if she got a ton of backlash for their coming out story which I imagine would make things harder.
Genderfluidity or the fact that anyone can be however far they're into identifying the way they are and yet still question it
[they say they are a fluid person in their life and her gender](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/demi-lovato-pronouns-she-her_n_62e98bede4b0c5501614cfe3?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=news_tab&fs=e&s=cl)
They might be gender fluid, which still somewhat fits under the umbrella of being non-binary. I've heard from a few people that Demi changed their pronouns to they/she, which lots of people in the community go by. It's a valid question though, and thank you for asking!
[deleted]
Not disrespectful in the slightest. Essentially saying that identifying as enby allowed them to find their humanity again, giving them the mental space to find her femininity again. I don't know the person, but it sounds like the whole story might be a bit different than it first seems from headlines as well...
Nothing wrong with her doing this. Well, that would be the case if she didn't say the following.  I have a friend who thought they where Non-Binary, but turns out he was just a trans man. Thinking your non-binary and changing your mind is all fine and stuff, it's your journey afterall. But her saying what she did made it seem offensive to Non Binary People, whether it was truly meant that way is a mystery. (Edit: idk if this is important to say, but idk who Demi even is)
There’s nothing wrong with her going back or further exploring her identity. However there’s also nothing wrong with being upset about feeling as if you’ve lost representation. Both can coexist.
Your edit is everything. Thank you for prompting great discussion and truly hearing what people had to say.
The media is just tearing Demi down and spreading misinformation about the interview that happened today. It's so gross.
Sounds like she's just trying to use pronouns as a trend
There are 3 possibilities here.

1. She realized she was wrong/ she was just exprimentinf

2. She just prefers she/her to they/them

3. She was pretending to be non-binary to sell more stuff (I don’t think this is likely, but you never know. She has been fading from the spotlight for a while)

Edit: i didn’t account for the possibility of Demi being a she/they. Kinda weird considered I’m a he/they
Well, the human part I felt triggered, but sometimes you can question, and then find out you actually are a straight cis. Also, sometimes people might identify as a gender, and they really are that, but as time goes by, they can return to their original self
[deleted]
tbf, demi lovato does seem to he a bit of a nut, but that doesn't make their identity any less valid. even the ultrarich have a complicated relationship with gender, but because their platform is so much more public its held to much more scrutiny. doesnt mean your offense is misplaced, but celebrities are at the end of the day peiple too
I made a post about my concerns to her gender identity not long ago.. this only confirms it all.

Being non-binary is not a lifestyle.. nor is it the answers to all your problems. It's just a gender identity...
My pronouns are king and lord
Did she actually say she just wants to ""feel human""? Umm that feels pretty invalidating to be fair. Does she believe nonbinary folk are not human?
idk, i think it's pretty normal for your identity to change, it's okay to try out different labels and pronouns. it does feel kinda weird that she said she wants to feel human though... but maybe it's related to the backlash she was getting after the coming out, and referring to the fact people were disrespecting her because of it
Instagram still has both she and they
""Seasons still change, but you'll still be the same."" -Yours Truly
[removed]
Going by they/she instead of they/them doesn't make you not nonbinary. It is totally valid to use any pronouns and still be nonbinary.
Yep, I use she/they and tbh I'm not really offended when people slip and call me he or use ""sir."" I've had people mistakenly call me ""your honor"" and really? I think that's how all enbies should be addressed going forward.
Adding to that, there are also people who go by she/they/him. Jonathan Van Ness for example.
Please upvote this to the top ugh. People need to read the articles not just the title of Reddit posts by someone that just straight up lied.
Exactly I use they/them/she/her and am *STILL* non-binary, I’m just fluid between feminine and neutral aligned genders
[deleted]
I have an NB child. If they are going through a “phase” (aka:questioning) which is what most family/friends are quick to ask:

Who tf cares? They can be any gender they want at any time they want. 

At least I was a fucking supportive parent. Damn.

The word “phase” infuriated me. So what? Why are we so worried about what our children are doing with the private parts we’ve spent their entire lives telling them are their OWN private parts anyway? 

Those parts, feelings, identity, gender norms…

Those are NOT *** my business regardless of how many times you change it or how many “phases” you go through regardless of if you’re my child, friend, or a celebrity…

Just be supportive. It’s not hard. It’s not about anyone but the person you’re supporting. 

I wish people would get this. It seriously makes my blood boil.

Edit: NOT *** my business.
It's totally fine, the problem is that radicals are going to equate this to the ""It's just a fad/the popular thing to do"" rhetoric, even if it was just trying on something that didn't fit in the end
they still use they/them, but also she/her. she’s still non-binary, the actual article wasn’t saying they changed their pronouns, but that she added to them.
This, Demi just happens to be a celebrity so every move she makes is extremely publicized. She should still be allowed to explore her identity
I saw an article where Demi Lovato literally said something about feeling ""fluid"" when it comes to their gender. I think maybe she could possibly be genderfluid and is still figuring out what labels, terms, and expressions feel comfortable.
and this change happened quite a while ago, unless I'm missing something.
Maybe OP just read a news article that unfairly uses this to promote a transphobic agenda. 

I think that’s the real invalidating possibility of this, not Demi Lovato, good for her, she has done no wrong. 

But what might be a problem and invalidating is articles and media using this to say “see it’s just a trend,” or “she regretted it, so will everyone else when they wake up.” I think that’s the real negative invalidating fallout that might happen from this.
[deleted]
Friend, I don't even like Demi Lovato 😂 

I was, however, very excited when she came out as nonbinary last year, simply because she's a popular and outspoken artist. What a chance for some NB representation! Like yasss please we need more NB people in those positions! Even if she is next gen Lindsay Lohan, it's still something. 

I'm just sad that I'm losing that chance.
she's a singer btw, she's been around for quite sometime, since like 2007
You stop spreading opinion based information. Genderfluid is under the non-binary umbrella. Also she didn’t go back to she/her only, they use she/they pronouns.
GENDERFLUID IS UNDER THE NON-BINARY UMBRELLA. THEY ARE NON-BINARY
https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/welwz3/about_demi_lovato/iipjycp?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
absolutely agree
[Demi still uses they/them alongside she/her](https://www.instagram.com/ddlovato/?hl=en), [they're *still* nonbinary.](https://spoutpodcast.sounder.fm/episode/demi-lovato)
AND it kind of makes the NBs look bad. If Demi Lovato 'went through a phase' and detransitioned, imagine how many people will start questioning the validity of other NBs.
Wow that post aged well in only 2 weeks. You are very right, all her interviews about being NB were like ""I threw off the shackles of gender because I want to do what I want, oh and also religious trauma made me ashamed to be a woman""
""I didn't feel necessarily like a woman, I didn't feel like a man. Um, I just felt like a human and that's what they/them is about. For me, it's just about like feeling human at your core.""
Demi Lovato absolutely believes nonbinary people are human, the OP was taking the quote out of context.
WAKE UP SHEEPLE
Your honor?  That's glorious and I'm insisting on those pronouns from now on.
My nonbinary friend and I (I'm genderqueer) always refer to eachother as ""m'lord"" and it's honestly my fave
Omg exact same for me. Although I've never been called ""your honor""! Lmao
How about “your excellency”?
Are you a judge or something?
I prefer ""your highness"" but will settle for anything (except ""it"") really so long as the person is polite.
That'll be me too
Yeah I saw that Reddit post and commented basically this same thing on it too. Because when you click the article it clearly says “added pronouns” not “changed back to”.
Also, my pronouns are she/they as well, although I prefer they. We exist!
Everything I’ve read literally says they/them and decided she/her is also acceptable because they’ve been feeling more feminine lately. But ok.
insta says they/them and she/her

okay, but you should have a problem with them, not her. You going to point fingers at every person who experiments bc the “radicals” may use it against us?
Yeah they changed it a while back. They just talked about It in an interview for the first time today
If only we had something - like a globe wide mesh - that we could access for free in order to fact check one article against the reality. God, that would be so nice.

Also, *Demi is still nonbinary* so 1. there's no ""phase"" and 2. why are you blaming minorities for our oppressors actions?
Transphobes don't fucking care what we do, how many boots we lick, how much we conform to their view of what we should be; **they still hate us**. So why the *fuck* should we have to cater to them? Who *cares* if Demi defining themselves a little more gives them a little ammo for a week? *They've been shooting at us the entire time anyway.*
Hi, there! :) Not sure what part you're confused about in my statement.

I don't see me defining how pronouns work, for there to be an issue. What I did mention was a possible gender identity that exists, is valid, and an option for those who use she/they pronouns.

Hope that helps! <3
not exactly, there's always a possibility that she might actually be non-binary. it doesn't even matter though, it's her gender and it's not right to get upset over it
You don’t have to use only they/them pronouns to be non-binary… so her adding she/her back to her pronouns isn’t losing representation.
Trans umbrella***
oh ok. I didn’t even know who Demi was before today so idk their situation or anything like that.
Oh, I was completely wrong. Thanks for the info

Yup. This. It's ""your honor"" or GTFO
If anybody ever tips a fedora at me and says ""m'they'dy"" I will leave my physical form and ascend to nirvana!

What do they use with the Pope? I want that one!
I'm a lawyer, so people will come up to me in court to ask a question or something, and I guess they figure since you call a judge ""your honor"" that this is what they're supposed to call everyone to be polite?

There’s always room for more NB kids (and everyone else, too) in my heart. If you need a “mom” my inbox is open. 

Thank you for your kind words ❤️
… but I’m literally doing the opposite? 

Do you understand what grooming is?

I’m so sick of that word being used out of context. It creates issues for children who need parents and law enforcement to take the word seriously and it’s now so over-used, it can’t be.

JFC get ahold of yourself.
Let me add that these are not *my* viewpoints, but what I believe some people are equating the situation to
yoo happy cake day !!
I’m sorry if I didn’t communicate my intentions properly, but all I meant to say is, your original comment was that “OP why would get off on lying about trans people?” 

And all I meant to say was that, depending on where OP got the information, it might be better to place the responsibility on biased transphobic media, and not directly place it on OP, who could’ve easily read an article about how “Demi realizes she’s a woman after all!”

I said in my post that Demi has done no wrong, good for her. So I don’t see why you think I’m saying we as a minority should be responsible for what transphobes do. I don’t see why you say that I’m saying that Demi adding to her identity is a problem? Where do I blame minorities for our oppressors actions? 

All I said was that OP might’ve gotten this information from biased articles, not everyone fact checks every single thing they read. And the responsibility of the “lie” you point out in your comment could easily be transphobic media, and that that’s the most invalidating aspect here that this can be unfairly taken advantage of. I was careful to say that Demi has done no wrong, good for her, it’s not her fault if transphobes misinterpret her words either deliberately or deliberately. 

So sorry, I don’t really see why you see the reason to call me out for “blaming minorities for our oppressors actions?” I was just trying to say in response to you that OP might not be directly lying depending on where they heard this…..

So please, I don’t know why you decided to send such a demoralizing comment, in a place where we are supporting eachother against oppressors, but I would appreciate if you would realize that I’m not blaming minorities and that perhaps OP was asking an honest question and not lying

Am I really saying anything wrong by saying the only problem here is transphobes?
[deleted]
Obviously. But their argument was specifically that Demi isn't non-binary
No problem; OP has written this post in absolute bad faith.
[removed]
she may not have realized that she was just experimenting. it may have felt very real and permanent to her at the time.
🎩 m’they’dy!
“Your Holiness” I think
Genderfluid is under the umbrella of non-binary genders..
genderfluid falls under the nonbinary umbrella tho
This would be like saying non-binary ppl aren't trans, enby is under the umbrella, and gf is under enby
>Same umbrella category of queer, still not the same thing.

.....do you even know the definition of non-binary? non-binary is when your gender identity is ""neither fully male or fully female"". genderfluid, due to the fact that the person's gender fluctuates (and not even always just between the binary genders), is by definition a non-binary identity
if you read past the headlines it literally says Demi uses both they and she pronouns and that this is common among non-binary people. we’re allowed to evolve.
Didn’t know you were such an expert on how other people feel about themselves. Also way to throw genderfluid nonbinary people under the bus lmao
>She is fluid. Not non binary

genderfluidity *is* non-binary. quit gatekeeping
and who appointed you here to speak for those people? and if you don’t agree, why are you speaking on some other people’s opinion’s behalf?

Edit, for clarity: Not trying to be rude. I just don’t understand the use in replying to seemingly defend or explain a viewpoint that you don’t even agree with.
>**Comment One:** But what might be a problem and invalidating is articles and media using this to say “see it’s just a trend,” or “she regretted it, so will everyone else when they wake up.” I think that’s the real negative invalidating fallout that might happen from this.  
>  
>**Comment Two:** I don’t really see why you see the reason to call me out for “blaming minorities for our oppressors actions?

You're literally saying that Demi exploring their gender is a reason media will accuse us of faking. 

Newsflash: ***Society has been transphobic long before any celebrity ever explored their gender in the public eye.***
Right. As I said. So if I'm technically right, as you say, then there really isn't any need for mockery of how I type ""hope that helps <3"" nor is there a need for a debate here. 

At this point you're just entering troll territory, which I'm not investing any further of my time into.
Well she's not. She's gender-fluid. Which is under the trans umbrella.
I've reported them to mods. Seems like they're intentionally invalidating she/they people at this point
Of all places to see people being gatekeeping, I never thought it would be here.
""Your Holiness"" makes me feel like a top-tier pornstar with the best holes in 4k.

I'll take it.

True, but we need to understand what we are up against on the road to acceptance. Memes are posted all the time showing those same points from unaccepting people. What they say angers us, becomes very tiring and I’m sick of the disparaging, but public commentary is relevant to celebrity news. Demi is going through something controversial and on balance it’s beneficial that celebrities are treading this path for us in front of the world.
I’m not saying that’s Demi’s fault or her responsibility. But that the transphobic media is a problem. I’m not saying Demi shouldn’t have given an interview adding she/her pro nouns, I only meant to say that OP might’ve been mislead by transphobic media unfortuently taking advantage of this. 

I was just trying to give OP the benefit of the doubt, to say that maybe it’s a bit of a rush to say they’re getting off on lying about trans people. Of course society and patriarchy has always been transphobic, and that’s not the fault of us trans people that speak out about our experience. 

Why is it so bad to say that a beautiful thing like Demi talking about adding she/her pronouns in an interview might be unfairly used by the media and patriarchy? I said that to give OP the benefit of the doubt, I don’t want to discourage people from asking questions about things they may not know here by saying they’re getting off on lying about trans people.

ETA, Beautiful things that trans people do are often unfairly used by the media and patriarchy, you say that’s always been the case so what’s the point in mentioning it, but if it’s true what’s so bad about mentioning that it exists? Isn’t it okay that some of us mention it, without blaming Demi or putting any blame on her?
Genderfluid is under the non-binary umbrella, *which is under the trans umbrella*. They're *all three*
You’re just being a gatekeeper. Gatekeepers, in the queer community nonetheless, are shitty. If you don’t feel like you’re strictly a man or strictly a woman, you’re probably non-binary. That’s literally it. That’s the one qualification.
I’m pretty sure we all get what we are up against without someone replying to a reddit comment about why we can’t get mad at the celeb. 

It was just irrelevant to the point I was making, and it’s not what OP was asking either.
You can give whoever you want benefit of the doubt. I'm quite happy with knowing fact checking is free and easy, and calling people like OP who are too lazy to do so out on just that. You can check their comment history to know just how [absolutely](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/welwz3/comment/iip2ysi/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [disgustin](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/welwz3/comment/iip22i7/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)g they've been about Demi and [how little benefit they actually deserve](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/welwz3/comment/iiozque/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

... It's almost like fact checking can save a whole lot of issues here, or something.
Oh shit okay

I'm non binary and I didn't know that fluidity was under non binary, thought all 3 were subtypes of trans identity tbh. Thats 100% where I'm coming from and why I deleted my comments when I realized they were wrong
So as not to offend other nbs I will leave it there.
Yeah I didn’t see all that, but that doesn’t make my original reply to you wrong or bad? 

If this is just about that every single person posting here should fact check their post before asking a honest question then okay, we just have a difference of opinion about asking an honest question on a sub for non binary people.
Oh, glad to help then! 😁
ain't an honest question if you're spreading misinformation.

im done here. you either get it or continue to be willfully obtuse, but im out.

Your pronouns don't dictate how non-binary you are. You can be non-binary and exclusively use the pronouns associated with your AGAB. You can present masc and use she/her. You don't have to use they/them at all if you don't like it. Pronouns are part of gender expression, not gender itself.
I've always felt like I wasn't nonbinary enough since I came out because I didn't fit what I guess would be a fetishized ( for lack of a better term) appearances of what ""nonbinary"" would be.

I really appreciate posts like this.
Thank you! Needed this:)
Yup!
I'm just recently discovering myself and I really neded this. This is one my biggest fears. I've spent too much of my life being told my appearance defines me.

 Thank you
Thank you ♥️
Thank you! I needed this.
Thank you, I really needed this tonight
Thank you. I needed to hear that.
Thank you 💜
Recently out person here, I was in denial for along time due to people around me being awful as a child but now im accepting myself and i’ve honestly never felt better
Thank you, I really needed this. It's been a couple months since discovering my identity and it's been rough with all the thoughts inside my head.
Thank you, I needed this.
Thanks, I really needed to hear this rn 💜 I've known that I'm girlflux for about half a year now and there have been so many times when I've thought ""oh, maybe i'm doing all of this for attention"", even though I've realised that being called a girl all the time (or being associated solely with feminine traits) has always irked me in a way, I just wasn't able to put my finger on it.
We all need this reminder sometimes, Thankyou 💕
I really needed this, thank you so much
Lege absolute lege
Cool to see parents who are so supportive
Lol yeah I think a lot of trans people do that
Haha, don't worry I cut my hair short

My brain still likes to tell me I'm doing it for attention 🙃
Yes please have low voices and be femme presenting, please! I'm AFAB & femme presenting and have a really deep voice, so I've always been self-conscious about it. I'm at the point where my ""professional voice"" with clients is about 2 octaves higher than my normal voice. But then I learned the secret words that changed my life: fuck gender norms. Just fuck the gender binary, period.

Don't let anyone relate the pitch of your voice to your AGAB. I would love it if some of my transfemme and femme presenting peeps would help me normalize Femmes of the Contralto Tones!
Well said sib well said
I should've also said that it doesn't matter if you're dysphoric towards your birth gender or not
You're welcome
👍
You're appearance doesn't define you only you can do that
You're welcome
You're welcome you gender norms bending magnificent being
You're welcome
You're welcome
You're welcome we all occasionally need a little ray of sunshine through the window to make us feel cared for i feel helping others makes me feel better
Yeah when I cracked I felt better than I ever have but now I'm just spiralling
You're welcome
*offers hug*
My brain does the same :(
This thought process right here, that's what everyone needs
I dress as a femme pirate and have a decently low voice, by the look on some people's faces they are pretty surprised when I start speaking, adverting their expectations does bring me some joy 😊
Ahhh you've spoken to my heart...deep voiced AFAB here. I used to go home and cry or get really anxious at the end of the day when I worked at a box office, and at the time couldn't figure out why. Turns out, I'm non-binary, and talking up the octave all day was really dysphoric for me 🙃

Now I'm finally starting to embrace my lower voice and actually emphasizing it. Never felt better!
Haha same...
That's amazing! I'm still trying to get over my own hangups but it's hard. Subvert their expectations and keep being awesome! 😊
Hello, fellow AFAB Alto!!! 😊 That's what I'm trying to do too: brace the voice! My throat often hurts after working all day talking to all of our clients in a higher pitch. My favorite are the hard of hearing clients who do better with my deeper voice, so I lean into it and really enjoy speaking as myself. I'll agree that mine also gives me some slight dysphoria (nowhere near as bad as the excess hair growth cause by my PCOS and high testosterone, but not great either).

Glad you get to enjoy your voice now! I'm working on it myself but getting there!"	rfowwn	NonBinary	485	1.0	2021-12-13 20:14:20
I rly need to stop dating cis men & find a nice gf or nb partner who won’t invalidate my identity ;-;		"Saaame. Its so hard finding fellow nbs to date though, especially me being in TN. Riiiight in the middle of the Bible Belt. Sighs.
I lucked into marrying a bi dude (cis), who is omnivorously into however I decide to present on a given day. Gotta love the bi folks! 

Edit: I forgot to mention that your hair Is amazing!
oh my God, I love your hair!
As someone born male, I am constantly embarrassed by others of my AGAB. Some of these mofos better learn to behave bruh
Amazing hair!!
invalidation really is a pain in the ass, but just know that this random enby is here to support you! :)
Love the hair!
Just started dating a femme person, highly recommend
I feel that. I'm the only enby in a very Catholic school, pre everything and always being dead named all the time. It's hard, but I know you will find someone who validates you, and loves you for who you are❤️
Genuinely chose to stop actively looking to date CIStr8 men and it's been the best decision of my life
I get your frustration, but there are Cis men who are kind and will love who you are. My husband is cis and is the best partner for me. Let's not hate on an entire gender identity... that's why we all get so much hate in the first place.
I’d love a poly relationship. Spread the love.
I love your hair!
Actual Bi Nb born as males are heaven sent I promise
Im the 420th upvote.   Recent Enby. Dating a long time enby:)
Dude, yes.

I hit it lucky with my partner (cis man) being so accepting and actively trying to adjust his language when talking about me. Lots of deep conversations on the subject as well. We've been together for a little over 4 years and I've only been out as NB for like, 5 months? His reaction was basically ""Well I kinda knew that."" when I told him, tears streaming down my face.  🤦‍♀️


Anyway, I agree. 
You need to be with someone who sees you and accepts ALL of you. Respects your pronouns, doesn't care about ""what you really are"" (gag, ugh), but just sees you, an attractive blue-haired human, and all the qualities that make you lovable. Whether that be a girl, another enby, or even a needle-in-a-haystack cis man.

You need to find a partner you DESERVE.
Wow hi am I swooning rn? 😍love your vibe
I'm sorry it's so tough, but enby's are slowing changing the world - gender shouldn't matter - love a person for who they are!
I feel that. I'm from Georgia surrounded by cis men who always say ""but You lOok lIKe A gIRL.""
but Galatians 3,28?

\[...\] theres neither male nor female \[...\]

shouldn't be all christians enby?
I’m glad u found a nice and accepting man but being wary of men because of lived experience isn’t the reason NB people get hate.
Southern Louisiana here. 

And SAME. 

Sure, my body might suggest ""girl,"" but my fuckin' MOUTH is telling you otherwise, prick.
Best of luck to you."	mu75fd	NonBinary	469	0.99	2021-04-19 18:31:09
I only realized I am nonbinary about ~7 months ago. My husband supports but doesn't understand & that hurts my heart. We had a disagreement involving how important my general identity is...Idk I am looking for validation that I can be a femme presenting self-identified wife and still be nonbinary 😅		"You can do whatever You want.

That sounds really hard, I hope it was initial shock, but I believe in you
You can be whoever you want, and use whatever labels you want! As a self-identified nonbinary boy, lemme tell you labels get weird. Hopefully he will learn, even if he can't really understand. Best of luck being a badass nonbinary wife ❤
It is really difficult, that you have this identity that most people don’t understand, I come from the other hand of the spectrum and my wife understands but is a bit afraid of what it will mean. I guess trying our best to communicate our feelings and wishes is the only thing we can do really :)
Gender identity =/= expression and gender identity =/= actions. You can be dress hyper feminine, enjoy the classical family roles, be the most stereotypical mother of all moms and still be non-binary.

I am an enby myself and I use some of the archetypes of the binary gender to express or explain myself, simply because those bits and pieces align with me (at that moment in time) and I enjoy using them. Some pieces happen to align with my assigned gender at birth and/or what I perceive to be societies expectations, some don't. 

But most importantly: only you can say who you are and nobody else. So if you say you are non-binary, you are: you don't owe the world more explaining than ""that's just what I am"".
You are absolutely valid! How you choose to physically present has nothing to do with how you identify. Society has taught us all that this isn't the case, which can take time to unlearn (for both ourselves and our significant others). 

While I haven't read it, I've been recommended the book ""Love lives here"" which is written by the cis partner of a trans woman. Maybe not completely relevant to your situation, but looking for ways your partner can learn more/adjust sounds like it may help them gain additional perspectives to aid in understanding.
As a non-binary trans guy, I got you. I’ll be taking the title of husband like a binary guy but I also like partner or significant other. It’s sometimes hard to explain but the best way I can say is that you’re femme non-binary or something similar but it’s up to you
You are valid! There are femme nonbinary people everywhere, you don’t have to look or present a certain way to identify with any gender. I hope your husband understands soon, and I believe in you :)
I feel your frustration and pain! I started figuring my enby identity out while in a serious relationship with a cis man. We split up (different reasons) before I could get to the point that I could accept myself without that missing understanding and validation. To be honest, I don't know if he could have ever gotten to the point that he truly fully understood. It is a very nuanced and personal experience and hard to explain to cis people sometimes. I still wish he had put in more effort.

Some thoughts looking back on my own struggles:

As a couple you might be used to deal with things together, but this might be something you have to figure out on your own. Not that you can't include him, but doing so in every step of the way might hold you back to a point where it strains your relationship.  The insecurity in the shaping of a new identity makes communicating your wants and needs even harder. If you work on it on your own, you might find that it would be easier then to ask for the support you want and need. And find other people to talk to. Because that is still an important reflection process. 

I hope you find a way to create the space to figure yourself out. It takes time and a lot of work. Doing it despite the missing understanding and validation can be especially hard and complicated. Gender roles in relationships are especially hard to dissect and reassess if you have been together for long. And that might make it even more difficult to find your true self underneath it all.

And of course you can identify as a wife and nonbinary! In my mind there's no contradiction there. Claim it as your reality, don't let other people tell you what you are. 

All the love and a lot of strength❤️
Thank you everyone for your kind words 😭🥰 I posted this last night on a whim and never thought I would be met with so much love and support. You have all given such great advice, thank you so much!! 🥰🥰
Hi, a self-identified amab husband with male pronouns who’s an enby. You’re not alone 🙂
I'm new here, and new to thinking of myself as nonbinary (only a month!), but I feel like I understand how you feel. I'm not married, but my boyfriend has always been supportive of me. I go back and forth on the term ""wife"" (like, is there a good reason NOT to like the word ""wife""? Does it affirm what I feel about myself?) But have settled on the feeling that it is a title to hold. There's absolutely nothing wrong about seeking validation that you can be a femme presenting self-identified wife and still be nonbinary, and you can let yourself live free believing it. This love/acceptance of your self can bring you strength,confidence, safety, balance-- you're married, you're a wife, you're nonbinary, and you have the rest of time to wait for your husband to see you fully bloomed.❤
I have been there! He just needs time to understand what being non binary is like for you and what it means to you (I’m guessing you told him). Not everybody will get it immediately, even if they are the love of your live and perfect for you. We wish that it was the case and in an ideal universe it would be, but we are definitely not living in one so instant acceptance and understanding is sadly still something very rare. But most importantly. Never let that influence how you see yourself! You are valid and nothing and no one should change that!
Oh, hon, you are going to be just fine! You can be a wife and not be a woman. Maybe you're a demigirl, or you're just agender without dysphoria, or any number of things. Sometimes a person's just got to ditch the idea of gender and be themselves... which can include being your  husband's wife, can include having long hair and wearing dresses.

Tell your husband that you are still the person he loves, that you will always love him, and that your exploring gender is not going to change any of that.
#you're valid ♥️
Of course you can!! If that’s who you are, that’s who you are!! ❤️
I'm sorry that you're feeling misunderstood. Based on what you wrote, it does sound like he wants to be supportive, and it could be that he just needs time. A wise saying for all LGBTQ coming out matters is this - you've had your whole life to come to this understanding. It's sometimes necessary to give your loved ones a little while to understand it too. 

You deserve respect and understanding, and if your husband refuses to understand you that's one thing. But it might be a matter of time and patience. I wish you both the best of luck, and I'll be thinking about you.
Mt partner of almost 5 years didn't react very well either. He even said that he may not have chosen to start dating me if i had already came out as non-binary and he wasn't sure he was attracted to non-binary people.

He's gotten a lot better since and he uses my pronouns pretty often. I think he just didn't understand. I think a lot of people don't understand. I've been this way my whole life, I just didn't have a word or pronoun before that I could use to describe it🤷🏼‍♂️
You’re kinda describing me! Been figuring out my gender identity over the last year or so, and still stick with “wife” and “mom” (in relation to my cat lol), but have asked my husband to respect my pronoun choice of “they.” He slips up sometimes, but he’s known me as “she” for years, so I don’t blame him for slipping up.

As for your husband, maybe try writing all your thoughts down if you haven’t already, and then bring that to a discussion. I find it can be easier to keep your thoughts together in difficult conversations, but having them already thought out helps.

You’re valid 100%, no matter your gender, no matter your presentation.
Take it from me you are a completely valid individual , my situation is kinda similar I’m a nonbinary demigirl and self-identified wife and I use she/they pronouns. I hope all the best for you and your relationship stay strong ☺️
I am a masc-presenting self-identified husband and am also nonbinary (masc agender), so I am your male equivalent. My wife is very supportive. We have been together for 26 years. I have been open with her about my identity since I started to become aware of it over 20 years ago. Give him time. Your cat seems to approve.
 [https://magic-gps.tumblr.com/post/618062909732438016](https://magic-gps.tumblr.com/post/618062909732438016) (it's a slightly nerdy art/gender piece about pronouns and gender)

also, I think ash hardell has a video on being called wife and being non-binary
Is there a certain part he doesn’t understand?
You know what I call myself? A nonbinary woman. Doesn't sound like it makes sense, right? If you're a woman, you're female.

But the thing is, it takes more than gender identity to become a woman. You need to grow up, and while growing up you go through some stuff that men, or masc presenting people, don't experience in the same way. You learn to stand up for yourself, and to fight for yourself, you learn how to respectfully tell your chemistry teacher to stop being a sexist dick when he tells you, the best person in the course, that it's nice to see you having fun, but to not try so hard, because you won't need that knowledge when you ""settle down and have children"".

My experiences made me a woman. I can get behind everything this word means for me, except for the fact that it's associated with a female gender identity.

So I'm a nonbinary woman. 

And you can be whatever the fuck you want to be, because that's the beauty of nonbinary identities. We don't have to fit into a premade slot in society. We choose our own ways. 

If you like being called a wife, then you are a wife. Simple as that.

I'm sure your husband will understand eventually.
You're more valid than the cake I'm currently eating, but the cake is pretty valid, so that makes you even more valid
Nonbinary is nonbinary, whether you present the gender you were assigned at birth to the max, flip to the ""other"" side, or hang out somewhere in the middle. 

I hope your husband comes around. I'm sure it's just new for him.
Be yourself, you are valid.
Idk, you look nb to me.

But really, it’s okay though. gender and the expression of, can be confusing. You’re valid and hoping your husband will continue to grow with you.
You are valid. Also you are so gorgeous
Take it from me you are a completely valid individual , my situation is kinda similar I’m a nonbinary demigirl and self-identified wife and I use she/they pronouns. I hope all the best for you and your relationship stay strong ☺️
Try explaining that to my therapist. Oof. Some of them are so much worse then family... 😬 (It's the South though so I'm pretty sure it's more a case of wtf is non-binary than any sort of hostility since she's generally not an asshole?) (Though as a therapist technically it falls on her to, ya know, look it up, but it's a charity/Medicaid clinic so you know that ain't happening.)

Edited. I think and comment more. Sorry.
I have found few people who put my feelings into words as well as you have but when I do I may have to steal their verbiage. So you take it as a compliment comrade.
I hope it gets better. It definitely took my cis husband at least a week to sort of wrap his head around it. He didn't really understand what it meant but for me my gender expression won't change at all, just how I identify. I had to reassure him that I wasn't a different person, that I've always been this person. And it took a few weeks but I think he's finally starting to see that now.
I am blessed living in a country where mental health is properly organised - I can't even imagine how shitty it must be in the US. 😔

And I tend to agree that a lot of awkwardness or perceived aggression comes from a lack of understanding and conflicts between their existing world views and us existing.

For binary folks, acknowledging that there is more outside of the binary also means acknowledging the subjectivity and relativity of gender. That can be pretty overwhelming, especially for people who previously used the ""sex = gender"" argument as a way to explain/""defend"" their identity. So if anyone freak out or acts weird, I always remind myself that they are human as well and I try to emphatize with their perspective (to a certain degree ofcourse).

Therapists are humans to, and perhaps you are the first enby she actually encounters so I think you should give her time to learn what it means to you. But you are right: your therapist should support you in your identity.

With that being said: when it comes to specifically gender identity, I think there is more value with talking through thoughts and feelings with peers, and let the therapist help you manage that process, rather than asking her identity questions.

Ps: I have no idea why you should say sorry to me, but if its because of something you edited away than don't worry about it. I haven't read it and i don't care what it was. I see nothing wrong with your response so we're cool 😊
That is the biggest compliment you can give to me, so by all means: take my words and make them your own. And fyi that's not stealing in my book, the free in free speech is there for a reason :) It's not like my words aren't rooted in the words of others :)
I am actually awaiting my first appointment with a psych next week to get on the road to help get my expression in line with my identity (darn gates in my area) but this will help me put it into words with them.
Awesome! Good for you on taking those steps! Self care and mental wellbeing are extremely important and I'm glad you don't let stigma and prejudice get in the way of either. Good luck and I'm sure you got this!"	gje19y	NonBinary	464	0.99	2020-05-14 03:03:36
I want to get my hair cut, badly. My hair has long been a source of discomfort because I never feel like it really represents me in my identity. I cut a bunch off a few months ago and now I hate it more. Any suggestions for a hair cut/style that may help bring me away from fem w/o being too masc?		"Pixie cuts are nice for soft but short. Undercuts are fun for a blend of edge and soft but it’s a commitment because growing out the shaved half is not fun.
I settled for a longer looking mullet and I like it a lot for fem and masc energy.
Have you scrolled through Pinterest for unisex hair ideas?

Very unisex are sidecuts or partly undercuts (like only a high neck outshave).

Mullets are something that really has to please the person, that's why I am often a bit sceptical if not the whole vibe is fitting.

I have a masc haircut but just shorter to nearly middle hair and gelled back is a classic unisex hairstyle.
I've always since the sides of my head completely buzzed with a long fringe on top. So on more masc days I can pull it back into a pony tail and on more fem days I can wear it down or curl our straighten it
Pixie cut would look great and maybe a short side cut.
Mullet or shag

Buzzed on one side
u look amazing, maybe a shorter wolf cut?
Undercut?
Pixie cut! There's so many different types, and you can totally find one that fits the style you're looking for!
You'd look great with a Pixie cut!
When i decided to cut my hair, I went shorter and shorter until I finally just buzz it. That was more than a year ago and now I’m experimenting as it grows in. What if I cut the sides? What if I let it all grow in evenly? What if I just trim up the back and around my ears? Trying new styles and asking male coworkers with similar hair how they style it (when they’re trying to impress someone not in our messy job xD)
Big fan of the buzz, myself. I think you'd rock it.
Undercut has been my go to for the past 3 years
I'm in the process of growing my hair out after I saw a versatile cut on this [compilation of non-binary TikToks.](https://youtu.be/impN2_2s3V8) It's an undercut that can be worn up (ponytail or man bun) or down in a bob.
I read the title wrong, thought it said ""I want my hair cut badly"", and then imagined a person with tufts of hair and bald spots everywhere
Try short at the bottom/around the neck and long on top style cuts.
Maybe getting it cut to chin length? That tends to work for me at least.
If you like versatility you could shave off the sides. the you can have the rest of your hair up for a more masc look and leave your hair down for a fem look
I'm growing my hair out to be something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V2GhF5fuvc). There's a hair 360 at 2:27, and the cut was inspired by Beck from Victorious which I think would be a good look for you! You've got a similar length and volume, but it would frame your face differently and give you lots of options to go more masc or more femme for the day
That is such a careful balance! I like to use undercuts and careful styling to make that work for myself, but there was a point at which I undercut with a ponytail, and that was entirely too masc for me.
Mullet is the closest I can think of
I, personally, am a fan of the fluffy mullet, but I'm a little biased 😅
I had the same problem with my hair. It was quite long, like halfway my back long. Then I found out I was trans, had it cut until it was halfway in my neck. Still it wasn’t what I wanted. 
So I looked for a photo of a queer celebrity online whose hair I liked, took it to the salon, and now I’m happy with it. Maybe that could work for you: look online for a photo with a haircut that you like and have it done that way.
cutting my mullet was the best decision i ever made!!! mullets 4 ever
Mullet mullet mullet
I recently referenced Bender from the Breakfast Club for myself. My hair’s not as thick so I had to alter it, but it might suit you very well!
If you’re looking for androgynous but not risking all the growth. I just did me an undercut myself, I feel it’s a good androgynous look but keeping my hair (I have locs and haven’t cut my hair in over a decade so the decision to do an undercut was a long one. I also married my lower locs so I could do my undercut without losing any whole locs)
Wolf cut!! Especially since your hair is nice and thick.
Well, if you're *brave* and/or going through a crisis, buzz it all. I may or may not have done that last January. I've been growing it out since April and I'm at an uncomfortable length but I'm trying to get it long again 🫠😊
Maybe a pixie or undercut? If you get an undercut, you can still keep the hair over top kinda long (if you like). 🤷
I made up my own cool hairstyle, a mix of what I consider fem and masc. that can always be a cool idea, but I'm sorry if that info isn't helpful
Thank you all SO MUCH!! 🖤🖤🖤🖤
I'm biased because it's my go to but a mohawk can work for anyone. Depending on the length you can actually do a few different things with it as well.

Edit: please don't get a mullet. I understand that some people get them for aesthetic reasons but the symbolism of anti-intellectualism blows me away. I don't say this as some high-minded intellectual. I'm a tradesperson and very proud of it! But there is an association between mullets and a disdain for education which just infuriates me.
You have nice looking hair, maybe do something gradual and see if your opinion changes?
Asymmetrical bob
maybe an asymmetrical pixie/mixie moment!
Maybe a pixie cute with one side shaved?
Mullet or pixie, or a slight trim with a triangle nape undercut?
May sound stupid but if you can find a chill hairdresser, ask them. That is if someone else cuts your hair. I know when i first cut my hair off I buzzed it off and went to a barber and took her advice for how to let it grow out and it looked good.
mullet is my fave androgynous haircut
I’m a fan of haircuts like Ellie from the last of us, or Korra’s shorter hair from Legend of Korra. Your hair looks thick enough that you could pair it with an undercut too, so it’d be kinda like Bo from crit role
Maybe a jellyfish cut? It's basically a bob (can be of any variety), but with a long section in the back. It's almost a mullet. One of my favorites is on [sl33zyskiz](https://www.instagram.com/sl33zyskiz/) on IG.
Classic half shaved side, undercut something to add a lil edge and contrast!
Mullet is the ultimate enby cut
I feel a mullet for you, possibly combined with an undercut.
It will keep some length and feminity but combine it with masc features and it would also fit your style :)
I’m a strong advocate of the bowl cut!
Maybe one like this? 

https://pin.it/3HRbRED

I am currently rocking this cut, and I LOVE it. It’s still a little soft, can be styled in several different ways, and with a touch of eyeliner it’s exactly the right gender energy for me.
I just got myself a mullet I’ve been wanting for years and def feel way more myself fuckin love it.
I got a wolf cut and I love it so much. Its so versatile. 10/10 reccomend
Mullets are trending right now with bangs
a buzz cut could be an interesting reset from long hair
Wolf cuts are really cool imo
wolfcut?
If u wanna keep ur length I’d suggest a shag/ wolf cut!
Pixie cut
MULLET! :)
JTT cut
Shaggy mullet or a wolf cut !!
Mullet!
The spider Gwen shaved half cut was my inspo and I'm loving it just cut shorter to look more like it but with a twist. My conservative dad who I tried to tell im nonbinary too asked me if I'm ever growing my hair back out...I said No 😑 and left after that....he knows but denies it. I have ""hidden"" rainbow stuff everywhere hehe I just got a mug and a vintage one at that. I've been looking for a 80's Korea made one with an old rainbow on it my mom had it when I was a kid ive always loved it I drank out of it in front of him his expression was epic
You can shave one side and leave the rest
full buzz cut. you only live once and it’s so freeing and beautiful in every way
Lots of nonbinary people do well with part of their head shaved.  I have an undercut, one of my friends has half their head shaved and they got a sick skull tattoo on there.  Something along those lines might work (tattoo not necessary, lol)
I always do like a deathhawk cut and it brings me such joy! Also, just saying, you'd look so good with a buzz cut.
Mullet would be my suggestion too. It's what I'm going to do if I get sick of my ridiculously long hair.
Maybe kinda similar, I’m envisioning one of those ‘long, wide’ Mohawks - there is probably a term for it, but where the middle ‘Mohawk’ part is wider than a regular Mohawk, and longer in the back, and the sides are not shaved all the way off but are cut really short. A Mo-let?

ETA: what I’m tryna say is that OP would look good with one of those cross-between-a-Mohawk-and-a-mullet haircuts.
Exactly what I was thinking
I have this cut rn and it’s awesome. I have a low fade all around and keep the top fringe long (well, long for me, anyway).
The wolf tail? Yeah I had that for a bit when my hair grew out. But all I could think of was Sokka
What.. I’m pretty sure that’s what you associate the mullet with. Pretty sure it’s just a hair cut. It only represents that to you because you’ve made it represent that.
or maybe the kids call them wolf cuts now lol
Omg you just described my hair cut for the last few years and I'm absolutely capital d Dead at MO-let because it really is such a queer/homo cut *🤣😭* deaaadddd. Thank you for coining this term ❤️
The David Beckham Fauxhawk
Exactly this!! Like a shag mullet but I think with really short sides and then shaggier and layered on the mullet part!!
Ooh I could see that. I was thinking more of Eloy at the time.
Yeah I can’t find any history relating to that myself. I looked up the history of the mullet and like you said it seems like it’s just a haircut, the only mention being in the 80’s some people wore it to signal they were lesbian
Hmm... maybe it's more of an Australian thing? Mullets seem to have come into vogue recently, but are disappearing again, but prior to a year or so ago the only people I ever met with mullets were the same people who bragged about not having read a book since school. It's definitely a trope in Australian cinema that the mulleted character is also typically the dumb one.
I've been wrong before and I'll likely be wrong again. I'd say it's a thing in Australia though."	zeyz9y	NonBinary	467	1.0	2022-12-07 11:36:18
Heads up: you may want to stay clear of the r/antiwork subreddit drama.	"Currently theres a lot of drama regarding about r/AntiWork & Fox News, which stemmed from one of the mods of the subreddit being interviewed on the channel and bombing it.

The mod who was interviewed identifies as non-binary, and in the criticism of their performance in the interview, and disappointingly but unsurprisingly, there’s a lot of enbyphobic comments that are upvoted pretty high, particularly with comments suggesting that their gender identity made them not ideal to represent the subreddit/the Reddit community for an interview as big as this. It didn’t help that their appearance was pretty dishevelled for appearing on national television, which was also negatively associated with them being non-binary.  

As an enby that’s worked in the PR industry, this was really hard to watch unfold. On one hand, the criticism of the mod’s performance was totally justified - they were clearly not the right pick for such a big spotlight and it was a PR disaster, especially with the infighting drama & the subreddit going private from the aftermath.  

But on the other hand, considering that our community is already marginalized so much in the media, things like this set us back even more - because now we have to defend ourselves that we aren’t slobs, that we can represent ourselves in the media professionally, and that we can and must be respected and taken seriously.  

So, yeah. Best to avoid getting into it, or brace yourself for the enbyphobic/transphobic comments.

Edit: this isn’t a political post at all for or against antiwork, nor am I excusing the mod because they’re NB - as I said above, their performance and their actions regarding this as a whole was just bad, and in fact, what they’ve has done nothing but hurt the NB community as well as a consequence. But many will see these events being discussed on Reddit for days to come, and there’s a lot of vile comments, projections and cheap shots on NB identity; I wanted to give a warning on the commentary, one I wish someone else told me before reading the comments on it."	"I was so disappointed that so many of the comments were transphobic and ableist.
The amount of ~~liberals~~ members who followed obvious brigading and immediately went into transphobic / ableist remarks and ideas was beyond disheartening. As a Nonbinary anarchist I was appalled and just deeply disappointed with how everything went, especially since r/workreform seems to be getting the flow of old members even though it's already a classist, Capitalist licking subreddit. 

What angers me more is what you've described, how people are using the mod as a reason to become enbyphobic, and it sucks to watch two communities I'm in slide back as if all our education was just trashed.
This may be selfish, but I really hate the fox news crowd becoming more aware of the existence of non-binary people and being trans in general. Them being more aware of my existence is fucking terrifying, since I live in the south. Some dude here shot a trans woman for approaching him in a club.  I'm completely stealthing my transition, yet I'm getting clocked by cis people for subtle things they used to not pick up on. I don't know if things are just getting worse, or we're experiencing the death throes of transphobia like the mid 2010s when homophobia was intensifying as the right to marry was front and center of the national debate.
Thanks friend. I happen to frequent that subreddit so I appreciate the heads up. ✌🏼
Please do not engage with fascist. Fox is nothing more than a televised version of the Dearborn Independent. With that said, thanks for the heads up.
The ableism everywhere too is just disgusting, I'm just overall disgusted with people right now. Why is it so god damn fucking hard for people to criticize without being a fucking bigoted asshole? 

The interview was a mistake and it shouldn't of happened 

Ta fucking dah look how hard that was.
Yeah, got walloped by that this morning. The transphobic and enby phobic comments were everywhere and the cis were like “why are we being censored!?!”
Trueoffmychest has a lot of transphobia too, and those posts keep getting recommended to me even though I’m not on it :((
Check out r/maydaystrike r/debtstrike r/lostgeneration r/workersstrikeback r/workreform ✊🏻✊🏼✊🏽✊🏾✊🏿
fox chose them so they could mock the movement on tv and discredit the work that all these ppl have been doing. fuck fox news
By many accounts the mod had no business trying to speak on behalf of the sub, and both the mod as an individual and the mods as a group were pretty obviously not prepared for the interview or the extremely predictable fallout of drawing the attention of a fox audience to a leftist sub. 

However...

>But on the other hand, considering that our community is already marginalized so much in the media, things like this set us back even more - because now we have to defend ourselves that we aren’t slobs, that we can represent ourselves in the media professionally, and that we can and must be respected and taken seriously. 

Please keep in mind that **this** is **not** a valid angle of criticism of this individual. Trans people are not responsible for the transphobia other people enact and then blame them for. Don't fall for respectability politics, it's a losing game.
Seems like they’ve locked it down temporarily trying to fix this?
No one's actions ""set us back"". White cis men have raped and murdered their way since whiteness was invented and they never have to justify themselves. 

Patriarchy will never give us respect because it is built not to.
Did antiwork get taken down?
[deleted]
On my feed the post above this is litterally a post in r/antiwork going off
Oh my god this keeps getting worse.
This implies I would want to get involved with literally any subreddit drama.
This whole thing has really been a shit show for enbies, and leftists. I don’t trust this new Work Reform Reddit as far as I can throw it. None of the mods there have ever been active in any other organizing, or left leaning communities, as far as I can tell. Plus, the fact that the transphobic garbage is already front page tells me that we’ve already fed the movement to the libs at best, but probably libertarians or alt-right in reality.

The person who got interviewed was handpicked by Fox to make the movement look bad- to the bad faith people for transphobic, and ableist, reasons that are nonsense. Then, actually sadly, for the good faith people just seeing someone absolutely not prepared to answer questions, nor be representative of an average worker’s struggles as far as working conditions, and exploitation.
Am I the only one who thinks they were calm, reasonable, and stood their ground while that news guy just mocked them? I don't see what the huge problem is with their interview. The ""laziness is a virtue in this society"" could be taken out of context, sure, but I don't think it was that bad overall
Edit: deleted comment bc I’m a dumbass lmao I didn’t realize what it looked like when a sub went private, yeesh it is all over my subreddits
hm... didn't noticed anything about enby stuff, just the issues with how they clearly wen't prepared for the interview, and that they ended up making r/antiwork sound like a bunch of slobs, It felt like they didn't understand both sides of the sub, and worst part, I can't tell wich side, making it feel like the mod is just an Idiot who doesn't understand the sub...

now they're being super agressive to anyone who mentions it negitivly, making the sub feel like a complete lie of what it was made for, and a lie for what it accepted becoming.

if your wondering what I mean by both sides, r/antiwork was originaly made as an Anarchist sub, but with all the issues it became a sub for people who want to be treated better at their jobs too, and now its this...
[removed]
Okay so to make sure I speak of the mod properly, do they go by they/them, she/her, etc.?
Don’t go to the dad joke subreddit post on it either. Comments are a cesspool. I go there for shitty puns, not transphobia.
Everything is a dumpsterfire so I haven't wanted to ask due to whatever shitty responses I'd receive, but are their pronouns they/them? I just want to be able to talk about this without misgendering the mod but I've seen every pronoun under the sun being used for the person unfortunately.
Ugh, so much misgendering. So much ""embarrassing because nonbinary"". Ew.
I'm just gonna not be on reddit for awhile. This has affected way too many of the subs I frequent. I'm tired of seeing manipulative conservative tactics being used to distort the public view of us.
I had to go look, and I felt like jumping off a bridge for a few hours.
Isn’t that mod a rapist? The stuff they posted…
Saw a comment in a post relating to this incident about how the trans community has been “infiltrated” by “radicals and tucutes”.

By “radicals” they mean anyone who has a spine about their identity and by “tucutes” they mean any trans person that isn’t binary and/or visually doesn’t conform to gender norms.

It’s fucking depressing to see how upvoted it was.
r/workreform mods seem to be (at least they claim to be) deleting transphobic comments as much as they can. r/antiwork is an absolute mess right now, but most people are mad at the mods for different reasons right now. There’s a massive influx of attention on both r/antiwork and r/workreform (sort of the de facto replacement for antiwork) and it’s hard to catch all of the transphobic remarks. But it will die down.

Don’t let this turn you off from any subs entirely! Just be careful for the next few days until the massive attention spike has died down. If you are a leftist and are, in concept, pro-antiwork, then you need to remain focused on the goal.

Until then, there are loads of safe(r) spaces. r/latestagecapitalism r/maydaystrike r/lostgeneration r/workersstrikeback r/debtstrike seem to be safe for the most part. r/latestagecapitalism is particularly safe from what I’ve noticed.

Much love to everyone and take care of yourselves!
>particularly with comments suggesting that their gender identity made them not ideal to represent the subreddit/the Reddit community for an interview as big as this.

I don't think this is transphobic. In an interview with Fox, you need to pick someone that will remove as many barriers as possible between yourself and their audience. Being nonbinary is  a barrier to that. The world isn't a certain way just because we want it to be.
[deleted]
SAME
I was just talking about this on that sub the other day. There are so many class reductionists who say ""we can't focus on X rights, only the class war"" and then do the work of the ruling class \*for\* them. Because they are unwilling to analyze their own personal bias and bigotry from growing up in these systems of abuse. I just don't know what it will take to get these people to really truly \*understand\*.
This is the hardest part for me. I hate seeing people flood into this barely established place that’s hyper reactionary in a way that aligns with the transphobic garbage. Like, we were so close. So close to having a movement where the left kinda controlled the conversation in a overwhelmingly productive, and generally inclusive, way.

I don’t trust this new sub. It popped up too fast, became the default over more established options too quickly, and none of the tiny group of mods have history in any left or workers movements as far as I see. Plus, it’s already got soooo much garbage in it. I’m just sad for the movement.
Lol every time some one posts the work reform subreddit I point out that I’m in anti work to abolish work… sorry I don’t want to reform capitalism liberals. 🙃
i dont think i could handle it if it werent the death throes.
Please stay safe! If it makes you feel any better, Fox itself hasn’t said much about their gender identity. The average viewer, both fortunately and unfortunately, sees them as cisgender.
Likewise. Thanks OP
I wanted to comment that on every awful transphobic and ableist comment but it wouldn’t be worth my time.
If you hit the three dots on a recommended post there should be an option to show fewer posts from the subreddit. I've unfortunately gotten several outright disgusting suggestions from following links to read comments.
The first four are good, the last one is very new and I've seen some questionable things highly upvoted on it.
Stay away from workreform, shit is fishy AF.  [https://twitter.com/\_saintdrew/status/1486516990223204352?s=20](https://twitter.com/_saintdrew/status/1486516990223204352?s=20)

I also heard they are transphobic from another sub, though I don't have proof. It's just...super fishy
r/anarchism is also worth checking out if you haven’t already
Yeah this is an easy thing to fall into, and I get how it is.

But some of us are ""slobs"", some of us can't ""represent ourselves in the media professionally"", and we *still* should be respected and taken seriously. Even if that was true of all of us, we would still deserve respect! Respect is not earned based on dressing ""nicely"" or being ~~a good capitalist drone~~ effective in the workplace.

We have to defend ourselves because people are transphobes who look for literally any excuse to justify it, not because someone happened to give them the excuse they were searching for. They did not ""become"" enbyphobic OP. They already were.
This.

This whole situation has made me even more afraid to speak publicly as an enby because it's clear that if the right attacks me (which they will), leftists on ""my side"" will likely join in. 

Criticizing the mod for representing the group without their agreement, or being unprepared, okay. Criticizing them for who they are, great way to divide the community and harm thousands of bystanders.
Nah, just let it roll by.
It doesn’t matter if they’re a horrible person, you can criticize someone without being transphobic or an ableist.
They/them is probably a safe bet as it tends to be neutral.
You’ve said what I’ve been wanting to say all night but didn’t know how to phrase it. Unfortunately there’s not enough self-inflection in our community to know that we still have the ability to marginalize others within our own community - being marginalized by those outside of it doesn’t eliminate that.
Oof the post the other day from the bootlicker who said we shouldn’t gatekeep the movement 🙄.  Like no we can hate on cops and fascists and land lords, thank you. I hate people trying to blame queer people for splitting the movement rather than transphobes.
Two mods work for a bank, one is a techbro at startups, and they also run some weirdly Islamophobic league of legends subs.
Yeah I did that but it’s such a widely known sub that it disappoints me to see that. It’s all cis people being annoyed because (one) non-binary person politely asked them to use they/them pronouns and apparently that’s the most annoying thing on earth :(
I agree. It seems to have the most momentum, but I put the subs aimed at action first. I put r/workreform last. I’m not going to outright poo poo it, because diversity of tactics and meeting people where they are at is important, but you’ll find me on r/maydaystrike more.
Cool. But the top comments that were highly upvoted had no mention of transphobia/ableism and were genuine criticisms but still were permabanned. We cant just chalk antiworks implosion on transphobia/ableism. Really it was powertripping mods who refused to listen to users and handed themselves over to a hostile environment then cried when the user base criticised them for taking the bait. I bet tomorrow the antiwork sub will reopen scrubbed of any post criticising the top mod who had the meltdown. Thats that, really. Do with this info what you will, friend.
[deleted]
This is how I feel about it too as an Autistic enby person, I feel like the mod just doesn't understand how any misstep as a marginalized person can hurt bypassers, a lot of high functioning autistic people do not understand that within our own community either as they platform themselves, when you have a platform. It isn't just about your demands, you have to also realize you're making it harder for people to exist in spaces when you monumentally fuck up like this. It sucks all around, and I wish we would be able to have inter-community discussions about what we need to do as  communities to make sure we do have strong visibility, and at the same time recognize that there are people WITHIN our own communities that are still more marginalized and don't deserve the pain that comes with this.
Gatekeep? Weird choice of words on their part. Aren't the transphobes, racists, ableists, etc the ones gatekeeping, really?
100%, just as a heads-up to anyone clicking it for the first time :)
This isn't a thread talking about those issues. It's a thread talking about why a trans person might not want to get involved. I took a look earlier today, and certainly saw my fair share of transphobia without a great deal of pushback. A lot of people aren't a big fan of having their personhood being called into question just because some stranger did something some other stranger disapproves of. 

Our nonbinariness isn't just real when we happen to perfectly align in our politics, and societies approval certainly isn't something to be used as a punishment if one of us does something stupid or selfish, or even downright wrong. That's what people are taking exception with your comment; not about whether or not the mod in question is or is not worthy of personal derision.
EW, sounds like you had an argument with a truscum/transmed
>Have another trans redditor arguing with me that they can’t be trans because they weren’t diagnosed trans

Remember, next time you have symptoms of a medical condition, just don't let the doctors diagnose you and you'll turn out fine :)
**THIS.**  


Its hard enough finding positive portrayal of Trans and Nonbinary to serve as role models. Thanks to the mod's careless and, quite frankly, selfish choice to interview with Fox News the floodgates have opened for all the transphobic and endophobic edgelords to force us into unflattering stereotypes of being entitled, egocentric, and self-centered.   


Their gender identity has nothing to do with their bad choices. A cisgendered mod could just as easily choose to pursue their fifteen minutes of fame at the expense of the community.   


I did observe at least one post calling out the vitriol, so there is some small comfort.
You would think so. At first I read the post and was like yeah makes sense, but in the comments the OP revealed they meant gatekeeping against bigots. The fact that we don’t want to interact with racists and transphobes is preventing them from joining the movement. It was the most ridiculous shit I ever read.

Also someone wrote we’ll always gatekeep against cops and then he tried to post some BS about calling the cops for DV situations and everyone was commenting Google 40% of police. ACAB.
Any self respecting marginalized person(that is not a pundit or media professional)  should not interact with Fox News to begin with, they will not respect us and look for any excuse to belittle us. You are making yourself and your community a target by doing so. There’s so much ableism and enby phobia because of this and now people think we’re all lazy leechers because someone can’t explain their point of view properly."	sdm9dj	NonBinary	464	0.98	2022-01-27 01:33:23
so I finally buzzed my head and I am feeling really good about it and how it fits with my gender identity (they/them)		"my first buzz cut was pretty euphoric too, and might i say it looks great on you!
nice! I love it
You look fucking stunning :)
i really want to do the same! you look awesome!

you should feel good about it, it looks amazing on you!

aaaaa you look amazing <333 so jealous
It suits you amazingly!!
Hell yeah you look awesome!!!
Woah you look great!!

"I've always struggled with feeling that I don't look ""androgynous enough"". I'm trying to remind myself that even though I generally present more femme, that doesn't invalidate my identity as a non-binary human."		"You have really beautiful eyes. 😊

“Non-binary don’t owe you androgyny” 
Wise words from a friends of mine that really stuck with me. The notion that my being more femme didn’t take away from my identity felt ground breaking. Such a simple concept, but the idea that I didn’t have to be androgynous if I didn’t want to to be valid never crossed my mind. I feel that struggle, I constantly am reminding myself that it’s okay to be femme, it doesn’t take away from anything.
From a generally femme presenting nb: you don't owe anyone anything. You are valid regardless of your presentation. And you are gorgeous.
My friend, I am nonbinary.

I also want to go on testosterone, have top surgery, poss. have lower surgery, have a beard and dem muscles. Basically, I want to present as masculine as possible, and enjoy being perceived as male/heavily masculine.

I am still nonbinary. And so are you!
Your feelings are valid! As a femme-presenting NB person, I totally feel you, as far as feeling sort of invalid sometimes. But I keep reminding myself that we’re allowed to identify however you want regardless of appearance! 😊 I’m glad that you’re able to find peace in that as well.
I feel you. I know that I'm not required or expected to be androgynous, but I WANT to. I want that look. I want people to be unsure what to call me. And the fact that I have hips from here to next Tuesday means I'll never really pull that off. But I gotta remind myself I'm still a badass.
As a somewhat transfeminine person, I agree pretty strongly that you can present as feminine and still be nonbinary. While I prefer to present as feminine in most ways, I really don’t feel right calling myself a woman, but the other binary option feels absolutely awful. 

Also, you’re fuckin’ adorable and wear those face piercings really well.
[deleted]
You are valid! You gender is valid! Your experiences are valid!
NON BINARY POWER TO YOU WIZ!
I’m coming to a place that labels are for others. I am me. I’ve worked hard to be ok with me. Currently I’m presenting femme, but I’m non-binary or agender when asked.  Because IF asked, someone is asking about me and my Id. If not asked, they can try to place me or not. 

How you look doesn’t define how you interact or feel towards your gender. It was something said to me years ago, which I didn’t fully process at the time, but it makes a lot more sense now.
I love your bridge piercing! Have a good day!
You look stunning and I am definitely getting an androgenyous vibe from this pic. Is that a to do list onyour wall? You seem like someone who puts alto of effort into how they present despite that not being wholly andydrogenous which as people have eexpressd it is totally valid to not present androgenyous as an nb or to not pass.
Challenge these thoughts that you are not ""enough""! Has anyone actually said this to you? If they do they are very rude.
It really doesn't! *consensual hugs* as a side note, you're super attractive! I hope your day improves!
As a femme-presenting NB, it helps me to keep reminding myself that “gender identity” and “gender expression” are two totally different things. When someone implies that being trans/nb means wearing dresses and makeup for AMABs and having short hair and binders for AFABs, I think of it this way - clothes, makeup, hairstyles, purses, jewelry - none of those things have an inherent gender. They’re mostly just inanimate objects. If someone says I’m cis because I’m wearing a skirt, I think about how a modern, Western interpretation of gender stereotypes doesn’t hold water throughout history. We’re just a drop in the bucket of all the peoples who’ve ever lived - in how many past civilizations have men wore skirts or jewelry, for example? How many past societies could we look back on that had totally different gender signifiers? Just because in the West in 2019, someone says that carrying a purse is “femme”, doesn’t mean that’s the case throughout the world and throughout history. Anyways, sorry for going on a rant (I’m kind of obsessed with history), but this line of thinking really helps me out a lot so I wanted to share it.
Oh you look just like a friend I had. Really good looking. Very valid

Aww thank you so much! I like that saying, too 😊 It is definitely hard to remember sometimes, I feel like I need to look more androgynous for people to take me seriously, I guess. Especially since there's only 2 or 3 people in my life who actually respect and use my pronouns, while everyone else chooses not to. But you're right, I don't have to prove myself to anyone. I am who and I am and that's good enough!
Thank you so much, I really appreciate the kind words and support. ❤️
Thank you so much for the reassurance! ❤️
You're exactly right! We don't need to prove ourselves to anyone, we just are who we are and that's okay.
Yes exactly! I want to be able to look androgynous but 97% of the time I just can't seem to pull it off. I'm trying to learn to be okay with that. We're definitely still badass though 👍
Yeah I don't feel comfortable calling myself a woman either but I guess I just feel like people won't take me seriously if I tell them I'm NB and still look really feminine. But it's not about other people, it's about me learning to be comfortable with myself. 

Thank you so much!! I used to have more but they grew out over time, my piercings are my pride and joy.
Ah thank you so so much! Means a lot ❤️
Thank you!!! Trying hard to remind myself that it's true.
THANK YOU FRIEND! Same back to you 😊
Thank you so much for the wise words. I hope I can get to that point sometime soon, too.
Thank you! Hope you have a good day as well 😊
Aw thank you! It's actually the personal bill of rights that I wrote out for myself. I learned about it in mental health treatment and it's pretty much just a nice reminder that I'm a valid person with rights to happiness, sadness, anger, etc. You're right, I do try to put a lot of effort into how I present on a daily basis.
No one has said it to me outright, no. But the fact that I am constantly reminding people in my life that my pronouns are they/them and they still choose to refer to me as she/her sure makes it feel that way.
Aw thank you so much!! You're so kind ❤️ I hope you have a good day as well!
Wow thank you so much for that insight, that is really helpful!! I never thought about it that way before but you're totally right. Thank you for sharing your knowledge, this makes me feel a lot better ❤️
Ah thank you so much ❤️
We wait to welcome you with open arms, we got coffee and cake in the back. ❤️
Well, it is difficult to change one's speech. I suppose you could try a DEARMAN conversation if these are people you know well.
☺️☺️☺️ I’m blushing
Ah yes, good ol DEARMAN. I suppose I could try that, haven't done one in a long time. I know it's difficult to change one's speech, but it's frustrating when I've been reminding people for over a year now.

Can we talk about the relation between being non-binary and being trans	"I see this issue brought up a lot in our community and I wanted to have an open discussion about it. This isn't meant to be an attack on anyone, I just want this to be a space where we can openly discuss and debate while still understanding at the end of the day you can identify how you want as long as you aren't causing harm.

Now I've often seen people say to not refer to non-binary people as trans as a blanket statement because some non-binary people don't identify as trans. This has personally never made sense to me. From my understanding, being trans just means not identifying with whatever you were assigned at birth. So you are either a cis person or a trans person. With that in mind, I never understood why a non-binary person wouldn't want to identify as trans. Because to me, all non-binary people are just objectively trans without any personal opinion attached to it.

I've heard some responses from people on this before. They usually fall into one of two categories. First is a misunderstanding of what being trans is, with reasonings that describe not wanting to do hormone therapy or not really ""transitioning"" their gender. These points don't seem fair as they come from a place of ignorance of what makes someone trans. 

The second tend to be very vague statements that to me, can sometimes come across like some sort of harbouring resentment of trans people. It's usually saying things like ""I just don't feel like a trans person"" or ""It doesn't fit my identity"". To give the benefit of the doubt, I'm sure lots of people who say this aren't coming from a malicious place or anything. But I myself and some binary trans people I know have found these reasonings to come across like trans people have to be a certain type of person or that there is something dissatisfying about being trans when it's just a moniker that you aren't a cis person.

With all that said, I made this thread to hear from people on this from all across the aisle. I don't think people who don't identify as trans are bad people or something, but it's something that just hasn't sat right with me in this community.

EDIT: I just wanted to thank everyone for the detailed responses! There are a lot of perspectives being shared here and it's a great learning experience!"	"I can see your concern, due to the enbyphobic gatekeeping in the trans community, a lot of us could feel like imposters simply for identifying as trans. I was definitely like this for a while, in 2012 I was seeing a lot more trans people online and was getting way more information I ever did about trans people before. I felt very passionately about trans rights, learned the existence of other genders which made me really happy as someone who was struggling with my gender all my life. But I felt like I wasn't allowed in trans spaces or identify as trans, thinking it would be appropriative since my gender wasn't binary. I would also see cis get thrown quite a lot too, but didn't feel like it resonated with my gender either.

It didnt take me until 2014 to finally own my transness. I'm very passionate about being trans now because of the fact I'm nonbinary, the more I engaged with the trans community, the more I advocated for nonbinary people to be given the right to claim their transness too. Thing is, I ended up learning over time that there are nonbinary people who have given genuine reasons why some of them don't like the trans label. Some have criticized that it feels like there's also a cis/trans binary being imposed on them too.

The cis/trans binary in concept is really interesting to point out, because I can see how other nonbinary people could have an issue with this. Gender is really messy, it could raise questions about not neatly fitting into definitions or categories. There are even people who have to readjust definitions to be able to fit into labels that mean a lot of significance to them. I've seen some nonbinary people not identify as trans for these following reasons.

 -Aligning closer to their birth assignment, even though that's not their gender completely. They might lack the rest of it or feel like just having that gender alone is incomplete. Like a demigirl or a nonbinary woman who was assigned female at birth might not feel comfortable being trans because they still feel like their AGAB, only more nuanced. It could get complicated calling themselves trans too if they feel really strongly about their womanhood even as a nonbinary person. If they were to call themself a nonbinary trans woman, that's going to raise some confusion, even tho nonbinary people confuse everyone all the time. More importantly it might make nonbinary trans fems very uncomfortable, which is also why they would refrain from calling themself trans. There are alternatives to this, trans masculine woman, trans neutral woman, etc. But what if they're neither of those either? I've seen this point brought up the most when it comes to some nonbinary people not being trans.

-Being agender. Of course, there definitely are agender trans people, I'm one of them as an agenderfluid person. (Leaning closer to agender) but if we were to apply ""having a gender that wasn't given to you at birth"" that's not going to sit right with some of them since there are agender people who don't consider it their gender, it's their identity. An identity with no gender, they're genderless or lack gender. So even just calling themselves transgender feels nonsensical if the gender isn't even there. With some agender people like myself, we have to alter this a bit like ""not having the gender given to us at birth"" or ""transcending the gender binary"", which makes a lot more sense. But still, there are going to be agender people who will feel at odds with the trans label since it feels very heavily gendered, they may also struggle with the cis/trans binary since so many trans people advocate ""If you aren't trans, just call yourself cis because there's no other option"" that's just straight up aphobic.

-Being bigender. I've also seen some bigender people advocating having the right to express themselves being in between cis and trans. I've even seen them coin a term to describe this, they're called cuspers. Like strongly feeling both cis women/men and trans men/women at the same time. This could apply to genderfluid too where some days they could strongly feel very cis and then other days very very trans. I've seen some cuspers say that they feel too cis with trans people and feel too trans around cis people, they feel like they don't belong in either group. Like... that's just super depressing and it's honestly made me really re evaluate how much we enforce cis and trans being the only two, super separate options that aren't allowed to mesh and mingle.

I think in terms of nonbinary people being trans or not, it all boils down to self determination. There's a whole lot of other reasons why some nonbinary people don't feel comfortable identifying as trans. We should just let them own those feelings as we can't always determine if that's coming from internalized transphobia. If it genuinely is internalized transphobia, they're going to have to come to terms with that themselves like I and many other gatekept trans people did.
I've seen a good argument about the trans identity on egg_irl.

Someone in doubt will mention not ""feeling trans"" or ""wanting to be trans.""

The counterpoint to that is no one inherently wants to be trans. People can embrace their trans identity, love who they are, and wouldn't choose to change a thing about themselves and that's wonderful. That being said, no one wakes up and thinks, ""I want to be transgender."" BUT, if asked if they could be the opposite gender (for binary trans) with no social problems, no transitioning, just waking up that way...they'd do it in a heartbeat.

Being trans in this world is scary, but if you woke up tomorrow with the physical and social gender representation that would make you happiest, would there be change?
I only feel like I’m trans by technicality. I don’t like using it as an identifier but consider myself “transneutral”. I think my beef with it is that trans language is SO associated with change from one gender to another. For me, it gives me anxiety that people will try to whittle down my AGAB if I say I’m trans. Everyone has an internal bias, even if they don’t mean to think like that. It’s uncomfortable for me to tote a trans flag around bc of this. I don’t want people to assume I’m binary in any way.
tldr; imposter syndrome made me think trans wasn’t my label 

my perspective was always ‘I understand that nonbinary is inherently trans but I don’t feel trans’ and I think that was mainly due to imposter syndrome, my brother is binary trans and I know the difficulties that’s come with for him so I didn’t want to belittle his experience or take the trans limelight in the family lol. now I’m a bit more involved in the community and it’s more obvious now, like yeah baby! I’m trans! it’s just a label that I didn’t feel like belonged to me for a while and honestly I’d still pick nonbinary over trans to describe myself but I wouldn’t be against the label trans. I think a lot of it is down to misunderstandings, as if you need to be binary and medically transition, rather than what it really is - to be any gender other than your agab
I think, in a vacuum, it's absolutely harmless for some nonbinary people to not ID as trans, and I'm sure people have valid reasons that I simply do not understand, and I don't need to in order to respect it. It is not my place to policy how other people choose to label their identity and gender. 

However, I do believe it is an exception to the rule, and that a fair number of cases it comes from internalized transphobia or misunderstandings about what it means to be trans, so I get very frustrated when it seems like every single time I describe myself as both trans and nonbinary or talk about nonbinary as a trans identity, people on reddit feel the need to show up and talk about how not all nonbinary people are trans. A newly out nonbinary person will be venting or asking about how they're not sure if they can call themselves trans and you reassure them that yes, they can call themselves trans if they want because nonbinary is under the trans umbrella and not any less trans than binary trans folks, and people will jump to ""correct"" you and it's like dude. Read the room. 

If an individual nonbinary person doesn't want to identify as trans that's 100% their choice. No one should be pressured to identify as trans if they don't want to. But that does not mean that we should be letting the belief that nonbinary people are somehow less trans than binary trans people, that transitioning is a requirement to be trans, or similar misinformation persist in our community, nor that we should stop describing nonbinary as a trans identity or under the trans umbrella, because it is, even if there are some exceptions. If you simply don't vibe w the trans label or have other reasons why it doesn't work for you, that's totally cool. But if the only reason is because you think you're not trans enough or you don't count because you are not transitioning or you don't want to be associated with trans people for some reason, then that _is_ internalized transphobia. And like, ya know, it's cool, it takes time to come to terms w that shit and u may not feel ready or comfy to ID as trans. That's fine. You don't have to. But that doesn't like... Make it any less internalized transphobia and that's not something we want to or should encourage or normalize. Those things do not make a nonbinary person Not Trans and saying they do is actively harmful and invalidating. It becomes no longer just about you, but also about all the other nonbinary people who are trans who you've just claimed aren't because they don't fit an incorrect narrow standard of what it means to be transgender.
For me, I'm technically trans, sure, but I feel very uncomfortable using it as a first descriptor because I am agender and on top of that, gender apathetic.   
   
My struggles are completely different from those who are binary trans, cis, or even someone who is also nonbinary but is trying to transition in some way. I don't have the dysphoria, I do not have any pronouns I want used for me, I'm making no effort to transition. I feel like calling myself trans would give people who mean us harm a way to attack people who need those things, even if I am under the umbrella.   
   
At the same time, I'm not cis. I don't think like a woman, my assigned gender at birth. I can't feel gender no matter how hard I try. I can't blend in with a group of ladies. It's like I fit nowhere because I simply can't feel it.   
   
If I'm not going to call myself agender, I'll usually use nonbinary. If they're ready for it, isogender.
I didn't identify as trans at first, just ""under the trans umbrella,"" whatever that means. 🤣

I DO consider myself trans now, though specifically as genderfluid AMAB, and my presentation leans androgynous/femme.

Originally, I didn't consider myself trans because I didn't feel I ""deserved"" to call myself trans. I didn't think I felt dysphoria (really, I just didn't understand that certain feelings I did have WERE dysphoria) & I don't really feel ""in the wrong body."" I didn't want to call myself trans out of respect to folks I considered ""really trans."" 

After having a couple post-op friends tell me: ""please girl, you're trans"" (or similar), I figured it was OK. And, TBH, it felt really good to hear that.
i feel like non-binary folks fall under the trans umbrella objectively, but im never going to force a label on someone. i dont think i would truly understand a non-binary person not wanting to identify as trans, but i dont care enough to push the topic, especially since it could have potential to make a person even *less* willing to accept their true self.

in the end, cis or trans, non-binary or binary, i am me, you are you. we are each our own person, and when it comes to the people around me thats more often than not as deep as it needs to go.
😮‍💨 very rarely there are people who WERE NOT assigned boy/girl by their parents. So they do not fit the definition you stated. There are sometimes intersex people who luckily did not have their genitals mutilated without their consent and were not forced to conform to being male or female. These people DESERVE the right to express themselves in the way that makes the most sense to them, without people just casually assuming that everyone must have been assigned binary like they were. Please try to keep an open mind not only to the stories people tell you, but also to all the possible stories you may never get to hear. This will give you the best understanding of the most people, without assuming things about anyone.

With all that said if there is a gray area like you hinted at of someone who was raised binary and who discovers they are not, but does not feel like they want to identify as trans, I say who cares? Really, that is such a niche issue that really does not impact anyone in any way except that singular individual. As long as they spread love to and about their trans siblings what is the problem??
I am AFAB and over the years different terms have resonated with me (nb, genderqueer, gender fluid). I don’t consider myself trans. I know technically by definition I am because I know I’m not 100% cis, but I don’t ever refer to myself as trans. That’s because to me, “transgender” implies some sort of transition, at least in my own mind. I know that that is not true and not wanting to transition does not in any way gatekeep anyone from using the trans label, but that’s how I view it for myself. Medical transition is not something I think I would want to do, at least that’s not on my mind at this point in my life. I also still really enjoy presenting feminine most days. I recognize that a big part of it is imposter syndrome, and some of it is me still trying to find my own gender and how I feel comfortable identifying, but that’s kind of where I’m at. I don’t really fall on one side or the other; I don’t reject being considered trans, but I don’t refer to myself that way
Some people don’t feel like the term trans fits them. I for one am genderless. I don’t identify as any gender
Speaking for myself only, I feel there is an etymological difference between what a term or label is defined as vs how that term may be applied societally or colloquially. Many would define my identity as demiboy/masc, but I take issue with the use of demi as it is defined etymologically as partial or to an inferior degree, ex demigod being less than godhood. I don’t feel less than masculine, my AGAB, by identifying as non-binary, I feel I am my AGAB in addition to being non-binary. Maybe that makes me an outlier, but for me it is 2 equal sides of the same coin, neither less nor more. 

Trans- etymologically means across, beyond, through, ex transatlantic, transference, transportation. If you are referring to trans as being the flux or act of defining identity from what you were assigned to anything other than it, then I could understand inclusion of non-binary under trans. Colloquially as it has been typically noted as a shift from one binary definition to another, I think that has caused a lot of confusion. 

Although it’s funny…In writing/researching this I think it just made me agree more with non-binary inclusion under trans than disagree, at least within my definition above…language is a funny, silly, fickle thing.
Identity can be prescribed or chosen. I think most nonbinary people are against prescribed identity, so I don't see why any of us would push a label on someone else. None of us want a label pushed on us...

Trying to understand someone's choice in this regard is akin to binary people trying to understand us. That can be pretty crappy, specially if they work from their own perspective and speculate on how we *should* feel. So maybe let's not do that about each other.
One way I look at it is that agender people may identify as being under the NB umbrella - if someone has no gender, can they really be expected to relate to a gender label?
Reasons I have heard in argument that not all nonbinary people are trans: 

\-Some nonbinary experiences closely relate to binary trans experiences and some are very different. If its very different, they feel like they are overstepping and claiming a trans experience when they do not have it. They dont want to speak for binary trans people or for trans nonbinary people. 

\-They are close to their AGAB on the spectrum or partly/sometimes identify as their AGAB

&#x200B;

Personally I think if we are creating a strict definition (which its totally ok not to follow the strict definition) non-binary people are trans. Cis people always/fully identify with their AGAB. (I added always to consider genderfluid people, not people who once thought they were trans and no longer are). Yes binary people have a different experience but you can be under the same label and still not overstep and speak for binary trans people.   


I've met a lot of bisexual people who didnt feel ""bisexual"" enough to call themselves that. I knew they technically were but they called themselves straight. I think a lot of queer people feel pushed out of the community because they arent gay/trans enough. Unfortunately some people do really make it a competition.
I'm trans. It makes no sense not to be. 

However let it be said that I don't feel very included by some trans communities. This doesn't apply across the board, and there are some broad trans communities that I have been a part of that have included both binary and nonbinary trans people, and I have felt comfortable in them. 

But there are some that I don't get on well with. I think there is a strain of trans culture which is quite binarist, and generally focused on simply transitioning, and being a good man or woman, stereotypes, patriarchy and all. Even if they are nominally inclusive of nonbinary people, I just find I can't relate to people in that type of mindset.

So yeah, despite that, I am trans, and I regularly use the term to describe myself. Nonbinary people fit the definition, and aside from that, our oppressions are very clearly related and intertwined. And trans liberation is our liberation, even though there are some areas of difference (such as legal gender).
I figure for some NB people not IDing as trans comes from impostors syndrome, which is not alleviated through definitions of words but through granting confidence. In my experience, there used to be hostility in trans spaces for NB people (maybe not anymore, I haven't been paying attention, but this experience is where I'm coming from) so I can easily understand feeling like an impostor and rationalizing it with the arguments you bring up. Feeling like ""being cis"" is dead wrong, but ""being trans"" isn't quite right either, instead trying to find a third thing to ""be"". (Quotation marks because I'm not confident in my wording.) The conversation, from an emotional standpoint, can then become ""come back to us so we can continue berating you"" for the NB person, even if it's really not that at all and it's not something that would ever occur to you, personally, to do to another trans sibling.

Now this is obviously not the experience for all NB people, and ultimately if it is what a person is feeling, it's on them to resolve their hurting and come back to (and stand with) the people they belong with, realize there's much more to the trans community than whatever loud minority's convinced them they don't belong. I wouldn't try to approach it so logically, though.
As an old cis guy with a non-binary child, my understanding was that non-binary was under the ""trans umbrella"" so to speak. Obviously I'm not speaking as an authority or subject matter expert, just an old dog trying to learn new tricks.
I identify as trans-nonbinary, but I'm not really bothered by nonbinary folks who don't identify as trans. Mainly because it's none of my business unless they want to tell me.

From what I can tell the nonbinary/ agender/ genderqueer/ etc, people who don't identify as trans, it's less of them not feeling like the gender they were assigned and more of them feeling like that specific gender, if that makes sense.
I'll chime in: I'm an agender person, so i don't have a gender. tbh non-binary also doesn't always feel right as a label to me. for some people, like me, it's hard to see ourselves as trans or even enby when you don't feel like you have a gender at all.

with that, sometimes it feels like being an outlier and, at least for me, it feels like you aren't represented in trans communities when you aren't binary, and that could also have something to do with it.

at the end of the day, labels are up to the individual. non-binary people have a very unique relationship with gender and it's a bit presumptuous to assume we'd all identify with one overarching identity.
When I call myself trans, I feel like I'm almost like... Appropriating the experiences of binary trans people. I don't experience much dysphoria, if at all. I don't have the same experiences a binary trans person does, and never will. I don't face the same societal pressures and the same discrimination because I can still tolerate being perceived as my AGAB (Though I don't prefer it.) It feels disingenuous to call myself trans. I do speak for myself only, though, anyone can use any label they're comfortable with.
Intersex people who identify as non-binary exist. They can identify as both non-binary and cis.

But, for enbies who were assigned m/f and reject the trans label, some of it may be internal bias. Some of it may be not fully understanding that trans means your gender and AGAB don't match. It could be that it simply doesn't click that they, personally, are trans. Or they could feel ""not trans enough.""

For me, it's ""I'm trans the same way all squares are rectangles or both salsa and guacamole are \[debatably\] fruit salads"" (ie ""I'm trans by technicality"").
I’m a non binary person and I don’t like calling myself trans because I don’t like the label on me specifically. It’s like how some people prefer to not use a label or use instead of lesbian the terms gay,homosexual, or sapphic. I personally don’t experience dysphoria which is what I associate with being trans. Being trans feels icky to me the same way being a guy feels icky to me or being straight feels icky to me. Nothing against those people it just doesn’t fit me personally. I heavily prefer to use the term gay instead of calling myself a lesbian because it feels like it fits me so much more and it’s a lot more comfortable to me and it’s the same thing with being trans! I just don’t want to call myself trans and i think a little bit of imposter syndrome might kick in if I did call myself trans

This is my reasoning, ty for reading!

Edit: I saw a person here give examples of the argument and I agree with both of them: I don’t want to take away from and speak for trans people when I haven’t had most of their big experiences, and I identify as a gender very similar to my AGAB sooo yea
I myself am nonbinary and transfeminine. There’s more to that, obviously (people are delightfully complicated), but that’s me. Transgender critical theory suggests that you are who you say you are, and that is allowed to change. I love that, and as a queer therapist in training, and a social worker, and a former political activist, I have taken as a personal ethos to look for guidance to the people being oppressed. So. You are who you say you are. That is allowed to change. Love you!
I am non binary person who does not identify as trans, I also do not identify as cis. I just don’t want a label assigned to me like it has been my whole life. If other people see me as trans or cis that’s their business and I don’t care, but I will not claim either of those labels. I’m a woman and I’m not a woman. If I could also be a man I would, but I was socialized as a girl and men intimidate me, also I’m not a shapeshifter and I don’t want to be perceived as trans because from what I’ve observed, being trans is HARD. I don’t want to defend myself all the time. The benefit would not outweigh the cost for me as I’m not that invested. I’m fine with the body I’m in now after a long time of hating it, I still have my hang ups but that’s more so about my dysmorphia, so unrelated. Also, I hate the idea of gender overall. For some reason the whole topic kind of makes me uncomfortable(with myself, not other people), I wish I could have no knowledge of gender at all and just be. But I cannot, so accepting what I’ve been given while trying to be myself at the same time is the closest I can get to blissful ignorance.
Just like how gender is often thought of as a continuum between male --> female, I personally think of cis --> trans this way as well. Yes cis and trans are opposites, but that doesn't mean there isn't going to be something in the middle that combines qualities from both. Nonbinary might be somewhere in the middle of the continuum, where agender might lie outside of it entirely. Everyone will have different ideas of where they would fit into the picture.  


Whether someone identifies as trans AND nonbinary is their own thing, but in my vocabulary trans means ""opposite"". I have a background in organic chemistry, which I'm assuming has heavily influenced my word usage.

&#x200B;

In organic chemistry you can have a double bond in a cis configuration or a trans configuration. OR you can have a completely different molecule, like a benzene ring. I've always thought of myself as being a different molecule entirely :). I was nonbinary before it was even a word on the internet, so I guess I needed my own ways of making sense of what I was feeling haha. I've never felt trans, because trans means opposite and I'm not opposite- I'm somewhere in the middle.
I dont wanna go detailed explaining why and stuff. Instead ill say this: Let people be who or what they want to be.... identity are terms of definition.
I just don't feel like I relate to the trans experience a lot, mostly because I could perfectly live the rest of my life as my AGAB, although it would be rather annoying. 

I like to describe myself as 'just non-binary'. Like, I'm not a man or a woman, I'm non-binary. I'm not cis or trans, I'm non-binary

If someone asks a question to 'trans people' in general I'd probably answer it anyways because I think my experience as not cis would still count most of the time, depending on the context
I only use the trans label for myself when I’m using it as an umbrella.
I don’t like labels. Sure, technically I might be trans, but there are days where I feel like my AGAB, so I don’t identify as cis or trans.
I personally identify as non-binary but not trans. I define cis as identifying with your assigned sex and gender at birth and trans as not identifying as your assigned sex and gender at birth. I don’t identify with my assigned gender (agab) but I feel at home in my given body. I don’t feel that I would feel more comfortable or at home in my body if my sex were different. I am female, but I’m not a woman. I’m open to questions or education on this if I’m mistaken on any information.
People like to categorize things; it's just a thing we do as a species. Transgender is one label we've created to describe not being the gender you were assigned. No more, no less. Because of the personal nature of how different people view themselves and how limited language is, I tell people that the label is there if they want it.  The labels are good ways to tell others how you view yourself. Gender is personal; use what makes sense to you

For reference I'm nonbinary *and* trans (among other things)
It’s a really important discussion, for so long I was confused about my identity because I felt ‘trans’ and associated with trans experiences, but I also didn’t like the idea of binary trans-ness and therefore felt I couldn’t identify as trans because I didn’t want to transition and take hormones etc. My own ignorance of what trans is and what makes people trans meant I was unable to realise the truth about myself for quite a long time.
I don't care what reasoning someone has for not wanting to take on the trans label. I get that some people might not want to. Especially the people I know who have taken on the label of non-binary as a stand against gender roles (and yes, I do actually know some people who have told me this. It does happen.) The thing that annoys me is when people equate only binary trans people to being trans. Like, bruh, I've gone through and am going through medical transition and the majority of people I know who have been doing it and have gone through the most are non-binary people. Not that that's what makes someone a ""valid"" trans person, but that's usually the assumption that these types of people are operating off of. So like, yes, non-binary people can be trans.
I used to not identify as trans, and it was some internalized transphobia for me. I didn't feel like I was trans ""enough"" to count. After a while, I became more confident in my identity and learned for myself that there's no requirement to being trans. I do still primarily identify myself as nonbinary to cis people just for convenience, since many will make binary assumptions if you only say trans.

Personally, I use trans/transgender to include the whole community and I think that's okay. I don't push anyone to ID as trans if they don't want to though. If it is from internalized transphobia then pushing wouldn't help anyways.

I think the main thing to think about re: including nonbinary in trans is your audience. For example, if you are running a survey you should be clear about what you're asking. If you ask if respondents are transgender assuming this includes nonbinary, you may skew your data. If you're hosting an event for trans people, saying ""trans and nonbinary"" may be more welcoming for those who don't identify as trans. (Ex: Like for me, things marketed as ""transmasc"" I don't really feel like are for me even though \*technically\* I fall under it.. but I consider myself more transneutral or however you want to say it.. so I don't feel particularly comfortable going to something just labeled transmasc)
Thank you for posting this. It's making me realize that perhaps this opinion of mine is rooted in internalized transphobia. That feels so weird to say to me but I need to get used to it! After coming out, I was struggling with this, and my cis friend said that I wasn't trans and that it was ""different"". She's often a voice of reason so I think I gave too much weight to that. I recently heard my trans friend call me trans and it felt weird but also, it really is just correct, isn't it? Anyway, this got me thinking and I think its putting me on a better path. Thank you!
I can only speak for myself on this, but when I was first figuring out that I was non-binary I felt a lot of guilt in regarding myself as trans. This led to me not wanting to use that label. I simultaneously felt that non-binary people who identified as trans were valid, and also that if I identified as trans then I was taking up space in a community I had no right to. I think I was scared because I had seen so many binary trans people deny that being non-binary was valid. It took time for me to become comfortable enough with myself to acknowledge that for me, being non-binary is trans and I have as much right to exist within my gender identity as anyone else. 
I mean hell, I’m not cisgender. I’m not a woman. I don’t feel like a man either. 
Again I can only speak for myself and my own past reasons. For others it may be more nuanced
I'm enby and I don't identify as trans.  My experience with gender does not exclude my assigned gender at birth.  I would never try to take that label from someone but trans just doesn't feel correct for me.  I haven't changed anything, I've only added.  I don't think of myself as cis either, cis and trans is just another binary I feel I don't belong to.
I prefer to call myself non-binary over trans because I feel like most people automatically think ‘binary trans’ when they hear the word transgender. Yes, by being non-binary I am technically transgender, but calling myself non-binary feels a little more accurate
I just really dislike applying labels to myself in general. I can go past a list of labels, including enby sub-labels, and feel like 'not really', 'not really', 'not really', etc. I'm just me, and I'm more than happy to just exist and not put a new set of expectations or arbitrary definitions on myself. I'm enby first and foremost.

It's been put more eloquently by others here, but additionally I really dislike the binary cis/trans distinction. The way its often being used gives me the feeling that one is either cis, or some varied form of trans. I don't feel it's very inclusive language, in the sense that it doesn't really include the different ways in which people can be cis. Or what about people who feel they are neither, or somewhere in between.
While I personally do refer to myself as trans and non-binary (partly because I like straightforward definitions), it feels equally valid to choose not to use the term ""trans"". After all, we don't use man or woman to describe ourselves because of our own associations and understandings of the meanings with those words, despite others disagreeing with us... So if someone feels trans describes someone they're not, that's for them to decide
""Now I've often seen people say to not refer to non-binary people as trans""

I personally have not seen anyone say that but I believe you. (After all, just because I haven't seen it doesn't mean it's not real!)

But I have thoughts about this. And I find that statement really stupid. Non-binary falls under the trans umbrella and I personally identify as trans and non-binary and I'd feel pretty insulted if someone said to me to not refer to non-binary people as trans. Because I am right here. I exist. Please DO refer to me as trans (and non-binary).
No. People aren't 'objectively' any gender identity, because gender is a social construct, and people are free to identify as who they are, always. It doesn't matter if my identity 'doesn't sit right with you.' That's actually kind of selfish and rude, although you may not have intentions of being so.
Why force people into the trans/cis binary?
I think you bring up some good points. 

But you’re not seeing it from the non binary perspective. 

The reason some enbies don’t like or want to use the term trans is for the same reason a lot of bi folks don’t feel part of the gay community: that community often invalidates their sexuality and demands that they commit to being ‘gay or straight’. Which isn’t right or fair. 

Non binary folks get similar treatment from a vocal subset of the trans community, where they are often denied validity and expected to transition to a binary form of being trans or face rejection. 

As a non binary person myself, I’ve experienced this quite a bit in online spaces. 

I agree with you, being non binary is a form of being trans. But I don’t self identify with the term or advertise myself publicly as such because I often don’t feel welcome at all in trans spaces. 

I don’t resent trans people. But the reality is being bi and non binary, I’m not welcome in, or widely accepted by either the gay or trans communities. 

If you want non binary folks to embrace the term trans, fine, but also campaign for trans people to welcome *us*. 

Because the gods honest truth is that a large number do not.
I don't like IDing as trans because cis and trans is just another binary that far too many people are trying to force on the group that rejects said binary. It's stupid and y'all are far too dismissive imo
I find as I get older I enjoy this type of conversation less and less. 

There used to be a kind of academic glee in hashing out the grey zones, coming up with new terminology where it was lacking, etc. 

But now I'm just tired lol. 

Now that the self-exploration is not giving me that oxytocin, I find myself more frustrated by academic discussions of gender and identity. 

It feels like work I'm expected to do for society's sake, and like I've got this job that I'm expected to do even though I'm not making new friends or getting paid. 

Anyway, to me, the definition of trans is ""not exclusively a man nor exclusively a woman"". Because the word trans is more about what you are not rather than what you are. 

So, don't have a gender? No problem, you're not exclusively a cis man or cis woman, gtg. You have a cis aligned gender some of the time, or only sort of? No problem, same deal. 

I do understand the concern about internalized transphobia, and that is definitely an issue. Trans people aren't popping out of the womb-- or our eggs-- with everything figured out. That's normal to me. 

But non-shitty reasons to not ID as trans do exist, seen a lot from other comments here, and it is, imo, bad faith to dig into someone's identity because you suspect they have work to do. (Unless you're super close, obviously friends can help each other grow. Strangers on the internet, probably not as effective and more potential for foot in mouth disease.)
The thing that’s important here is not how I define ENBY or Trans.  It’s how the person I’m talking to defines it for themselves that matters.  And that probably is not the same for everyone, so my go to is this: respect how the other identifies.  I don’t think you can go wrong with this approach.
I agree with all of this. In my view and understanding, my non-binary gender identity qualifies me as trans, because I certainly was not assigned either of these words at birth. I think you're right for the most part about NB people having an aversion to claiming the word ""trans"" for reasons like you listed, but so many of them are very very young. They're not just new to understanding the world of gender but just new to understanding the world.
I identify as nonbinary, but I don’t identify as trans. 
I don’t suffer from body dysmorphia and I’m very comfortable with my body. However the concept of gender is something that has always felt restrictive (since I was a lil kid), gender is something I have trouble understanding, as a neurodivergent person the concept has just always seemed foreign to me. Identifying as nb has been freeing. I am able to step out of something that made me uncomfortable my entire life, and made it harder for me to manage/understand/accept my disability. Me being nonbinary is more about the way my divergent brain experiences the world, my lack of comprehension surrounding social norms and society, it allows me not to feel the need to mask as much, and helps the world around me make a little more sense.

In the other hand, the label trans is something I’ve always perceived (perhaps mistakenly) as being about both how you feel in your body and who you are. It always seemed linked to having an understanding of the binary, may the individual be somewhere in the middle of that binary, outside of it, or in the polar opposite of where they were assigned to be at birth. 

I know the trans experience varies for each individual, and that nonbinary is a part of the trans umbrella. I just never felt like I belonged with the trans label due to how connected my gender identity (and general perception of gender) is to my disability. Please feel free to educate me about this and/or share your perspective on it, specially if you are neurodivergent as well. Just please be kind and remember if you are neurodivergent, our experience too varies for each individual.
I’m sure academically I’m probably trans just by virtue of being NB since it’s “under the umbrella”.

But personally I don’t identify as such. I’m not in the business of policing anyone, so making a rule about it doesn’t much interest me. I figure it’s all up to the individual.  

I think maybe I find it inauthentic to me because the only reason I’m not “identifying with my assigned gender at birth” is because arbitrarily in my culture/time doesn’t recognize my gender as standard. Other times and places in their way might have. Flimsy reasoning, I know since we can’t change the rules of the game just because we don’t like general consensus— but at the same time it’s what is in my heart, so it works for me.
Admittedly, it took me a while to accept the label transgender. 

TL;DR I never felt like I had ""transitioned"" until it got out at work that I started T and started to experience bullying, and then professional retaliation. 

My biggest hesitation was not feeling ""trans enough"" when I had no gender-related medical interventions. And as someone who responds to all pronouns and whose family was neither volatile nor welcoming to coming out, I wouldn't have said that I had experienced social transitioning like a large proportion of trans people. The family just never brought it up again. And I wasn't forcibly feminized growing up. Thankfully many close friends and colleagues have been amazing and use they/them pronouns and speak with me in ways that makes me feel valued and respected. 

Unfortunately I had to come to terms with the identify transgender when I (assistant manager, Starbucks) began to medically transition and faced harassment at work. I had begun taking testosterone, and the first week I started induced a period and cramping, I ended up needing to call in someone to cover me. My co-manager (not my boss) confronted me in person the next day at work. She asked why I was sick, I told her I had some unusual cramping due to a change in medications. She told me that I need to let her know if I am changing my medications (WTF?!) and that if this ""change of mine"" is going to cause problems at work we need to talk about it. I had had a few problems with this co-manager in the past about crossing legal boundaries with our employees and I said, ""Actually, NO. In no way are you entitled to my private medical information! How can you even insinuate that you are? That is illegal, and unprofessional.""

She made a comment about how, ""You're just not the person I thought you were."" And walked away.

AND THEN, she refused to talk to me while at work for 2 straight 8 hours days! Literally our jobs required us to collaborate constantly and run meetings together. AND, then there was this employee of hers who she always warned stirred drama, joined her side and also gave me the silent treatment. The thing is I am also the supervisor of that employee, and so when she wouldn't respond to me (same silent treatment) I asked if she was feeling well, and that I am feeling like she is trying to avoid me and I wanted to check in. I shit you not she said she was uncomfortable working around me because the other manager was uncomfortable. Turns out one of the two people who knew I was going to start T had spilled the beans at my workplace.

I had never been put into such an icky and transphobic situation. I was shocked that this person who I had gotten along with well enough just turned on me, and even brought others along her side. I contacted our boss, and I told her what happened. She said she would transfer me out of the store in a month. In that month I tolerated so much bullying and harassment... There was an employee who is a trans man and he broke my heart because one day were were alone in the breakroom, and he paused then said ""You have no idea what she says about you when you're not in the room."" And I just said, ""it's probably for the better. I don't care for rumors"" But in all honesty it would have just broken me, I couldn't hear any more of it. 

After a month, they replaced me with a different manager and sent me to a different store... and then to a different store... and then back to a different store. I got bounced between stores downtown every couple of weeks. And even if the schedule was made incorrectly before I got there, I was responsible for the fallout. I was ignored during district meetings, and my boss would give me conflicting feedback during our 1:1's. 

My last week of work, I was doing interviewing and hiring (our district had an employee deficit so I did this often) but my elected barista trainer decided she wasn't ready to train. I said no worries, training is a privilege (with a $ bonus) and I won't make someone do it if they don't want to. Halfway through the training, the manager who would be receiving this new barista comes into my store after my work day ends, talks to the original barista trainer, calls me saying great news I convinced so-and-so to do the training. And I had to call and ask him why he felt it was necessary to go into my store and make changes without talking with me. That my partner CHOSE to not train in this situation, and I am respecting her choice. 

When I brought this up to my boss she told me that ideally I wouldn't be the one training partners. And I said yes I agree, which is why the last 15 employees hired had independent trainers at their home stores, that occasionally there is an exception and to prevent more hurdles I decided to take on this brief commitment rather than create an awkward training situation for a new employee. She said I need to become comfortable making employees uncomfortable, so I quit. 


I went into management at Starbucks because my hubs lost his work during the pandemic, but I have a dual-degree in biology and psychology. I went from working at the University (w/barista side gig) to full-time work to support our home. Until I began to medically transition, I was treated respectfully, after that, holy shit. It was like night and day. It would almost be funny if it wasn't so disgusting. 

Thankfully, before I closed that I door I made sure to take the rest of the garbage out. Both my co-manager and district manager no longer work for the company either, they were terminated/resigned 2 months after I left. I don't know the specifics, but that's fine by me.  ; )

Sorry that was a long post, thank you to anyone who took the time to read my angry trans origin story. I'm doing much better now! Hubs gets to be breadwinner now that he has work, and I'm resuming graduate studies!!
This disconnect about what counts as “trans” is one of the reasons I continue to prefer associating with nonbinary community despite increasing evidence that I’m actually just transfemme. I don’t identify with masculinity at all anymore. But the gatekeeping I’ve found in so many trans communities really turns me off. Some of them won’t accept you unless you’re going “all the way” with medical and surgical procedures, even though that’s not an option for many for reasons beyond their control. 

I’m just so sick and tired of people in the LGBTQ+ community excluding others for petty reasons. The entire GSRM community should be banding together to support one another against political and social persecution, not squabbling over who belongs. If you’re not conventional cishet, **you belong**. If you’re cishet but an ally, **you’re welcome to join us**. It really should be that simple.
I'm enby and I still face harsh transphobia just as much as any binary trans person. I've heard awful things said to my face, and behind my back. If another enby doesn't identify with the trans identity, it's not really any of my business, but I cannot fathom it because we face the same discrimination.
Solely from my perspective as an AFAB enby who will likely never will look masculine or even androgenous (yet doesn't have that much body dysmorphia) and happily embraces a lot of their femm, masc, and neither qualities:

I consider myself trans because this is definitely a different experience than cis people get. 

No qualms with the people who don't feel like it fits tho. Some folks (especially on the internet) sometimes get overly strict/policing around labels, and I want everyone to have more flexibility without being made to defend themselves.
For me… as someone who’s feeling on their gender (i use she/they) pronouns has evolved and changed idk it’s kinda internal. I feel like part of me was struggling to not think in the binary. I knew i didn’t “feel” like a man but couldn’t put words to it and i knew i wanted to dress femininely and i thought i just wanted to look more androgynous but with therapy and reflection and idk i did some lurking in trans and enby subreddits and thought i related more to enby subreddits at the time or that idk i had to but I realized the more time passed that i internally needed/wanted to medically transition and i felt *wrong* [binary thinking again] identifying as both nonbinary, transfemme and woman, but i realize especially now, having not only explored reddit, but through reading trans and nonbinary related books, documentaries and reconnecting with small group of real life allies Gender is expansive, fluid, a spectrum and it can be and is whatever you feel and shouldn’t be limited. So idk define yourself however you feel imo. I am Niimo and I’m a nonbinary, transfeminine woman, and it may seem counterintuitive to other people but they don’t get to tell me who I am. Only I define who I am. Sorry about the word vomit. I hope somewhere in my babbling, I made sense. My adhd brain can make me odd and confusing lol and i often stress over my communication even over online interactions
I lived a very sheltered life growing up, not in that my family kept me away from trans people, but rather they just raised me with a “we’ll always love you no matter how you identify” attitude. I didn’t even know what being transgender was until around college, during which time I met a few trans people there and I started opening my eyes to the possibilities in the world. Up until then, my image of a trans person was basically a drag queen, which I didn’t particularly identify with. However, growing up my whole life fantasizing about being a girl and having different “parts” made me realize I wasn’t cis, so that led to the Great Questioning (TM) I went through I college.

After meeting a variety of people I started realizing things were less rigid than I thought. I didn’t think I fit the definition of trans though, because I at the time didn’t think I had a problem being referred to as a boy (I couldn’t really identify dysphoria at the time). Long story short, after lots of exploration I settled for enby, but kept he/they pronouns. It stayed that way until I had a dream about being a girl, which was my Second Awakening (TM) and I wanted to start using they/them and changed what I wanted people to call me by name. Even so, I still didn’t identify as trans because I felt my identity didn’t fit the image I still had in my head of trans people being drag queens and very flamboyant. I was simply enby. 

The next major change was when I joined an online community composed of many trans people of all different backgrounds and came in all shapes and sizes. In this community I went by any/all pronouns (my avatar looked feminine but I was afraid my masculine voice would lead to confusion). Then someone referred to me as she/her and that was the final crack of my eggshell. I accepted being trans, but still am enby too. I realized both labels fit me, and I could happily be who I was, since I finally broke away that rigid image of what a trans woman is supposed to be like. 

The TL;DR of my journey is this: I knew I wasn’t cis but I had a very rigid image of what being trans was (and didn’t even know what trans even was until college due to a sheltered growing up), so when I started questioning I settled for enby but not trans. Eventually though I realized my true self and accepted that I was both trans and enby thanks to a community I joined changing my views on what it means to be trans and my first time experiencing genuine euphoria.
I understand that nonbinary is under the trans umbrella, but I don't feel comfortable calling myself trans. This has nothing to do with internalized transphobia or anything, but more of what I am comfortable caling myself. Its more that I feel I cannot connect to being trans because there was no ""transition"" in my discovery of my gender. There have been no changes to me, no transition, mostly a removal of something. I understand that trans people can remain the way they were born and still be trans, but it doesn't fit me because I did not feel I was born the wrong sex, I just felt like something needed to be taken away. If that makes sense. This is the best way I can explain it, I hope this doesn't come off wrong.
for me trans is about transitioning, not about my gender. being non-binary doesn't necessarily mean i've transitioned. i'm personally not comfortable with the idea that trans = not cis. i think a different word is needed
I just think that the never ending 'sorting chart' about gender is something that works pretty much like anything in life - some need it, some don't. I personally don't feel like I need any of it at all. It goes beyond me feeling like a man or a woman, neither or both. I just _don't care about feeling like a mar or a woman, neither or both_.

I guess the beauty of this is that you live it your way. Through the years I've learned how useless gender is in pretty much every single interaction I have with anyone at all. To me the issue lies where people reject or fear what they don't understand.

There's plenty of binary trans people that don't understand non-binary identities. That can make, in their understanding, even offensive that someone nb would say they're trans.

There's also this huge misconception where people believe trans means you _want to be something_, not that you _are_. That's a big leap and requires a lot of 'braining'.

I do feel like a trans person. And it's very real - I sometimes look at pictures of me before realising I was nb, before the process... and I'm just not there. That person in the picture isn't me. I look at him in the eyes and I'm pretty much like 'I don't know you, and I think I never really did'. I can't recognise myself there. I feel like I was born again. I guess that's the 'trans' feeling... for me. Maybe other nb people don't experience this, therefore they're not trans. That is something that would make sense to me.

This experience is so individual in a lot of ways that maybe we should just stand beyond language and assume that, when we're speaking about this, we are the only person we can apply our own definitions. Sounds complicated in a way, and liberating in another.
as someone who only realized I was non binary a year ago I never really questioned whether I was trans or not. I very much don't identify with the binary gender I was assigned at birth so therefore I'm trans.
I've always been a ""tomboy"".
I've always hated that word. 

I learned about the ID non-binary in my late 20s and hesitated initially to claim it because I'm okay with people just using my cis pronouns. 

Now that I've lived with the label a few years, I love it. I tell people I do not care what pronoun they wish to use with me, as I just generally dislike gendered anything. Apathy towards gender is a great way to put it. 

I wasn't sure if NB was considered trans or not, tbh. I would not say that I am not trans if someone tells me NB are trans. 🤷  But I also do not want to step on the toes of those who struggle more for the label? Like, maybe because I'm okay with cis pronouns, I'm not uncomfortable enough with being seen as cis to claim the label trans? I don't know. 

Honestly, all this gender talk feels like a waste of time. We should just all not care about gender. lol No one can take NB away from me tho. I live there now and I'm never leaving.
Intersex individuals are where the blanket statement about enbies being trans breaks down. It is because of these specific cases that we can say with confidence not to assume this, although there are plenty of other nuanced reasons not to assume someone is trans just because they're an enby.
As a non-binary I personally avoid the trans label with folks that are not in the know bc they automatically assume that my goal is to get all the surgeries and pass. The mainstream idea that once u say you’re trans you must start wearing pencil skirts and have long hair and frilly blouses is rlly bothersome to me.
I am nonbinary and I see myself as trans as well, but, I used to hardcore refuse and I still feel uneasy about the transgender label. The only reason is the opposite of your worries, impostor syndrome. I feel like I'm not good enough and not trans enough. I still paint my nails, wear skirts, have long hair, and am not dysphoric about my voice. But, I have always had a deep hatred of the idea of pregnancy and tried to make myself infertile in elementary school (I want kids, but, h*** no lol), I hate my.... uh chest. Even the word boobs sounds disgusting to me (only when it's about me though lol), I hate gendered pronouns ONLY neutral etc. I even have been approved for a hysterectomy and I feel like a kid going to Disney World about it, but, still, I feel not trans enough, because, I dress like a woman. Though I know that's bullsh*t now, that's just my insecurities talking. I mean I only wear long skirts and long hair, because, I just weirdly adore how they feel when they blow in the wind. I Like Breezy Clothes = Fake Trans it's just stupid unrealistic logic. I just have to tell myself that it's my inner artist being overly critical again.
I identify as NB but also trans. I have had top surgery and I do take hormones in small doses which has helped me achieve a more androgynous tone. My contribution to the conversation is that while seeking hormone therapy, it can be difficult for NB people because you are still being seen in a binary light. The doctors will want you to fully transition and I've had to actively advocate for lower doses. This experience made it harder for me personally to accept my trans identity for awhile.
>With that in mind, I never understood why a non-binary person wouldn't want to identify as trans.

The same reason I don't refer to myself as a Cancer Survivor after having a small bit of melanoma cut out of my arm. Technically true, but I bear none of the effort, trauma, grief, loss, or identity as those who labored through treatment after treatment. I didn't survive, I just kept doing everything as normal with the exception of two appointments.

My trans-ness (technically true) is barely noticeable even to me. So it doesn't make up any part of how I identity.
Cisco or Trans  very much feels like another binary that I don't want to engage in. I also don't know why the person who previously asked about this is being down voted.
Trans is a describing word. If you dont identify with whats in your pants from birth then trans is the appropriate describing word. You dont have to use the adjective for yourself, doesnt mean that its no less an adjective that can be used for you. I think very much like pronouns, you should and can be allowed to say those words make you uncomfortable and that you have better words for yourself, but unlike pronouns you cant change the fact that it still describes you.
For me, it feels like another binary (and maybe that’s ok). But functionally, if you tell someone you’re trans, (unless they are well educated about transness) they assume you want to align with the opposite gender, and apply the binary to you all over again. 

Do I understand and accept that I am a trans person? Yes. But I think my hesitation comes from genuinely feeling like neither gender, and only using “non-binary” gets me the closest to being perceived the way I want to be perceived. Not because of *transness itself* but because of how everyone else perceives transness and how their assumptions impact me. 

For folks that know me well, I use the label and they understand it. For folks I don’t know well, sometimes the additional work of explaining, correcting, educating etc, is too much, and I don’t always have the bandwidth for that. 

Is this a good take? I don’t know, but it’s an honest one.
I’m nonbinary but I don’t (at least currently) identify as trans because of the connotations of having a lot of dysphoria, wanting HRT, changing one’s name, and just overall having a bigger gender disconnect and wanting a bigger magnitude of transition than I want. Another big component is that I’m lesbian and identify with that label and I feel like if I said I’m trans and lesbian, that would make me seem like I’m AMAB, and there’s nothing wrong with that but that’s not who I am.

I used to identify as demigirl and identified even less with the trans label then because I still partially identified with my AGAB, didn’t identify with most trans experiences, and knew saying I’m trans would make it seem like I’d transitioned further than just from female to female-adjacent.

I’m open and interested to hear others’ thoughts on this, though!!
Personally i straight up didn’t know I was part of the trans umbrella in the beginning, because i had associated it with ftm or mtf. Once that was cleared up i can’t see it other way though. 

Non-Binary people are, by definition, trans. And saying you are not is like a cis person saying that they don’t “don’t feel cis” or “aren’t cis, just normal”. Most people would respond saying cis people should accept that cis is merely a descriptor and a definition for their non-transness. I think it’s only fair for enbies to accept that trans is a descriptor in the same way.

Hope my wording makes sense. I also don’t mind getting another perspective on this though

Edit: I forgot that gender non-conforming is a term too. I retract my statement and would say that enbies do not in fact need to accept trans as a label. I’ve seen some good arguments in the comments too
For me everything that is not cis, is trans. This includes all types of NB and intersex people. Now, this is how I see it, no attack on anyone. Also, I’m a binary FtM, but sometimes I realize that even though I feel and identify as binary, in an objective scientific analysis I might result being labeled NB. Fine. But this does not instantly make me not-trans, I would still be trans. And proud and happy to be so!
I'm not trans because I'm not transitioning to anything. I am me, and have always been this way regardless of how other people perceive me.

I cannot control other people putting labels on me, but I don't need to accept them.
I wonder if a lot of it comes down to the fact that when people hear trans, they don’t think of nonbinary people (including nonbinary people themselves), they just think MtF or FtM people (or more commonly stereotypes of these people), so there might be an element of not wanting anyone to assume anything about you. I don’t think the apprehension comes from transphobic values within the nonbinary community, I think it comes from a fear of being labelled and shoved around by the cishet hegemony XD.
I am a person who identifies as nonbinary but not as trans simply because I don’t feel I ever transitioned from one state of being to another. I’m comfortable with my sex assigned at birth and do not view myself in alignment with either side the currently available gender binary. Thus, I am nonbinary and have always been since I can remember being told “these are for boys” and “these are for girls” and fundamentally disagreeing with those boundaries. I do vehemently support the importance of the gender binary options as I know they bring joy and validation to many trans and cis people and that is wonderful. Simultaneously, my existence also contributes to an expansion of the binary to include other options, such as nonbinary or whatever cool specific label we will come up with in the future.
I identify as non binary spectrum as a demifemme but trans doesn't seem to fit me. Cis means same and trans means opposite, so cis gender is the same gender and sex, trans would be different gender as sex. I don't feel different, I don't feel the same either. I just feel like the gender machine ran out before it got to me.

Edited for wording choice. I want to note I don't have a problem being called trans, it just isn't something I call myself.
I actually felt like being trans meant you needed, not wanted, to change some aspect of yourself to fit the gender you didn't already display. However I also wasn't aware that some enbys changed their name. I am still learning.
i've never personally actually met any nonbinary people who didn't ID as trans, and a lot of the time the people 'fighting' for them to be completely separate labels aren't even nonbinary. so much so that most of the time when i hear someone say 'enby isn't trans' i just assume they're truscum until proven otherwise
I’ll add that saying a non-binary person must identify as transgender kinda feels like putting non-binary people in a gender box when we also may specifically identify as non-binary to get away from that
Being nonbinary is objectively being trans. If you don’t identify with your assigned gender, AKA if you aren’t cisgender, you are trans.
I think it’s possible to be both cis and non-binary. For instance an AMAB person who uses he/they pronouns. Some people in that category still identify with their gender at birth to a degree. But I’m they/them and I consider myself both trans and non-binary.
You make a lot of good points personally I think it comes from a perspective of lack of experience/information and assumptions based on that limited knowledge. I’m getting more comfortable using trans to describe myself but even though I’m in recovery for top surgery it doesn’t feel like *me* per se more a description of what I’m experiencing than who I *am*. I *AM* non-binary that’s the state in which I exist but I am transition*ing* so my outside looks more like how the inside always has I’m also gender-fluid so that’s always been fluctuating for me and it’s really hard to explain that so saying I’m transgender really confuses people because they assume I’m a man/woman just as much as they do prior to me saying anything. So yes I’m transgender but no I don’t identify myself that way it’s merely a description of what’s happening.
I think you’re spending a lot of time thinking/writing about something that is none of ur business. I get you’re just trying to have a conversation and to me you do not come off as rude or aggressive. However, the very conversation is the issue. You should (IMO) have zero feelings or thoughts or musings on what someone else says is true for them in regards to gender, sexuality, identity, and the like. You’re trans non-binary twinkledoo tinker bell? Great. I have no opinion. Moving on. By engaging in this conversation you’re creating conditions for box-making and gatekeeping. The very premise of the conversation is flawed regardless of the arguments stated within.
I'm in a weird place because I do think NB falls under trans (trans to me is just difference in your gender vs the one you were assigned, which I def feel) and I do suffer from dysphoria. 

At the same time I don't see any point in going through a break-up with my family (which would be necessary, I'd want to go into HRT and past a certain point there's no hiding it) and the political threats at the moment are so intense that I end up looking completely ""like my AGAB"" (of course those concepts are unnecessary, but I'm trying to be practical) because it's easier, while it seems the harder I try to match my inside, the worse I look. 

Point is I was AMAB, I've been perceived as a girl and people have had trouble gendering me like once or twice in my life (happy moments), I've gotten the weird online sexual harassment a bunch, I've gotten dirty looks and been laughed at for stuff like painting my nails, but factually I never go through what a lot of trans people do because I'm not doing anything to permanently make me look not cis, whatever that would be. The fact that I'm already 26 and didn't realize it until like 22 because of familial repression also makes me bitter at this point, and I don't know how much of my terrible mental health is related to dysphoria, but I'm so emotionally exhausted that it seems almost too much work trying to figure that out. At the end of the day I feel like an ally because I'm not going to speak about the trans experience looking and living like this. I can talk about my dysphoria and people's aversion to GNC individuals, I can speak on homophobia since I'm perceived as a man and am into men, but it ends there. 


It also feels like I might be inventing it, because if I have so much dysphoria how can I stand all these years?

I should say this is how I feel personally, I'd *never* tell someone else what they should call themselves. So I'm transfem (at least on the inside) and definitely NB, but I'd feel absolutely uncomfortable going around trying to speak ""as a trans person"" when we might be on the verge of trans genocide. I avoid thinking too hard about it lest I end up in a crisis for weeks. I'm probably not the best person to answer this because I do consider myself trans, I just don't say it because I've seen some of the harassment binary trans friends go through and I *really* have no place talking about it as the victim. I have a very complicated relationship with gender id and NB as a label is vague enough that I can use it without thinking of said relationship. On the other hand, when a random cishet hears ""trans"" they'll think binary trans woman, and I don't want to contribute to certain stereotypes because I am not qualified to speak as a trans girl, but this has more to do with outside misconceptions of trans id. Oh well, such is life and sorry for the rant mess.
I am nonbinary and trans because I am getting rid of my top I hate it but people don't have to be trans to be nonbinary
A good article about this topic https://www.intomore.com/you/trans-enough-trans/
I'm transgender and nonbinary. I don't identify with the gender I got assigned at birth. I never thought of myself as a boy or a man. I thought of myself as a human first. To me I'm transgender nonbinary, but I know of a nonbinary person who don't think theirself as trans. They're valid like I'm valid.
i don’t like identifying as trans. most people think MTF or FTM when they hear trans. i don’t want people to think i’m binary.
I recently encountered the idea that the suffix 'trans' doesn't necessarily have to mean 'transitioning.' That sometimes the trans suffix - which I wholeheartedly own, as someone who is both a genderqueer goblin, but also an mtf transgender person - can represent 'transgressive', as in violating moral or social boundaries.

&#x200B;

Let's be honest, for a lot of societies out there being queer is a crime. Loving/being in the way we do has a history associated with violence and oppression. And no, being queer or gay or however you identify in this community does not make you a bad person. Yet, understandably most folks would prefer to just vibe and be allowed to exist without the threat of violence or intergenerational trauma being passed down from elder gays to young queers.

&#x200B;

However, I would argue that this transgression from society, and maybe even more so the transgression against society is deeply entrenched in our moral, ethical fiber as queer people. Bell Hooks, says something to the effect that while being queer can have the elements of loving or being, queerness is about the self that is at odds with everything around it and has to *invent* and *create* in such a way until we can eventually thrive and live. And to that point, as we uncouple, disengage and dismantle oppression through loving ourselves and our fellow queers as we start to perceive our being-in-the-world as not tied to phenotypical preconceived notions of who we should be; we create better worlds for us and those who come later. And what is more trans than inventing and creating the person you always should have been? What is more transgressive than thriving and living in a world that is not designed for many of us. 

&#x200B;

That is not to say that all non-binary people are trans, or should necessarily identify as trans. But if they aren't, I would pose the question ""How are you creating space to be yourself in the world?"" Because you deserve to create the space you need to thrive and to live. And for me, part of that is owning up to my legacy as a bad ass bitch who takes no shit from no one.
Droppin my two bits in.  


NB, not trans. I fall under the ""gender fluid"" category. Sometimes I lean more masculine. Sometimes I lean feminine. My ""dysphoria"" is rare. I'm not exactly turnin heads everywhere I go, but I clean up nice and get a few compliments now and then. Depending on where I am on the gender spectrum, I may even play into it just for the fun of it. The moments I don't like my body are more of a general dissatisfaction than an outright hate/repulsion- ""I don't like this jiggly bit here, or that acne scar there, and if I could be about five inches taller, that'd be great.""  


To me, trans just doesn't fit. Trans is something not your birth gender, but I'm in this grey area where I am and am not at the same time. I was born female. I present female. I spend most of my time as female and I've got all the lady bits. But on a mental level, I lean heavily towards masculine most of the time. I hang out with the guys and shoot the shit and if a pretty little doe-eyed thing looks my way, I'm not above some playful flirting. What makes this different from ""just a Tomboy"" (which is what most folks think I am IRL) is that this extends into ""adult activities"". I'm fortunate enough to be genetically predisposed towards very dense musculature. My partner (AMAB) is also genderfluid, but leans feminine. They're a full six inches taller and all around physically bigger than me, but I can pick them up and carry them around the house with little difficulty. I make them *feel* small and weak (which is exactly what they want most of the time). I prefer to be on the ""giving"" side of things, rather than ""receiving"".

*Most* of the time.

And it's this little distinction that makes being labeled as ""transgender"" feel like a lie. Even if I *usually* lean masculine, I *do* still have feminine tendencies as well. I will sway back and forth between the two on a regular basis, sometimes more than once in the same hour. I see plenty of non-binary genderfluid folks post pictures of themselves dressed both ways (masc and femme) and their ability to seamlessly switch between the two is absolutely astounding to me. Genuinely makes me envious, since I tend to look much younger than I am and my few attempts to go ""masculine"" just leave me looking like some little cholo (think hispanic wanna-be ""thug"" looking kid and you get the idea, lmao).  


=====

TLDR; The trans label doesn't fit me because I'm gender fluid and my gender alignment does sometimes coincide with my birth gender.
I 100% agree and we needed to have this discussion. Well worded, I wouldn't have had the energy for this right now.
Similar to what several others have already said, I do personally identify as trans (as well as nonbinary and genderfluid) but I feel awkward outwardly saying so. I worry binary trans folks will see me as appropriating something from them when they have markedly different struggles than my own (seeing as the general public so often still sees me as my agab). I think this is also why I'm nervous to even expand my pronouns publicly from they/she to they/she/he.  
And like, I should add, I would advocate for anyone else in my situation to do whatever tf they want. I know it's at least partly imposter syndrome, but the feeling is still there
I outed my questioning to a trans woman, she helped me figure this shit out, and so when she calls me trans as well, I accept it graciously haha. I get this fear of course, but I try not to let it get me down. Everyone should identify how they like, and being enby shouldn't bar or forcibly preclude you also being trans. My trans momma thinks I'm trans, and honestly I'm still not sure if the label applies to me, but for now, that's enough for me.
It took me quite a while to come around to being apart of the trans blanket. I didn’t “feel trans”, whatever that’s supposed to mean. Eventually, I was able to really look at that thought and ask the very question: what does that statement mean? 

So, I myself am not a trans person. I’m nonbinary. My gender identity falls under the trans flag though, so I get invited to all the parties.
I think its complicated but at the end of the day imo (and imo solely and truly) that enby falls under trans because your transition isn't defined by how hard you go in the other direction but more so fitting into a body that's yours.
I agree with you 100%. Nonbinary is a trans identity. We are trans because our gender identity doesn’t match our birth assigned gender & sex. We are not cis so we are trans.

The only arguments I see against it are imposter syndrome and internalised transphobia, which… isn’t good.
NB is represented by the white stripe on the trans flag, so....there it is, lol.
I def think it comes from a place of ignorance; i.e. a common misconception I find is that people think you need to transition to be trans. You don't. All that's needed is for you to not identify with the birth gender you were given. You do not need to take hormones to be trans!

Likewise, for anyone who needs to hear this:

#You can still want to take hormones or transition while still being non-binary!

I'm recovering from my second trans fem surgery and I've been on feminizing hormones for nearly 5 years now and I'm non-binary. My gender is separated from the way I want my body to look and function.
I'm not a 100% sure about this. I don't identify  with the gender I was assigned  at birth but I'd rather be called nonbinary then trans. Yes, I get that it's a blanket term for people but not everyone is comfortable with it. I'm not all caught up with everything happening in the community's but I think my opinion is just important.  My main point it just that not everyone may be comfortable using a blanket term weather or not it is one. Like a gender fluid person may not be comfortable with using the term trans even though they might be under that blanket. They may just prefer being called gender fluid, and I don't really see anything wrong with that. I do see your concern but I also think it's okay that people may not want to use the term.
The main reason I don't describe myself as trans--at least not around cis people--is a matter of semantics. What it means to be ""trans"" has a much narrower definition in cis spaces--that you have somehow taken steps to transition medically or socially. And aside from adding they/them alongside he/him pronouns, I...havent. I look pretty much the same as I did before I realized I was nonbinary, I haven't changed my name, I move through the world as if I were cis. And so I don't describe myself as trans with cis people in large part because I don't want to give the,the wrong idea. 

Now, when I'm around other trans/nonbinary/genderqueer people? Whole different story, because they ""get"" it. 

But I think there's a case to be made for being more vocal about claiming our trans identity in cis space in order to reinforce the understanding that there are countless ways to be trans.
i feel like i’m trans because identifying as nonbinary for 4 years now i’m so far removed from female identity and womanhood that moving back to that WOULD feel like transitioning to me, i wouldn’t find it a detransition. i feel like i’m trans wherever i land on the spectrum.
intersex people are also NB. generally intersex complicates it a lot. I've heard of intersex people being assigned *different genders* by their doctors and their parents. it doesn't make much sense to tie being NB to something that relies on having to change other's perception of your body to be recognized as who you are when if you're NB and intersex, people disagree on whether there's anything to transition *to.*
I'm 33 and only this last year or 2 have come to identity as non binary or simply gender apathetic. I've anyways been what I'd call cis passing and so I've never faced persecution or discrimination based on being trans, for being a ""weirdo"" or a ""freak"" plenty but not for being trans. This all makes me feel guilty about including myself in a marginalized group when I'm immune for the most part from the worst aspects of being trans. I've never changed my name nor have I asked for pronouns other than agab (if someone is nice enough to ask, I'll tell them any work). I want to make it clear it is my own imposter syndrome making me feel this way and I know that in reality I am welcome and my experience and journey are valid. 

In the end, I consider myself trans because I've transitioned from identifying as male to no longer identifying with either gender completely. 

I also feel gatekeepers suck in general and the more diverse a group is, the stronger it is. There are real rights to fight for in the LGBTQ+ community and we do that by standing together.
There are only two genders. Cis or trans. lol

>> So you are either a cis person or a trans person.
I get that being a gender other than the one you were assigned at birth technically means being trans, but personally, I don't say that I'm trans because:

1) I have come out to exactly one person and it was through a meme

2) I think a lot of people who aren't as well-versed in LGBT+ terminology may assume that trans in that context would mean the opposite gender from the one assigned at birth rather than a different one

3) I don't wanna take attention away from people who identify with the ""traditional"" definition of trans, because they absolutely deserve the respect
I'm going to write this as my opinion only, as someone who identifies as non-binary but not transgender. The reason I'm careful to say it's only my opinion is because I don't want to discredit any other perspectives - and because I haven't bothered to engage with much of the discourse around this topic so I have no idea if my views align with any theory or dogma around trans/non-binary topics. 

So. That being said.

There are a few reasons why I wouldn't consider non-binary identity to fit cleanly under the umbrella of trans identity. The first reason is simply that I see non-binary identity as being much broader category than trans identity, while trans identity is much more *specific* than non-binary identities. If that sounds like I'm essentializing trans identity I apologize, but what I mean is that trans identity typically has a *target*. Which is to say that a transman has a specific ideal of presentation. *Towards* man. *Away* from woman. Or for a transwoman, the same ideal but in the opposite direction. Towards woman, away from man. My non-binary experience is that I'm comfortable with all expressions - I'm not towards or away from anything; my gender expression doesn't have a 'preferred' state.

This leads into the second reason why I consider trans and non-binary expression to be separate categories: 'trans' does not mean 'non-conforming', and acting as if the terms are synonymous emphasizes AGAB in a way that I think can be harmful. We know gender has very little do with sex, except that sex is the organizational principle for gender expression. As a non-binary person, I would challenge this principle, and say that my AGAB has (or should have) little to do with my gender expression. I don't think this makes me transgender, though, because *I do not care about my AGAB*. I'm perfectly comfortable identifying as a girl, or as a boy, or along or outside of the spectrum - but it doesn't matter whether I was AMAB or AFAB, *that has no bearing on my gender expression*. To a trans person it might matter, because of dysphoria or other AGAB-related trauma. Their movement is *across* gender, *trans* gender, towards a more comfortable form of expression; whereas I'd characterize my relationship to gender as something more fluid, moving *through* gender. I'm not sure how much sense that makes. But I think there is a difference.

The last reason is just that I simply don't relate to many aspects of the trans experience. I've had trans friends, and heard them talk about dysphoria. I've read the statistics and seen the trauma that transgender people have to live through on a near-daily basis. I feel privileged not to deal with those problems: I've only ever been euphoric, never dysphoric in my relationship to my body. So when I answer the question by saying, ""I don't feel like a trans person,"" it isn't because I'm trying to essentialize the trans experience to some archetype of transgenderness, it's because I know that claiming trans identity would give people the wrong idea of what I've gone through: and if gender is a social interface, then the 'trans' label simply doesn't communicate what I want other people to know about me.
I personally don't identify as trans, despite being nonbinary, because I'm agender, and for me personally, saying that I'm trans (changing/different gender) when I have no gender feels like I'm invalidating myself. The trans label (to me) refers to something that I don't have (gender), so it doesn't make sense imo, it's like dividing by zero. I have nothing against any agender peeps who do feel like trans fits them, though! Honestly kinda wish it weren't the case for me, because the trans flag is way more my aesthetic than the nonbinary or agender ones.
I strongly dislike any labels for myself that emphasize the direction my gender came from or is going, and for me the ""trans"" label comes with the added baggage of often being subcategorized into ""transfem"" and ""transmasc."" Neither of these terms feel good for me. This may just be my bias, but I feel far more free from the binary when the only descriptor I use for myself is one describing the absence of something (non-binary = not binary) rather than explicitly describing the relationship my gender has to my birth gender. The fact that I ""used to be"" something else just isn't something I want appearing in my labels, even if its true.
For a long time I had no idea non-binary fell under the trans umbrella. I thought it was its own separate thing. 

&#x200B;

I also personally feel that trans as an identity is more definitive than whatever I've got going on. Not to mention the vast majority of folks I'd have the opportunity to converse with would probably just get confused.

&#x200B;

But honestly, I've questioned being trans a lot in my life. As a child I would occasionally tell my mother I wanted to be a boy. So who knows? Maybe it's something I should look into more and work through my own silly hangups.
Hello, i consider myself nonbinary and transitioning (ftm). I do indeed take hrt and have been for almost 3 years. I still consider myself nonbinary. The issue i run into with all of this, is people will force a certain view onto others. So when i tell people I'm XYZ they scold me for ""mixing up the two"" or ""it's one or the other."" As in you can't transitions and be nonbinary at the same time. I'll admit it confuses me why one can't be both, why can't i be more comfortable in my body and still be nonbinary? It's all fine and dandy if your one or the other but we can be more then just one thing. I have also noticed people are very binary in there thinking even when it comes to being nonbinary which defeats the whole aspect of it all. Idk my main thing is people like to force a certain narrative because they want control of some sort or be little others (at least in my experience!!!)
From what I have heard, trans means you aren’t cis. Being cis gender means your gender aligns with your sex. As a result, non-binary would fit in this definition as their sex and gender are not the same.
For me personally, i have no issue with being referred to under the umbrella term of trans. However i don't think my NB experience is representative of a trans person's experience. I have many trans friends and while there is a lot we have in common and some of them also identify as NB, when trans topics come up i don't feel like it's my place to include myself and my story. I often get concerned that referring to me as trans is taking up space for ""real"" trans people who already gave so much marginalisation and erasure.
I'm trans, but sometimes forget that, I just am a person. I see my medical transition essentially as body mods, I am currently on T and had top surgery so I like my body more now.

I would be just as trans or neutral without that. I  hate gatekeeping the term, you could blend in with your agab (name, pronouns, hair, body, clothes etc.) but still be trans! I define trans very broadly, just not identifying as your agab is enough.
I do kind of love the irony of the binary “you are either cis or you’re trans” but yeah I identify as trans nonbinary so 🤷🏻
To tired enough to contribute anything valid, but I myself identify as tranfem enby. Also thansk for starting an importatnt discussion OP <3
I went from a transwoman to nonbinary, so being called trans by friends feels like they just haven't understood the changes in my understanding of self I've gone through. Its similar to when people use she/her in public rather than they/them, though I do still look fem so it's more understandable when people are talking about me to strangers.
""Trans"" as a label doesn't matter to me that much, but I know that the label matters alot to other people, so it doesn't really feel like my place to weigh in on who should be allowed to use it, even if it does apply to me.
In my life i have met exactly 1 (one) (just one) nonbinary person who didn’t also identify as trans, and yet just about every binary trans person I’ve ever met has either straight up misgendered me or asked me if I “identify as trans”, so sometimes i feel like people use the statement “some nonbinary people don’t ID as trans” as an excuse to very carefully and delicately exclude nonbinary people from trans places or force us to prove we belong. And for that reason, I fucking hate it
I am trans masculine (“passing”, on T since 2015, post op top surgery) and also identify more as non-binary than male. I find that we can use the words most accurately to describe ourselves and two similar people might not use he same words to describe themselves. I try not to see words as boxes and more of tools for people to articulate their experiences and find people with shared experiences for a sense of community. I think people should just identify how they want and understand not everyone feels the same way about the same words in the same context.
I feel like trans just says you’ve changed from your birth sex in some form and non-binary is what you transition to. Technically someone can have a non-binary social transition and they can definitely have a non-binary medical transition. I can see how someone who isn’t transitioning medically might not like the trans label and I don’t usually like using the term too much myself but in general trans just mean you required some sort of transition to get from your birth gender.
I'm an Agender Non-binary I don't really identify with trans because I don't really feel the need to If some enbys identity with trans that's great nothing against it just what I choose to identify with isn't really trans in my personal Identity. Saying that I'm transgender personally is a bit offensive because I don't identify with any gender to me I'm genderless.
You're speaking my mind.
When I recently came out two year ago as non binary I didn't feel I fitted the trans criteria to consider myself trans; a kind person on Twitter explained me that transition doesn't imply hormones or something like that.

Now I have come into terms with my gender, and I do consider myself trans however I keep a low profile outside the internet safe spaces
First of all, I’d like to say that I’m non-binary and I identify as trans. My gender does not match the gender I was given at birth, therefore I’m trans. But there is a caveat here. I never introduce myself or tell someone I’m trans before telling them I’m non-binary. The reason behind this is that some people (a big percentage in my conservative town) think of “trans” as MtF or FtM. So if I say I’m trans, they’ll think I’m that type, not non-binary. 

Also I like the points being made about the different types of gender identity and why they might be uncomfortable with using trans as a term for themselves. Personally, I don’t have a gender identity beyond “non-binary”. I focused on labeling my gender and sexuality for about a year. I tried to find the perfect label for myself. But I realized that it was a waste of my time because every time I settled on a label, something else came up that changed my perspective on things. I felt like I was putting myself in a box, which isn’t fair to myself. So now I’m just gonna ride the wave and see what happens. I might try and define the feelings I have, but I’ve come out as 3 things now and I’m done with that shit. 

I wanna clarify though that i mean no disrespect towards anyone who wants to find a good label or anyone who has a specific label to their gender. It’s just not for me.
Agree with all that you've said. Same with my experiences of non-binary people online not liking the term trans.

I've come across multiple men and women offline, who weren't assumed that gender at birth, but who don't identify as trans. Yet we still, generally, say trans men and women. I actually find that when people don't want non-binary people to be included by default in the term 'trans', it tends to come from enbyphobia. And it has an impact. Seeking trans healthcare or trans processes gatekept by cis people is made harder when non-binary is portrayed as sorta trans and sorta not

Personally, I almost kinda call myself trans rather than non-binary out of the two, because when I was realising my gender, non-binary wasn't so established as the default umbrella term for those who aren't male nor female
First, let's start with the definition of ""binary"": relating to, composed of, or involving two things.

I'm nonbinary, used to identify as transgender (before there was such a term as nonbinary). I see the 2 as totally separate things. To be trans is to identify with the gender that is out of sync with the body parts, and as such is very much binary, you are either male or female. Whereas nonbinary means that you don't identify with either gender, or both, and as such is not binary. 

To me it is impossible to be trans and nonbinary at the same time, since the two are mutually exclusive. For a transgender person, they want to be the gender that does not align with what was assigned at birth. This does not mean that they necessarily want to transition, but at the same time, the gender they were assigned is not who they are. On the other side, being nonbinary means that you can identify with both genders, or neither gender, for some of us this is a fluctuating thing, as it is for me. Some days, I identify as male, other days female, other days neither. Most of the time I walk the fence, mixing and matching as my mood determines is best for that moment.

Where I see the relationship between the two is that for many of us, we will migrate from transgender to nonbinary, or the other way, possibly multiple times within our lives. Since both sit outside the traditional gender roles defined by society, there can be much confusion between the two, especially by those who are very ""binary"". For the binary folks, they see us as the same thing, but we are not. Trans and nonbinary are about as similar as male and female are.
This thread has been really interesting to me!! I first want to say thank you to OP for starting this discussion. All the different perspectives are incredibly valuable, so I also want to thank everyone who’s participated—your words have helped me more than you can know. Because it’s very important, I want to say now that I 100% respect everyone’s decision to identify only with the terms that make you comfortable and bring you joy. I think it would be pointless to force an unwanted identity on someone, as I’m sure most here can agree! 

Now to the meat of my answer. I’m neurodivergent so it can be hard for me to conceptualize outside black and white thinking and my brain unhelpfully tries to “logic” me out of identifying with anything on technicalities and is Very Very Scared about being wrong.  Reading the thoughts shared here, I’ve been able to “try on” different voices and see how the words and beliefs match up or don’t with my internal feelings. For a couple years now I’ve been silently yet incessantly chewing on the terms non-binary, agender, and transgender, knowing that I don’t feel like my AGAB but ???? anything more specific than that was fuzzy and hard to pin down because I wanted to be 100% sure with ZERO doubts whatsoever (not realistic). I’ve only spoken about gender stuff with my therapist, and it took SO much courage to even bring it up. Imposter syndrome is a hell of an experience. 

However, being able to read your words with my voice helped me realize I *do* fit into my personal definition of trans. This definition I use is absolutely not forced onto anyone else, and is just how I view myself—feel free to use it for yourself if you like it, but again, no one should adopt a label they don’t feel fits them! So, my definition of being transgender is: not identifying solely and completely with the gender assigned at birth. I’m agender so I don’t identify with my agab. When I imagine a doctor saying “It’s a AGAB!” about me and I would like to respond “No thanks, you can keep it!” I don’t want to be held to any expectations based on the genitals they saw or assumed, and I think making distinctions between “boy stuff” and “girl stuff” is unhelpful because they’re just clothes/toys/things and anyone is allowed to enjoy those things. I respectfully abstain from gender, because I don’t *feel* it. I don’t identify with my AGAB, so I am trans. I feel marginally more comfortable with “trans” than “transgender” but I don’t feel that it’s a meaningful distinction for me since removing the “gender” part of my other identity (agender) would just be…”a” and that’s confusing. Words are weird; the point of communication is trying to externally describe our internal beliefs and experiences to others, but it’s never going to be perfectly precise, and sometimes we just use the closest thing and that’s okay. After my reading I think this may be somewhat different than other agender people here, but I don’t feel like the term “agender” implies a gender because that’s what the “a” is for: “not”gender. Agender to me is “Gender? Nah.”

Another note—to me, being transgender does not necessarily imply transitionING as I’ve seen some say here. Everyone’s journey is different and physical transition isn’t always possible or wanted. Additionally, I never took Chemistry in school so I don’t have the same perception of “trans” meaning “across” in a very diametrically opposed way to “cis”. As a layman, I view it similarly to “across the road.” I am white so I can’t speak for other cultures, but “Western culture” largely assumes people will align with their AGAB—it’s the “default setting.” So for example, a person who always 100% feels like their AGAB would be standing in a field with others of the same AGAB. There is sense of community within this group, they are “on the same side,” they are cis. Someone who doesn’t identify solely and completely with their AGAB has a community “across the road” with others who have the same experience of not solely and completely feeling like their AGAB. A person whose gender is fluid or multiple is (ideally) welcomed in both groups because they are allowed to align with their AGAB, and the trans label is there for them as well because no matter how slight and no matter how hard imposter syndrome comes for them, they will likely have similar challenges if they choose to live openly and honestly as their identity. 

For those on the fence or struggling with imposter syndrome or those who align with the trans label, consider this. (And feel free to disregard this if it doesn’t resonate!) It can be incredibly dangerous to be visibly trans in the world these days. It’s scary that politicians are debating our humanity and trying to remove us from society, demonizing and invalidating and hurting us. I think it’s valid to be too scared to show your transness, but that doesn’t necessarily make you less trans or not trans. There is no such thing as being or not being “trans enough.” Being able to endure or deal with being referred to in a way you don’t feel is accurate is not living your best life. It’s like enduring any kind of abuse and can build up and cause trauma. Your physical safety should be your first concern, and if your environment is not safe, you can retreat to the safety of your mind where you can find solace in knowing who you are. No one knows you better than you. You can comfort yourself and find comfort with others who are like you. You deserve happiness. We all do. That’s why I think it’s important for the trans community to stand together and show that people who are “different” are deserving of respect, and that anyone who has a minuscule drop of “not *quite* my AGAB” in their identity is a part of that community. That’s the trans umbrella. We need to look out for each other. And those who don’t want to claim the trans label of course don’t have to, but I hope you’re an ally to the trans community. 💕

I’ve gone on too long already, but I have one more thing to add. I’m 30 and it’s taken me so long to come to any of this. In the early 2010s I spent a lot of time on tumblr and I had a tiny sparkle of gender questioning when I learned of non-binary identities. But the terrible opinions on tumblr convinced me there was no way I was trans and that anything other than binary trans man and binary trans woman was “fake” and “for attention” and “completely invalid” and I shoved everything deep down and locked it up. I am so sad that I internalized such clear transphobia and lost valuable time that I could have been living as my true self. They were wrong. They ARE wrong. No one is invalid in their identity—if it feels right to them and they want to claim it, it’s likely right and no one should argue because we can only know our internal perceptions and what others tell us about theirs. I trust that someone coming out to me is right about their identity. If they decide later they didn’t quite have it right, I trust that the new identity is the right one. The other identity wasn’t wrong per se, but perhaps just another step in their journey to finding and understanding themself, and that makes me happy for them! 

Thanks again to anyone who managed to get through this. I had more thoughts than I realized. Wish me luck in coming out irl! 💕
I've only just discovered I'm non-binary, and am still figuring out what fits for me and what doesn't.

It took me 31 years to heal enough from religion and abuse to realize - it's gonna take me more than a year to figure out who I am without those influences.

I think it does come down to self-determination, like much of being queer to me. While I could probably describe myself as transmasc pansexual, it truly doesn't feel as though it fits me. Perhaps it will in time, but for now in my journey, I know how I'm most comfortable identifying: non-binary bisexual.

While I do feel more masc than my gender expression typically suggests, I also don't feel my gender identity is ""strongly"" trans enough for me to use that as my own term. I have many trans friends, and there's a distinctive line for me between how I experience my gender identity and how they've described it to me.

To me, considering myself a non-binary person, and that's it, is the most accurate label. I don't know if I want top surgery, or if I want to microdose T, or if I want to just lose as much weight as I healthily can and bind/tape (so far my goal is the last one).

I feel if I get a surgery, I may refer to myself as transmasc - but at the same time, I don't know that I really would consider it that.

My body may have been born with certain parts, but my soul has always been non-binary. And that's what I identify with. My body is simply a physical form that I may need to adjust within possible limits. 

I think it's best to let people choose their labels, or choose to go without them.

We won't always understand, and that's ok. We just need to respect.
I agree with you. I’m trans in the same way I’m human. The trans layer is outside the NB layer in the Identity Onion, just as human is further outside than both, and life form is outside all of these.
I second the first point. I defiantly am non-binary but I tend to lean more femme in my appearance and just in general. It took me along time to feel comfortable saying that I’m enby because I still did identify somewhat with the gender I was assigned with. I though that I needed to be either more masc presenting or androgynous to be non-binary. I don’t feel comfortable calling myself trans though because I somewhat identify with my AGAB.
I'm point number 1 on this list. This is a very concise, inclusive and good argument, thanks, mate.
Thanks for all that.  I’m new in town and often joke the only thing I can confidently identify as is a mess.  Since I am at the beginning of self discovery if you will, I feel more comfortable claiming non-binary opposed to trans because I am not certain what I feel concretely enough to make a decision.  I do feel encouraged knowing now that it’s under the trans umbrella as that makes sense.  But currently  just saying to buck the whole system and not be confined to any binary choice.  If that makes sense.
To me, the label of trans is about solidarity more than anything else. Since easily the grand majority of peole completely identify with their AGAB, I think we should start defining trans as ""anyone who isn't completely cis"". This way we could support each other and demand legal rights and social acceptance more effectively as a coherent group. (The end goal of course being eventually making labels somewhat redundant.)
This is a fantastic write up, also I love your username. I really agree that for now it needs to come down to self determination. I think the things I would like to work on right now would be more acceptance of non-binary people in the mainstream trans communities, and more assurance for non-binary people that they are in fact welcome in those communities if they want to be there. I think that would help in those cases of internalized transphobia or confusion. When I first started figuring out my gender, it did take me a lot longer to identify with and use the trans label, because it almost felt like I had imposter syndrome about it.
Very good points in my opinion. I fall under the first point and want to add: That the fear of raising confusion if I say I'm trans sadly sometimes comes from fearing stumbling over a transphobe who thinks me calling myself trans means I'm ""a women with a dick"" or ""a men in a dress"" in their horrible view of humans and that it means getting attacked from them. I try to overcome this fear and when I feel bold enough I even use their transphobic assumption against them and to dodge bullets in dating by calling myself openly a trans non-binary demigirl. 

However I am a okay with being called both trans or cis if it's not in a harassing or patronizing way from queer and non-queer people.
thank you, that’s so articulate and nuanced and in point !

I’m non binary, I personally associate NB with transness, but because I lean on fem-passing for work, and I understand the confusion and subtlety of people associating “trans” with “transition”, I usually don’t really talk about transness much.
Thanks for the likes and awards!! I changed the formatting since listing them in numbered points looked like a cluster fuck and was difficult even for me to read after posting yskkxgdjkdg
Same here. Sure I’m non-binary and therefore trans but I def look like a ~cis~ person of my agab. So I don’t like to say I’m trans bc I feel like it’s kinda co-opting it??? But as an umbrella term I like it & think it makes sense
Second this but with my sister.
Reading this felt like reading my own thoughts :O Thanks for sharing your experience and writing it so well, I feel like I’ve just had a break through.
I don't think calling yourself trans would give anyone a way to attack us. I think that the more we are represented as regular people in other people's lives, the more people will accept us.
Trans people don’t have to do anything to transition or feel dysphoria.
This. I'm agender and am hesitant to call myself trans, because I don't make active effort to physically/socially transition and can pass as my AGAB when it suits me (even if that's not how I identify deep down). There is no particular gender that I want to ""transition"" into.
This is the most valid comment here. Can't believe this entire conversation trying to force a label onto a group of people who have already picked a label they are happy with. I feel devalued. I'm not trans. I'm nonbinary. So strange to see a whole conversation of people denying my label should exist who I considered on the same spectrum as me. Just because we share a spectrum doesn't mean there's only one valid label for us all.
Agender means they’re not on the binary or man or woman which is what being non binary is. So they’re allowed to call themselves that if they so choose
Honestly binary trans people are the ones speaking over us lamo
It’s okay if you can’t relate to the mindset of being binary trans, but don’t accuse binary trans people of playing to stereotypes or reinforcing patriarchy. There are good historical reasons why trans people play up their masculinity/femininity in public, because until very very recently we had to. Trans people could be kept out of necessary transition treatments if we didn’t present masc or fem enough. In some cases and with some providers this is still the case.

Additionally not all gender expressions are the same. An overly feminine trans woman may just naturally be inclined to femininity, which would not normally draw any scrutiny if she was cis, but because she is trans, ignorant people may label her as performative.

Look, transitioning is never a regressive act. It can’t reinforce patriarchy because heteronormativity is being destroyed, and because it empowers womanhood to embrace both femininity and female masculinity.
This!! This is a great explanation of how I feel too!!
I felt that way early on. But we are trans too! It's not disingenuous. Though it certainly helps to have a nuanced understanding & perspective.
You're not, is the point. Dysphoria is not needed to be transgender. And just because your experiences don't match those as a binary trans person doesn't mean they cannot be trans experiences. Binary trans people don't have a monopoly on the trans experience, and like... Trans women and trans men don't have the same trans experience, and that doesn't make one more real or trans than the other. There is more than one way to be trans, and you would not be appropriating the trans experience by having one that does not fit into binary categories. And having to tolerate being seen as your AGAB even though you don't like it is like... Literally a part of trans discrimination. It's not a privilege. I don't want to argue with you on what labels you use, only you can decide that, but I do want to be very clear that none of what you've said in any way disqualifies a person from being trans.
This though...  it feels like another binary that we are playing into. Don't know why you are getting down voted for that question
To this I would like to add that I think it’s good to talk about it. I sometimes think that enbies that don’t want to be called trans have some kind of internalized transfobia, o bad experience with the word “trans”. Hopefully I’m mostly wrong.

Anyway, the best thing is that everyone can just identify how they want and state what terms they like to be used.
Just a clarification that being trans has nothing to do with ""transitioning"". I appreciate your perspective though.
Hahaha.

""Open discussion"" by downvoting. Nice.
For the record, this is actually the first time I ever really thought about the fact that I’m technically trans by being nonbinary, and I’m really glad to have been prompted to think about this by this post so many thanks op! :3

I’m going to be using this flag a lot more from now on 🏳️‍⚧️❤️
trans doesn’t mean opposite
Just to clarify, trans doesn't mean opposite. Not trying to invalidate anything else you said though.
I would also like to add that yes nonbinary 100% belongs under the trans umbrella. At the end of the day just because your not taking hrt, doesn't mean you are transforming into the person you are! You are essentially ""erasing"" the gender role placed onto you and tada being you. Which is wonderful and so beautiful! So yes nonbinary does indeed go hand in hand with trans
Yeah!! It's understandable why you don't identify as trans, you're still nonbinary either way no matter how feminine you are or relate with your AGAB!
For myself I find it often depends on how I am relating to the world in the moment. Like the first time I considered be at least somewhat trans was when my so said I was ""white knighting"" for a community I wasn't a part of, all because one mutual trans of ours thought Dave Chappelle special was funny. He knew I was nonbinary but never considered how I would relate to trans people (and how trans people are not a monolith and our one friend doesn't always represent the whole community). I still feel weird considering myself 'fully' trans though. More like trans adjacent. Largely because I do present feminine mostly, except the occasional binder and my hair can be short boyish to shoulder length depending on how often I get a haircut. And I do care about women's problems because they still affect me, especially when I work labour jobs and can't be fully open about being nonbinary for safety and job security (would be illegal to fire me for it, but they might find a small reason or be shitty to me).
I'm AFAB and I lean more masculine. I hardly do anything feminine except recently dressing like more feminine. I do somewhat identify with my gender at birth just because I was born as a woman but had I been born as a man,I would just be ok. I do take the title of trans because I do feel like it fits but if I lean more on my female side then I feel fake and or lying. Idk it's weird
You're welcome!!
Right!! It's okay if you aren't totally sure right now, especially since you just started coming to terms with being nonbinary!! Even if the trans label never quite fits you down the line, that's still fine! Learning more about yourself and what feels right is what's most important in the end!
Ohh good idea!! I once saw a definition of trans being like ""someone who does not have the gender given to them at birth or has that gender, but still feels incomplete""
Thanks!! That's what I mean too. As long as we advocate that nonbinary people can be trans too, especially considering how we can also be impacted by transphobia, that could help more nonbinary people feel assured in their identity. But this whole thing of ""you can only be cis or trans"" falls flat really fast when we already know the existence of nonbinary people.
Thanks!! Honestly transition isn't always medical, which is the first thing that always comes to everyone's mind. I'm not visibly trans at all either, but still legally changed my name and gender marker. Social transition can still be significant too, even though it takes a lot of work communicating your transness.
You're no co-opting anything. Trans doesn't look like any one thing in specific. Trans people are incredibly varied.
You don’t have to transition to be trans.
I think of agender as more of no gender, as in they don’t recognize binary as a thing. While non-binary is recognizing that most things do fall somewhere on the gender binary but ignore it because they don’t agree with it
That hasn't been my experience in 99% of trans spaces. I've found binary trans folks to be very understanding, welcoming, and willing to listen to non-binary folks. Most trans spaces are upwards of 10-20% nonbinary anyways.
I didn't say that I thought any of this. And I am well aware of this - and I have transitioned medically myself.
people can have different meanings for the same word
It means across: beyond, through. Like trans hydrogens would be attached across from each other and cis would be same side. It means the opposite of cis.

Gender is more complex of course but I don't feel the language quite matches how I feel.
I agree with a lot of what you said. I’ve had short hair before but after a while I felt like it enhanced the femme features. I also don’t feel comfortable binding because my chest is on the bigger side and it doesn’t feel safe to me.
yeah, I’m pretty much there right now
Yeah I know thought process is illogical, but I have gotten more used to calling myself trans by using the trans flag colors bc I think they’re more soothing than the non-binary flag colors (sorry! I just like pastels more ;-;)
Um, what? There *is* the societal *two* genders therefore binary but some people don't identify to be on the strict binary of man and woman. I think everyone is well aware of the gender binary. Agender people (people who identify as having no gender) are neither male nor female so they can call themselves non binary. Some agender people choose not to for multiple reasons but the one I see most is that being Agender is the absence of any gender and for that reason should be a category of its own. I recognize (and most other enbys do too)that most creatures are on the binary but we aren't. From what ive got most of us do not ignore it because we don't agree with it. We say it shouldn't remain because it is not inclusive to enough people. I still do not understand what you meant by ""they(agender people)don't recognize the binary as thing"" though
I recognize the binary is a thing, trying to ignore that is kind of a senseless endeavor. I identify outside of it because I think that the binary is pointless by default. People assign meaning to it and draw satisfaction from it, and that is perfectly fine - who am I to deny someone joy in their identity?

I don't ignore it, nor do I necessarily disagree with it. I just don't identify within it. Man? Woman? I am me. I am human. That's my identity. I share experiences with enby people and am comfortable calling myself non-binary because it is true - no gender does mean existing outside of the gender binary. Hence the term ""non-binary"". Does that make me transgender? Well, that's up to personal interpretation - how my circle defines trans will likely not be the same as how your circle defines trans.

I have been called transgender. And that's fine with me.

Sorry for the essay, I just find it easier to organize my thoughts as if I were writing a paper.
A fellow chemist?! I always think of the molecular cis and trans definitions in discussions like this. I'm not sure they're meant to be the same definitions though, so trying to educate myself reading through these comments.
Sorry I was having a hard time explaining my thought process. You explained it really well though. I didn’t mean that agender people don’t recognize the gender binary at all. Like you said my understanding of agender is that they feel a absence of gender thus they don’t recognize themselves in the binary. Sorry I’m having a hard time voicing what I’m thinking."	103c3w8	NonBinary	440	0.96	2023-01-04 19:13:18
How do y’all feel about „non-binary“ being included in the term „trans“	"Hi! Binary Trans man here looking for opinions on this from people who are actually effected by it. In my mind the term Trans just meant you identify as a different gender than the one you were assigned with at birth so I always just naturally included non-binary in the term because y’all have a different gender identity than the one assigned with at birth. But a lot of the times I see stuff like „trans/non-binary“ which just seems like a little bit exclusionary to me personally but I have no fully formed opinion on it so I was wondering how yall feel about that.

Yall are awesome btw, been checking in on this sub from time to time and you all seem like such kind people! Have a great rest of your day! :)

&#x200B;

edit: thank you all so much for commenting and sharing your insights! I sadly dont have the time to reply to everyone rn but be sure, i have most definetly read your input! :)"	"For me it depends on the situation. If the question is; Am I cis or trans, then trans, but in general conversation I would say I'm non-binary. This is mainly because in every day conversation, if you say trans, binary trans is more commonly assumed than non-binary. Also generally when trans issues are discussed these are about transitioning or people being able to use facilities that don't fit their AGAB. And these issues aren't applicable to my experience, therefore I only participate as an ally in those situations and not the target demographic.

So to explain it simply, I don't identify as trans, but my gender identity falls within the trans umbrella. So, I can be catogarized as trans, but that might cause confusion or misunderstandings about my actual identity.

Hope that made sense.
My opinion is simple: if you identify as a different gender than you were assigned at birth the trans label is available to you and it's up to you whether to take it.
I think some nonbinary people have a complicated relationship with calling themselves trans either due to internalized transphobia (not feeling ""trans enough"" to claim it), or because they actually do in part identify with their AGAB (fluid or demi genders that happen to partially include their AGAB for example) and so don't feel that the term fully fits them (of course people in this category are welcome to call themselves trans if they want to, I have just occasionally seen people who do not for this reason).

From what I've seen, the most common position is that yes, nonbinary people are trans (due to the definition you gave), but not all nonbinary people may necessarily choose to use that term to describe themselves.

(edit: The above is not an exhaustive list of potential reasons, of course. 

I have no specific thoughts on whether saying ""trans/nonbinary"" when referring to our collective communities is exclusionary or not, my first reaction is that it doesn't bother me and I would take it as the person just trying to be extra clear, but I could see how it might bother others.)
I always thought of it as trans, it never really occurred to me that it could be anything else. Although I have heard of some people who identify as cis nb.
Hi. I started identifying as nonbinary within this past year, after a lifetime of not really being aware of, or not really understanding nonbinary identities - thinking that either I was trans (i.e. a binary trans woman) or I was not, and since I was not, therefore had to make do with going through life as a cis man.

Now that I've embraced my nonbinary identity, and learned so much from communities like this one, and have come to understand the way the term trans\* is used as an umbrella term, and in particular now that I've come to appreciate how much I do have in common with binary trans folks - how much their issues and questions and experiences are similar to my own - I'm happy to feel welcomed in trans spaces and to think of myself as falling within that umbrella.

...

But, while I can absolutely see how ""trans and nonbinary"" or ""trans/nonbinary"" can be seen as odd or even exclusionary to those in the know, I personally like these sorts of compound phrases, because to many people (especially many people outside the community) I think the word ""trans"" still conjures up a relatively narrow set of ideas or identities (i.e. certain ideas or images of binary trans folks, incl. esp. trans folks pursuing a ""full"" \[whatever that means\] medical + social transition). So, having the word nonbinary actively included helps with the visibility of nonbinary identities, if that makes sense.

...

When I was first engaging in earnest with questioning my gender, the first person I came out to was a friend who happens to be a trans woman. She said, essentially, ""sounds to me like you're a trans woman too. You'd better get on HRT immediately, and start thinking about social transition and all sorts of other things or else you're in for years of horrific mental health issues like me,"" and it freaked me the hell out. I spent the next day or so, or more, my head spinning, thinking about all the things I had to do, and how difficult it was going to be, all the things I had to change (physically, legally), who to tell, how to tell them, all this stuff, fearing that if I didn't do it, I was already on my way to some kind of mental breakdown.

Learning that nonbinary was a real option for me, that it was something I might actually be and that I had a right to claim, and learning more about what nonbinary identity means and looks like, took me out of that spiral of worrying and agonizing and thinking the only two options are trans or cis. ... Yes, now that I've learned more I understand what ""trans"" includes under its umbrella, and I've grown more comfortable seeing myself as being under that umbrella.

But I still think that for others who are still questioning, or for cis community at large, the visibility provided by phrases like ""trans + nonbinary"" or ""trans/nonbinary"" could, potentially, be a rather good thing for helping people to know that we exist, that there are these other ways of being and that they're equally valid, and so forth. If I had known that more fully, more truly - if I'd seen more nonbinary representation and understood more properly what it meant sooner, I might have been able to come out to myself and be living my best life, so to speak, sooner.  


That's me; that's my personal take on it.
I am trans because I am nonbinary and not the assigned identity that was thrust upon me. I feel very firmly that:

1) nonbinary identity is a core part of transgender community, culture, history, and future. When someone says trans people, that should and does includes nonbinary people full stop. When binary trans people exclude us, they’re doing themselves a disservice.

2) no one has to use words and terms that don’t work for them.

If someone tells me they’re nonbinary, I use that word for them. If someone tells me they’re nonbinary and not trans, they are not trans. Just because I have such a strong connection between the two and therefore a desire to see nonbinary people recognized for our part and position in trans circles, that doesn’t mean my political thoughts supersede how someone else views themself.

I love being trans because I love being myself. The negatives of being seen improperly by the world are because of power structures and erasure of nonbinary identity. Being trans is a very positive and beautiful thing to be because my (lack of) gender is wonderfully freeing.

I love being nonbinary because it’s the honest version of myself.

Linguistically, we fall into speaking patterns that reflect what we see other people say. A lot of people arrive at this community saying “trans and nonbinary” and they often see them as separate things. The binary is silently expected. I think this is because in many trans circles people first find as they begin exploring gender, binary trans is the absolute dominant narrative and most power plays are between trans men and trans women for space and visibility between each other, with nonbinary trans people often discriminated against or harassed by people with internalized transphobia. I tend to write “binary and nonbinary trans people”, “binary trans people”, and “nonbinary trans people” or “nonbinary people” in order to avoid assumptions that the binary is a silent but integral part of “trans”.

#TW Nonbinary-phobia written out here.

-

Most times I enter an online trans space that is meant for all of us, I end up leaving because of ignorant statements about how nonbinary people make binary people look bad because we ask for too much, or that we’re not trans, or that we’re not real, and so on and so forth and very rarely do other binary people call them out. I’m usually left to defend myself and a huge class of diverse people alone. And then in heavily moderated spaces where this doesn’t happen, we’re usually all pushed into separate threads or channels etc where trans women are in one group, trans men in another, and everyone else in a third like we’re a third gender.

This is all VERY different from my experiences online a decade ago and my current experiences in person with trans groups. These are the spaces that affirm my connection to trans identity and keep me grounded. These are the spaces that make me feel joy having a shared experience that celebrates being authentically individual.
I consider myself Trans/Genderfluid/Nonbinary. That white stripe in the flag is for Enby. I fought it for a long time, because I thought I could not uset the term Trans, because I do not want to transition into a different part of the Binary. It took me a long time even though I knew I was Nonbinary, and even before that I had no idea there was such a range in the Rainbow community. I knew from an early age I wasnt like others in my school....I had no idea there was lots of other aspects to it. What really made me realize it was that defintion you gave, and then a little image with a large umbrella with Trans then two smaller ones, one being Binary, one bing NonBinary. It was like, my egg finally broke.
I do consider myself trans, but I'm also aware that most people think of binary trans folks when hearing the word trans. In many situations I'd feel the need to clarify because of this. It kind of depends on the situation how exactly I'd describe myself. If someone asks about my gender identity, I'd say I'm nonbinary. If someone asks why I care about trans rights, I'd sipmly say ""because I'm trans"". If someone asks me if I'm trans I'd say yes but specify that I'm nonbinary.

I wonder if, because being non binary is a wide spectrum of experience and identity, that's why some of us struggle with ""trans"" as a label because it feels quite definitive and to an extent limiting.

I think many of us started feeling that being trans was a sort of obvious explanation for not feeling cis, and then through a (usually very slow) process felt uncomfortable with that because it too didn't quite fit.
For me, and definitely only speaking for me here, my personal brand of enby involves a connection to my assigned gender (man) which is a large part of my presentation, as well as a connection to my femininity, and a large dose of agender as well. I just don’t fit the binary. I don’t feel a connection to the term trans, so I don’t associate it with myself. This might be some internal transphobia to work through so it might change over time. It’s also because I still feel connected to male pronouns while also feeling connected to neutral pronouns.

I don’t have many irl connections to the LGBT2Q+ community, and so I’m just figuring a lot of this out from looking inside of myself for what feels right on my own (with the exception of my awesome genderqueer therapist).

Politically/socially, I feel very aligned/connected with trans folks, but the label just doesn’t feel like me (at least for now).

That ramble probably isn’t helpful, but there it is! Have an awesome day beautiful people!
I absolutely identify as trans... Some enby people don't, and like... 🤷? That's their prerogative. I didn't really feel comfortable accepting the trans label earlier in my transition when I was still questioning. But for me realizing I'm definitely not a woman cinched for me the fact that I get to call myself trans.
Yes, non-binary is included in the trans umbrella. Some non-binary people, however, don't call themselves trans and that's totally okay. It's up to each individual.
I identify as trans and non binary. I do so because there are traits about being a woman that make me uncomfortable. There are traits about being a man that make me uncomfortable. Neither of them are just the *right* fit for me, so I’m doing my own thing. BUT, and this is why I call myself trans also, I have a lot of body dysphoria. I’m on hormones. I’m getting surgery. I, too, have fears about being beaten when people see I have a beard and my ID says I’m female. I, too, struggle with being afraid to pick what bathroom to go into.
Idk, the only thing that separates me from being FTM is that I’m uncomfortable identifying as a male. I’m uncomfortable with that solely because of American society and the ways that makes abuse the privilege that they have. For that reason, I don’t want to be identified with them. But I share all the struggles a FTM would face. 

So anyways, I identify as enby and trans.
I’m non-binary, but don’t really consider myself trans. I have done nothing to change myself or to transition since accepting being non-binary. I’m not changing my name, and have no surgery or hormone treatment planned. 

I’m just me. And yeah 1000% of people will look  at me a see a women, but I know. My partner knows. My friends know. And im gonna go about my life not having nearly the same social struggles as someone who is trans and transitioning. 

Just my view point.
I don’t like being called trans. Even though it technically fits I just don’t like it, and I’m a firm believer that I don’t have to use a label I don’t want.
To me, I've always felt like being nonbinary isn't ""trans enough ""  even though I know that's not really a thing. But also I feel like to use the term transgender as an underlying term for an entire community of gender non-conforming folk,  might be, somehow, taking a peace of identity from the transgender community, whose already had so much taken from them. So in a way, I feel like I can't use the term trans because I personally have not had the same battles. . . Ish. This is how I feel personally about it, the logical part of me would slap the trans-insecure part of me because I know thats not true at all. It comes from a place of insecurity I think. Maybe its denial? I'm not sure. But that's my reasoning behind it, and I'd like to rehittorate again- this reasoning is ONLY pertaining to me personally. If someone said something like this to one of my NB friends I'd lose my shit. Again, this comes from a personal place of insecurity and shouldn't be used in anyway against my trans friends.
It depends on the person really. I personally consider nonbinary to be included under trans, but one of my nonbinary friends doesn't consider themselves to be trans. I think for me, since I feel more fluid, it naturally feels like I'm trans on days I don't feel like my agab. For my friend, I think they feel close enough still to their agab that it doesn't feel like they are trans
At first I didn’t see myself as trans bc I didn’t think it/I counted but now I do. I relate to the trans expierence so I do consider myself trans.
Hello! I agree with you. To be transgender is to not identify with the gender you were assigned at birth.

To me, this means anyone who is not cisgendered is transgender. This can be people who identify as the opposite gender (I use ""opposite"" loosely as there really are more than 2 and they don't all oppose each other cleanly), or as someone who identifies as a third gender from the binary, all genders, no genders, any gender, or some combination thereof. 

Personally, I'm proud to be transgender. I'm also proud to be non-binary. Sometimes it's easier to say I'm trans then open with non-binary as that's still a bit new for some people. I'm always happy to elaborate if they ask, though. And I tend to anyway since my pronouns are they/them.

I'll add a disclaimer that I'm still new to this community and don't know all the different terms, so I apologize heavily if I've said anything wrong. Everyone has the right to identify however they want, and be happy. Love you guys!
I am trans. I had a discussion with my doctor not so long ago filling out a form and they asked me how I identify. I said, “Trans”. 

Because she was looking at the form and I wasn’t, her next question was, “Are you a trans man or a trans woman?”

Of course, I simply said, “No”.

Then she turned the screen to me and I could see that there was a completely different box for non-binary. So I said to her, “I’m trans non-binary. Tick non-binary then write what I am in the ‘other’ section. Nice to know that in an attempt to be inclusive, my identity is still relegated to being ‘other’, even if only partly.”

I think it’s an important distinction. Not every enby is going to be comfortable with being called trans, and in the context of intersex people it’s not an accurate label, but in the case of many of us, it’s our identity.
I dont identify as trans because while my internal change has been vast my external change has been nuanced and feels minor by comparison. It would just feel wrong to me personally.
I think it depends on the nonbinary person as to whether they identify as trans or not. I identify as nonbinary and genderqueer. I do consider myself to be trans, because my gender identity is not the one that was assigned to me at birth.

However, when I talk to cisgender folks about this, or anyone else outside the NB community, I don’t bring up that I’m trans right away. Because there is a lot of cultural baggage surrounding the word transgender. And as lots of other folks have pointed out, cisgender folks, and those outside the Trans and NB communities, seem to always tie transitioning with transgender. And this can complicate explaining being NB to folks.
The definition of trans that I use is “doesn’t completely identify with gender assigned at birth.” So, being non-binary, I am technically trans. But I understand that my experience may differ quite drastically with someone who transitions from mtf or ftm so I honestly don’t mention it that way a lot. Only when I’m explaining it to someone.
My definition of trans is ""I do not vibe with my agab"" (to make it short!) 

Also the white stripe of the trans flag stands for non binary.

So yeah. I am non binary, I will call myself trans.
I'm nonbinary because I'm not a man or a woman, and I'm trans because I don't identify with my gender assigned at birth/have taken steps to transition to alieviate my dysphoria. :)
Being trans means identifying with something other than what you were assigned at birth. I am both nb and trans. Its difficult for me to understand how you could be nb and not trans since not identifying with the binary or any gender means not identifying with the gender you were assigned at birth.

Why is trans/nb excluding? I would say that trans is the umbrella term so not sure why you would put both next to each other in that way, but I also can't see what is wrong with it.
I am nonbinary (AFAB) and don’t identify as trans. While I don’t identify as female, I just started fully identifying as nonbinary in the last year or two, and I am still in a lot of female roles (mom most specifically). I don’t feel trans enough, I guess, to take on that label. I’ve never experienced transphobia against myself or had to deal with convincing doctors to give me hormones or surgery.
I think for some people the word ""trans"" carries the implication of binary trans, hence the phrasing of things like ""trans/nonbinary"" -- this is language that I like to use personally, because I feel like it removes some ambiguity from the words. like if we were to use the umbrella term ""trans"" on its own, implicitly including nonbinary people under that umbrella, we'd run into the problem of a kind of erasure/exclusion due to the ambiguity of the language. for example, some trans people would push back against the idea that nonbinary people should be included under that umbrella, and some nonbinary people might be reluctant to take on the label of trans for any number of reasons.
Personally, I identify with being ""trans"" because I am actually medically transitioning- just halfway to androgyny instead of fully across the way. Hormones and surgery have made my body distinctly different than it was.

Obv I understand this doesn't apply to everyone and anybody can label themselves however they prefer, that's just my individual rationalization of words meaning things
Hi. I’m non-binary. I’m proudly transgender because I don’t identify with the gender assigned to me at birth. I’ll say “trans/non-binary” to be specific when necessary.
To my thinking, if 'trans' means 'doesn't identify with gender assigned at birth', nonbinary would be definition be trans.
I love the trans flag and I love the label for me! I feel like it describes me, and the white stripe in the middle of the flag is a little special treat. I don’t feel in between genders, not in the middle, but outside of them 
I usually write it, or say it, as non-binary trans-masculine, so without the / . For me that just means that each of the pieces go together and are one, rather than either/or (not saying anyone else is using it as either/or! That’s how it reads in my brain when I specifically write it for myself, it’s also a way to put ‘and’) 
I am really curious, to better understand where you’re coming from as well!! You have an important perspective and are coming to the subreddit to learn, I’d love to learn more about you too! Can you say more (and also don’t have to) about feeling “exclusionary”? Doesn’t have to be a fully formed opinion, just what it brings to mind :)
I include the term in my nonbinary identity because fully living as a nonbinary person for me includes certain aspects of medical intervention to transition, even though realistically the cost is prohibitive.
I personally identify more strongly with the trans label than the non-binary label.   

I didn't realize that some NB people don't consider themselves trans, which is...confusing to me.
i am a nonbinary person, and i absolutely identify with trans. part of why i identify that way is because i am physically and socially transition, like binary trans people do. i have changed my name and pronouns, i take hormones. i feel very strongly that i am “transing” my gender lol. some nonbinary people might not feel this way, or they may identify as trans without physically/socially transitioning. i think anyone who doesn’t identify with their assigned gender at birth would be totally within their right to identify as trans, but don’t have to if they don’t think it’s accurate

another note is a few friends of mine that are intersex personally identify as “cis nonbinary”. for some this is complicated, because intersex people might be assigned a binary sex at birth despite being intersex, or they may undergo unwanted medical changes in order to look like a binary sex. and because of this, if they transition away from that coercively assigned sex, they still might identify as trans. but! a few intersex friends of mine feel as though their body correctly reflects their gender, and for them being intersex and nonbinary is not trans because they find their body to be “nonbinary” on its own. so they would identify as cis nonbinary

that’s a complicated idea bc in our binary society there really is no way to exist and be raised as truly cis and also nonbinary, purely bc of how we are treated. the binary touches every part of our lives, even if our body doesn’t look binary. but identifying that way is important for some intersex people, and i think listening to them on that is necessary. sorry for the super long post haha, i hope it was interesting at least!!
I really struggled with this one at first. For as long as I can remember, I've always thought of myself as just a human being, rather than particularly identifying as a girl/woman (AFAB) but it didn't really occur to me that I am non-binary until I was into my 30s. 

My wife is binary trans and I've known about that since we were in our early 20s so I guess I initially felt that 'trans' was an exclusively binary thing because that's all I knew.

I'm also only out to a couple of people so the world generally assumes I'm a woman. To me, this makes or has made it hard for me to consider myself ""properly"" trans because I go through life mostly being seen as and treated as my birth sex and I feel a bit like an imposter in the trans community because of this.

These days, my understanding is a little bit different though and I definitely consider myself to be both nb and trans, for the reasons you and others have already mentioned: I don't identify (solely) with my assigned gender at birth.

I don't know if that answers your question. Sorry if I've just rambled!
I use both words. Trans is easier and a little more satisfying of a word lol. But I’m also not FTM and so I will use nonbinary as like an extra explanation for the majority of cis people who don’t understand nonbinary identities and think trans just equals ftm/mtf.
For me personally, I’ve always identified as non-binary but I was never sure if I was able to call myself trans. Sure, I technically could since I was identifying with a different gender than I was assigned, but it didn’t feel right to claim that identity since I wasn’t actively transitioning or even trying to present masculine or even androgynous. I’ve been on T for two months and have been working to masculinize my appearance, and I have been starting to use trans as an identifier. However, I still prefer non-binary overall since my goal for my medical transition is not to be a binary man
Not all nonbinary people identify as trans for whatever reasons so I think it's to include them, I personally do identify as trans.
I always thought of it being included too because it's a gender other than your agab, it just makes sense to me that way.

But I can see why some NB folk don't ID as trans as it can be so nuanced. Especially I guess if you are agender or something like that where you don't think of yourself in the way of conventional genders.

I might be biased towards thinking of myself as trans though as I did ID as binary trans for a few years before I knew that nonbinary is a thing.
I’m genderfluid and sometimes I identify as a binary man but the rest of my identities (that I’m currently aware of) are non-binary. I used to identify only as a man, which is not my AGAB. So I considered myself trans as well and I started transitioning. I still very much identify with how I’ve transitioned, if that makes sense. I just do not always feel like a binary man. 

I personally consider myself trans cuz no matter what gender I am, I am never my AGAB and I have been on hormones so I have definitely changed physically. Actually, quite a few people think I’m the opposite AGAB now. So even when my identity does not fit the binary, I still medically/physically identify as trans, if that makes sense. For me that’s just what fits. 

The label “trans” is always sort of an afterthought for me when referring to myself. Trans is never part of my gender identity itself, but I use it to explain my experience with gender and my body. This is just how I feel and other people are more than welcome to use these labels in a different way for themselves.
Someone mentioned that the trans term is inherently inclusive of non-binary identities, but it's up for the person to decide if the label is for them. I very much agree with that statement. With me, my reasoning for not identifying with the trans label is that whenever I have been in trans spaces, I have experienced issues with binary trans people minimizing my issues, saying I have it easier for only going ""halfway"". At best, I've been treated as if I'm a trans man, and at worst, I've been treated as if I was essentially a cis woman. Neither were gender affirming, especially since I get dysphoria around both masculinity and femininity. 

Even in a support group setting, I was told trans women have it harder when I was talking about experiencing dysphoria in my French classes due to the language being so gendered/not having any gender neutral options. I never said I had it the worst, but that doesn't mean that I don't experience my own struggles unique to being non-binary. I kept being told my issues were just a watered down version of the issues trans men face but that simply isn't true. 

Now I don't feel comfortable in trans spaces nor do I feel good anymore when people use the term ""trans"" to describe me. I've talked about this before with other non-binary people and it seems that I'm not alone in my experiences, although I'm definitely not saying that all trans spaces are like the ones I have encountered. 

Maybe someday when I'm over that trauma (I was harassed by binary trans people over these matters), I'll identify as trans again. But I'm not there yet and the label is currently triggering for me.

Edit: Meanwhile my partner doesn't identify as trans for a completely different reason. They're agender. They have basically described it to me that since they do not experience gender in anyway, it doesn't make sense for them to identify as transgender; being ""transgender"" would imply having a gender.
basically: eehhhhhueueuehhhhmmmm hoo uhhhhhhhhhhh wheeewwwwww yes???? I mean definitionally yes, and if any nonbinary person identified as trans they are entirely correct, but as has been said its circumstantial. my sister is a full on trans woman, and shes on hormones and stuff (which I don't plan to ever do) and.... it would just feel really odd for me to compare NY struggle with hers, yknow? I'm not on hormones, no surgery, alterations, nothing. any ninbinary person who considers themselves trand is definitely right, and I sorta do with some people, but just for me, in general, because of my sister, no, not really.
If you realize that you are not the gender you were assigned at birth, then you are trans. That's how it's always been. ""Transgender"" isn't magically tied to the binary; all non-binary genders are valid, so they count for being trans just as well as the more well-known binary.
I do not identify as trans at all. To me, claiming that identity feels almost appropriative, acting like I've had experiences (like experiencing transphobia) that I haven't really had. I'm don't feel like I'm transitioning to anything.

If someone asked if I were trans or cis, I'd answer the same way I would if they asked if I were a man or a woman: ""No.""
The words are for you to use. I call myself a non binary woman, and I feel no reason to explain myself. It’s how I feel I am. It’s the word that make the most sense to me right now, and they can always change.
I am non-binary (agender) and also identify as trans. I do not intend to look like my birth gender as I have no… I guess I would say connection to it, but I don’t connect with an identity of the opposite of my AGAB. 
I have altered myself and my lifestyle to better fit how I identify.

It’s freeing for me. 

However being non-binary is different from person to person. One person may like how they are and embrace it and that’s totally valid. 

On a side note my fiancée is a binary trans woman we will often commiserate over similar things. It is nice to have someone who understands.
Trans is an umbrella term but not everyone under the umbrella has to use it. Every body is non binary but some people still attach to the label and they're welcome to it.
When a form or whatnot has “trans/nonbinary” I have to assume it in an attempt to include nonbinary folk who do not identify with the label of trans, regardless of whether or not it applies to them. For example, someone who was AMAB who is actually agender, may be uncomfortable with the label of transgender, as they are not a “different gender”— they have NO gender.

It’s much similar to folks who prefer to be known as genderqueer rather than nonbinary. Rather than an intrinsic difference in definitions, its more-so a difference of identity labels.
Nother question, doe genderfluid count as NB?
Food for thought:

The root word Cis- means “on the same side as”

The root word Trans- means “on the opposite side of”

Both terms imply a binary. So, semantically speaking, trans and non-binary is a contradiction.

Of course these words mean more than just their etymology, and culturally the label trans is becoming more of an umbrella.

Personally, I don’t use trans because I’m a very logical person and it’s hard for me to reconcile that binary implication.
The flag has the white strip for a reason !! We're just a different type
Personally I do not believe that non binary people should be included as part of the term trans, because what you decide you identify is what YOU decide, not other people. I identify as non binary because I do not wish to identify as any gender, specifically my AGAB, but I don't identify as any other gender either. I don't feel like Trans fits me because of this.
I personally dont see myself as trans due to mostly idemtifying on the side of my AGAB,I just dont see it as really fitting me,but Nonbinary is Trans.
Until very recently, I thought it was the other way around and that “Non-binary” was the umbrella term for any gender identity that wasn’t cis and that trans people fell under that category but now I guess “Trans” is the umbrella term and enbies fall underneath that? 😅 I don’t know and I could’ve made the wrong assumption I’m new to this thing haha
[deleted]
Some nonbinary people consider ourselves trans, some don’t. Technically we do fall under the umbrella from a dictionary standpoint, but whether a person uses the term “trans” is just down to individual choice. I say “trans and nonbinary” a lot, to make sure I include those nonbinary folks who don’t consider themselves trans, and also cause people can be both : )
This is just my personal explanation why i am nonbinary but dont consider myself trans. Of course others will feel differently.

Basically i didnt ""transition"" from anything into nonbinary. I always have felt and presented nonbinary. Even as a toddler i would express my gender/personality through my clothes or who i enjoyed playing with. I never felt like a guy or a girl specifically, i just exist in a human body. I never had a word for that until recently though. Like i couldn't care less if my body was like a barbie doll or if it was like a macho man, or somewhere in the middle, my gender is internal and it defines itself within. I have always been nonbinary, i never really made any huge changes that would be called a ""transition."" I feel like i just accepted my identity.

I do feel uncomfortable when i dress overly feminine but maybe thats just self esteem and not necessarily my gender identity.

To me, the persons AGAB/body has nothing to do with their gender. For example, i may dress androgynous because i enjoy that, but someone dressed otherwise could still be any gender and i dont know that unless i ask. Someone can call me she/he/they and i don't care what they pick.
NB falls under the trans umbrella, but there are quite a few reasons to separate them when discussing. The general public is pretty aware of binary trans people through media, but a lot of people are still confused or unaware about NB. Unfortunately there are binary trans people and general public who want to exclude NBs from the term or discussions or like to invalidate them (there's a lot to dig into there so I won't expand on that). It increases visibility because they are often overlooked. Some NBs are uncomfortable using the term trans, this may or may not be related to the above reasons, they can also be related to  privileges, passing, or identification with their agab.
I identify as bigendered: I am my assigned gender at birth, but I am also the other gender.

Therefore, I do not feel that trans fits my experience, because I have not ""transitioned away"" from my birth gender but added another gender to it.
I think non-binary people should be able to choose individually if they identify with the term. Non-binary may ""technically"" be under the trans umbrella, and some NB people embrace it and should be welcome to. Others don't, however, and shouldn't be forced to. 

I personally don't identify with it because I'm mainly agender in a way where I don't feel or understand an ""innate"" gender, and I have only experienced gender peripherally through socialization. So I'm not ""a different gender than my assigned gender,"" I have no gender and I'm slightly aligned with female-ness through my agab. (e.g.: my prefered pronouns are they/them, but she/her does not cause me dysphoria, but if you called me he/him I'd be like what???? where did that come from?)

So, because of the way I personally experience gender (very subtly if at all) I don't identify as trans. It's not a community or experience I feel like I'm part of, not because I'm being excluded but just because of who I am. I know many people have very different experiences and may feel both trans and non-binary, or they may feel that cis/trans is itself another binary they don't happen to fall into.

Basically, it's good to be inclusive and welcoming, but don't try to force/convince someone to adopt a label that doesn't fit! It's not always because of an internalized phobia, sometimes it's just a different experience than you understand first-hand.
I identify as nonbinary but not trans. I've not experienced the same intense disphoria as my trans friend nor have I gone through any of main struggles associated with the binary trans experience. I don't want to discount her experiences. I am fine with being under the trans umbrella, it's just not a label I'd use for myself.
Outside of the internet queer community the vast majority of people still define the word transgender as the opposite of cisgender. The idea of trans meaning anything other than your agab is relatively new (within the last couple of years). Prior to this it would have been insulting to my trans brothers and sisters for my enby ass to be calling myself trans. Now that it seems to be ok with the majority of trans folks it’s too late, if I told anyone in my life that i am trans they would understand that to mean that i am a male (afab), i am not, however male. If i say I’m nonbinary they don’t really know what it means, but they don’t assume I’m going to start taking testosterone and change my name pronouns.  Until that changes, transgender used to mean anything other than the opposite of cisgender   confuses people, including myself and in an exhausting and invalidating way. Nonbinary still confused people but it was not in use with one meaning for decades and now has a different one. 

But don’t worry, I’m old, I’m probably the last generation that will have heard trans used exclusively as the opposite of cis my entire life.

This is a tired and worn out question. Nonbinary is a subset of the transgender lable, just the same as being binary trans
[deleted]
Well I'm not cis, so...
I like being called trans. I call myself a trans enby
i think its fine

it certainly makes things easier to explain 

and trans means not being your AGAB so nonbinary is trans anyway

also some nb ppl are also transmasc or transfem
For me I find it tougher to say I am trans even tho non-binary folks ARE included in there (the white stripe). I’m afab and demigirlflux and this means at my most feminine I’m partially connected to femininity/womanhood (demigirl) and at my least feminine I’m not connected to gender (agender). Since most of the time I’m *partially* connected to my agab I feel like I’m more a mix of intrafeminine and Transneutral.
i think about it the same way as you.  if cis is using your assigned gender at birth then, nonbinary falls under the umbrella of trans.  i know some people might disagree and thats fine (as long as you're describing your own identity and not mine), they get to identify how they want, but i identify as nonbinary and consider myself trans.


i never felt bugged by seeing ""trans/nonbinary"".  it feels nice to be seen and i dont mind the distinction between binary and nonbinary trans folks.
I am a genderfluid demigirl and, like many others, I struggle with being not “cis enough” to pass as non-binary, let alone trans. 

Which, I feel like many uneducated or open ppl think of trans as the opposite of what you were assigned to at birth, since I was assigned female at birth, in what I imagine most people’s minds, if I don’t look like a man then im not trans. 

Realize, that when I say “most ppl” I mostly mean uneducated closed minded and cold ppl like my father who has always pushed for my domestic and female side, and that brought along all types of anxiety about having hair and acne on my body and other insecurities about mu body. 

All this is to say that I’ve always loved feeling “cute and being cared for” and I’ve always loved being nurturing and caring for others.” I believe that ALL ppl can do and be these things, so I want it without the connotation of “female” attached to it. 

Anyway, I’d love it if one day non-binary could be 100% accepted as a part of trans and that one day I could be comfortable enough to call myself trans, bc until it’s a bit more accepted and I don’t have to give a small lecture explaining what I mean by “I am trans” it’s not going to get better (for me), it’s not. 

lol sorry couldn’t resist the Lorax rhyme ^w^
I'd consider myself trans as I'm no longer the gender I was assigned at birth. 

I also do it to be in solidarity with my binary trans brothers and sisters. Queers together strong.

I do have days where imposter syndrome hits hard though and on those days it's just hard in general to identify with anything and feel right about it.
It's accurate. I am non-binary and I am trans.
I feel like the enbies who don’t identify as trans are the ones who still have some connection to their AGAB. Maybe they don’t feel trans enough or don’t feel like the trans label gets across what they are, which is perfectly fine. 

I do identify as trans because I have no connection to my AGAB or the other binary gender.
i've identified as non-binary for years and have been a trans ally for even longer. it only dawned on me when i started physically transitioning to more femme presenting that i am in fact trans. i honestly have always felt a strong kinship with the trans community and while I recognize that my (mtx) experience is not totally the same as an mtf trans person, it felt so validating and so *right* when i started to refer to myself as trans. i *am* in the process of transitioning from my agab to my authentic gender, after all.

i know some people feel differently about this topic, but no one's going to stop me from identifying however I choose, and the general consensus does appear to be that non-binary folks are considered trans.
Personally I find I fit under the trans umbrella, for the same reasoning you stated of not being my agab. I usually am specific in conversation, but gravitate towards trans friendly spaces because they are more likely to be ok with me.
I'm nonbinary, and while I *do* fit under the trans umbrella I don't use the labels ""trans"" or ""transgender"" verbatim. I use transandrogynous. Also in terms of unicode emotes I don't use the trans flag or rainbow flag emotes but I do use the trans symbol emote.
I was super hesitant about the term because I thought it implied you're transitioning, but once I learned it really just meant not being AGAB, yeah I'm proud to say trans. I would just say non-binary if people asked, but I identify as trans.

I think it especially makes sense for me because yeah, I don't see my gender in the mirror. I'm fine with how I look, but I almost see someone female even though I look very male. And I don't call myself genderfluid, but I have felt fluid. That's not a cis experience. I'm not cis for sure.
i really don't mind it honestly. it depends on what i tend to go by
As an umbrella term yes.  Since when it is an umbrella term it just means not cis.  Which nonbinary is, so I don't mind.
I wasn't assigned non binary at birth so I consider myself trans, plus our needs are similar enough that I'm happy to fight alongside my binary siblings
We are trans by definition.  Some of us don't want to accept it, but all of us are.  If you don't 100% identify as your agab then, congratulations, you're trans.
isn’t the white stripe on the trans flag for nonbinary people
As far as I'm concerned, as a non binary person, transgender means that you have transitioned from your assigned gender to another. I have transitioned from my assigned gender to my real gender, so I am transgender. 

However I have no problem when people say ""trans/nonbinary"" and feel the opposite of exclusion. Many people don't know about or understand non binary genders so when you specify non binary it lets me know that you are not just talking about binary trans people. It lets me know that I am included.
i am very comfortable with the label trans, I call myself trans all the time because I see the trans community like a huge diverse place where people experiences gender differently and that's really beautiful to me lol, but yeah there's been times when people mistakes me as a trans man despite being non-binary (more specifically agender) and it really sucks because I always specify that I'm non-binary on my social media and on conversations so people won't be confused
I think it’s fine tbh
they/he pronouns
I personally see it as I was one gender in the past, and then I later transited my gender to being non-binary. That being said, I know some people prefer to not see themselves this way and view being non-binary as outside of being trans, so I don't mind making a distinction for them. This doesn't make my own view seem excluded to me. I personally don't care much for labels as these exist for the benefit of other people to get a rough idea of how I identify before they really get to know me and all my unique qualities. I am me, non-binary is just a description of one little aspect of me.
I’m non binary and I’m trans. As far as I’m concerned, trans is a big umbrella that holds a lot of things, non-binary being one of them.
I don't identify with the gender I was assigned at birth, which means I'm trans. Of course it's an individual thing, but generally yes I think non binary is under the trans umbrella.
For me, (as a non binary identifying queer) I personally question why they are always lumped together. I feel honored to be sharing space with trans folx but many times I feel like when we’re lumped together in such spaces, I wonder if I’m taking up space that takes away from the trans community feeling seen and supported enough. 

Yes, I’m having my own personal journey, experiences and struggles as a NB person but I think trans folx have had it historically really hard and continue to in a different way than NB folx. I just want to make sure I’m not taking away from the trans advocacy initiative that still needs all the support we can give it. 

And not all trans people are non binary. Many want the exact opposite; to be seen FOR their gender. I don’t think it’s fair to assume all trans folx want to be lumped together with non binary & vice versa.
I’m trans as fuck and proud to say it
i recently came out as non-binary & am still figuring out how i want to present myself. currently i acknowledge that me being non-binary falls under the trans umbrella, but i don’t feel right calling myself trans. even though i use they/them pronouns & don’t like being called a girl or anything of that nature, i still have a very femme appearance. because of this i also struggle to feel like i fit in with the non-binary community, tho i have been getting better with accepting that i am a part of this community no matter how i look. i guess i just don’t feel like i should call myself trans when my appearance still lines up with my AGAB, especially when i’m still working on accepting that i am non-binary no matter how i look. this is just how i feel personally, everyone is different. i’m working on figuring out what labels feel right & right now this is how i feel. i am non-binary through & through. though i don’t mind being grouped in with trans people, even though i feel like i don’t belong. i just personally won’t say i’m trans if someone asks, ill always say i’m non-binary.
I definitely consider myself trans. I automatically consider all nb people as trans too, unless someone specifically doesn’t like it for themselves.
Am non-binary am trans. Some people want to highlight that they aren’t binary trans because people automatically assume that most of the time. Some people don’t feel comfortable labeling themselves as trans for a number of reasons, like associating being trans with transitioning, or being agender so they aren’t moving to a different gender.
In my opinion, trans is an umbrella term, so as has been stated here by others, if there is only an option between cis and trans (on forms for example) obviously I’d pick trans, but if I have the freedom, I’d say that yes, I’m nonbinary. Also, as someone who uses neopronouns and is also leaning towards xenogender type identity, trans is a very helpful and useful blanket term because very few people seem to “get” nonbinary, let alone the xenogender aspects

Also just a quick note for the other posters in this thread, “nb” stands for “non-black” and should be reserved for our BIPOC communities, opt instead for enby, nBi, nonbinary etc
I like it
on an individual level first - if you feel you are nonbinary then call yourself that, if you feel you are trans then call yourself that, and you may pick one, the other, both, or neither. it's NOT up to any member of the community (trans or not) to police whether or not you technically are/n't something - you are whatever you say you are, end of story. 

that in mind, i prefer ""trans/nb"" or ""genderqueer"" to just saying trans because not all nb folks decide to also take the label of trans. this way is *more* inclusive because of that.
Im not sure really. I think trans (as a nonbinary person) refers to you having to actually transition. Like if you have to actively make a change, instead of realizing that oh damn I'm just non binary. I suppose its different for everyone tho
Logically it does make sense and I would consider myself trans also the trans flag the white part is to signify a nonbinary so we're part of the flag
I think, as someone who’s used both to explain my identity and experience; it’s really important to keep identities open to whomever wants to use them. Gatekeeping that you can’t be both trans AND nonbinary keeps things exclusive and just separates our community more than helps explain any one experience.
In my opinion nana bananas aren't cis, of course and I believe that they are trans because trans is changing your gender, and non-binaries change their gender, also personally as a non-binary I don't really care if I am considered trans or not but others might do so, it's always better to be a member of a group when other people don't support you. Anyways that's my opinion, goodbye to all the eggs and nana bananas.
I'm non-binary. I consider myself to be trans because I am not the gender I was assigned at birth
I actively don’t like when non binary is not included under trans.
I used to use non-binary as a way of telling myself I'm not trans and now I feel like It's not considered trans enough
We are the white stripe in the trans flag. We’ve always been included. 

There is MTF, FTM, and us: NB.
Maybe interesting wrinkle I haven't seen addressed here yet: I know at least one person who is intersex and nonbinary but doesn't ID with being trans at *all* because their agab from birth is nonbinary. I wonder if this will come up more for intersex folks when more countries have more gender options on IDs
Nonbinary people ARE included in the trans umbrella. It is an opt out not opt in identity. Every single argument against including us has been recycled TERF rhetoric (ie you need to transition, you need to be binary, you need dysphoria, etc) 
(Ofc nobody needs to id as it if they don't want to but I really think people need to begin examining WHY they don't for the reasons above. Nobody should feel like they aren't ""trans enough"". There is no test you need to pass.)

I personally hate it when people automatically exclude/separate us.
I'm non binary and trans but was a more binary trans person before I came out as such so I don't feel that's gonna be very illuminating for you as I think it's very common to do so in that situation.
I 100% consider myself to be transgender but I always describe myself as ""nonbinary"" or ""nonbinary transgender"" to others because ""transgender"" by itself is often misinterpreted as meaning binary transgender. When using words, I have to consider how they will be interpreted by others.
I does! Thank you for commenting! :)
This is very eye opening to me. What is your specific identity, if you don’t mind me asking (or do you just identify as non-binary)?

I’m bigender. Depending on how I’m leaning on any given day, I’m either a trans man or I’m transmasc. I have no tie to my AGAB, and therefore have always found identifying as trans a no-brainer; after all, I’m transitioning. 

I usually present myself as binary trans in situations where the non-binary aspect of myself is not specifically relevant, because no part of my experience *isn’t* transmasc, despite my being non-binary.
Came here to write this but didn't knew how but then i saw that you already explained it perfectly lol
I can see this entirely! When meeting new people I always say “non-binary,” or “non-binary transgender,” to differentiate from trans men / trans women. 

Then again, I’m from the old school (tm) Leslie Feinberg era when “trans” was an inclusive label for us all. I also use the “t-word” (trans, not any slurs!) as a pushback against the internalized transphobia I felt for several years. 

If “trans” today really does mean “non-non-binary,” then I’ll stop using it. Would hate to misgender myself!
~*smol gasp*~ there are others like meeee!
I like the way you put it: available to you. Labels are there to help us define our subjective perception of our /own/ existence to other people. If we don't feel it defines us, then we don't have to let others tell us that it does.
That makes sense, thank you for commenting!
Great way of saying it, I often use the phrase: ""Labels are descriptive, not prescriptive."" It's short and catchy (In my opinon), but your phrasing makes it clearer.
If I had a Reddit award right now, it would go to you. Remind me to come back in approx 17h when Reddit gives me my next freebie.


I am living for the eloquence of ""available to you""! 😭💜
I agree with this, but I wanted to add:

>OP:

>Trans just meant you identify as a different gender than the one you were assigned with at birth

We're entering an era when parents are given more freedom regarding their parenting choices and gender. Some places allow people to mark birth certificates with an X instead of male or female. 

There is a chance that in the future, a parent might assign X at birth to a child who is nonbinary and we'll start to see cis nonbinary people.

Thank you so much for your insight!
It does bother me a bit, because it implies only non-nonbinary people are trans and non-binaries are something else, or even cis. That’s just my personal feeling, however.
Your reasons are wrong for me- i am a nonbinary person and my “complicated relationship” is that the word trans means across or to cross over, it is, quite literally the opposite of cis and that is the way the word was used and understood by the community for over 20 years. Only in the past year or two am I suddenly hearing the word trans as meaning your gender not being the one assigned at birth. If I started telling the people in my life that I am trans they would all think I meant that I am a man (afab). If i say I’m nonbinary they do not make that assumption. 

I’m fine with them being separate. I’m not trans as the majority of people still define the word today.
This exactly.
This is a pretty good explanation. I consider myself non-binary, but I don't consider myself trans because I'm demi.

However, I think non-binary can fall under the trans umbrella.
Idk if this is still as much of a thing anymore, but at one point, like 3-4 years ago, there was also a transmisogynistic movement in the non-binary community.  Those particular folks were trying to avoid the trans label specifically to remove themselves from the proximity of trans women.  It's been awhile since I've run across it, but I've always been wary of other non-binary people who don't identify as trans after getting harassed by them.
yeah I'm afab and like demigirl or something so I'm fem presenting and trans (as in I wasn't assigned nb at birth) but definitely not transfem.
Thank you!
Thank you so much for sharing your perspective! I really appreciate your insight! :)
>I started identifying as nonbinary within this past year, after a lifetime of not really being aware of, or not really understanding nonbinary identities - thinking that either I was trans (i.e. a binary trans woman) or I was not, and since I was not, therefore had to make do with going through life as a cis man.

It was similar for me. The only trans people I heard about when young were people who matched the stereotype checklist. Not matching up to their experiences exactly made it hard to accept being trans when being cis didn't match up either.
Im sorry you go through that, nobody should be subjected to that amount of harassment especially from people in your own community! Thank you so much for sharing your perspective and insight with me, I really appreciate it! :)
I agree entirely

Thank you for sharing your perspective on it! :)
Alright, thank you so much for your insight! :)
Thank you so much for you perspective on it!
Huh I feel the exact opposite on your take on the trans label. I actually see it as less limiting. But tbh both labels, in a cis world, are limiting. Non binary people must be androgynous and use they/them pronouns while trans people must dress masc or fem and use pronouns that align with such (in a cis world). While we know that isn’t the case, I think it’s important that people realize that these labels only need to mean something to us, not the world around us.
It was helpful! Thank you so much for sharing your perspective! :) have an awesome day too!
Thank you for sharing your perspective!

Thank your for sharing yours and the perspective of your friend!
Thank you for commenting!
I also don’t think it’s wrong but I was wondering about the opinion of y’all because it actually affects you. So thank you so much for your perspective and insight! :)
I feel like i can be nb and not consider myself trans necessarily because i actually never worried about my AGAB. Honestly this could be because my family didnt dwell too hard when i chose something outside my AGAB. So i can understand if your family kinda forced a gender onto you then coming out as nonbinary can literally be transitioning. But since i never had a ""transition"" cuz i was able to be myself gender wise, i dont consider myself trans.
This definition of trans is relatively new (within the last few years) for decades before that trans was meant in the binary sense, so for those of us who have understood and used the term exclusively in a binary sense it’s not as simple as it is for you. Language is fluid and i appreciate that, but before we had the word nonbinary it would have been insulting to my trans brothers and sisters for my gender non-confirming (the closest word we had to nonbinary) ass to walk around saying I was trans.

So it’s been difficult for me to understand how you can be nonbinary and also be trans when trans quite literally means to cross or across- the opposite of cis.
Yeah to me too. I just see trans as the opposite to cis and cis is when you vibe with your agab. Anything trans - to me - means not vibing with your agab.
That makes sense, thank you for commenting!
You very succinctly said something that has been talking me paragraphs to try to explain.
Thanks for your perspective!
This is my personal view as well. 

In fact, it’s almost jarring, and feels almost misgendering, to read all of these “trans is the umbrella term and nb falls under that.”  As if just by stating that, someone is trying to tell me what my gender is - that I’m not non-binary, or not solely non-binary, but that I’m trans as well. And I’m not. I have no connection to the term trans. It has nothing to do with internalized transphobia, or external transphobia, or trying to exclude trans people. 

It has to do with, I took a long time on my gender journey, including trying to figure out if trans fit me or not. And it’s just not the right term or definition for me. Non-binary is the right identifier for me. 

I usually see either two different umbrellas, or sometimes three. (And this is what was explained to be for years, prior to joining this community)

Either, the two umbrellas are “Binary” and “Non-binary”, with both binary cis and binary trans under the first umbrella, and all the varieties of non-binary (including agender, bigender, genderfluid, genderqueer, demigender, etc) under the second umbrella. 

Or, I see three umbrellas- Cis, Trans, and Non-binary. I don’t feel / I am not cis. I don’t feel / I am not trans. I am non-binary, currently specifically genderqueer, but possibly other enby terms as well / instead. 

Tbh, this is first time, in online spaces or irl, that I’ve heard so much “trans is the big umbrella that nb fits under”. I’m much more used to “nb is the big umbrella that trans fits under”. In the sense that, anything other than aligning with the AGAB is going outside of the cis gender binary. 

It’s weird. It feels very “othering” for so many comments to assert that all nb are trans. I feel a lot of dysphoria from trying to force myself into a trans box or umbrella that just isn’t the right word for me. Whereas I feel no dysphoria with “non-binary”. 

I totally accept that for some people, the umbrella is trans —> non-binary, and they identify that way. That’s v cool that they know themselves, and know that that’s how they identify. I’m not trying to argue them out of that view. 

But to try to force that onto other people? That doesn’t feel good at all, and feels like someone is trying to force a label onto me. 

I feel like I’m setting myself up to get downvoted here, and/or accused of transphobia. So I legit feel nervous even posting this. All I know, is for me, I am enby and I am not trans.
That just sounds like trying to decide someone's labels for them (isn't that the common thing we're all trying to get away from?). I'm under no obligation to call myself trans because I'm nonbinary.
I've always presented this way, too (unless someone forced me into something else)! I've been working on social changes, but it feels more like getting the world to see what's always been there, rather than transition. Especially considering that the changes I'm making are legal ones.

That's definitely a personal take though, and doesn't apply to everyone.
It can also relate to what transition would look like, as well.
But isn't that all umbrella terms that are not mutually exclusive?

trans -> nonbinary -> agender.

It falls under the umbrellas, doesn't it?

Obviously, I am not telling you what labels you have to use, that is only your decision.
I identify as agender, more specifically apagender. For me it feels like my gender isn't a part of ME. There isn't an absemce of gender. There is something there, I just feel no connection to it and also couldn't tell you what it is. That's also why I've just identified as a man up till recently since it felt to me like the only thing determining/communicatong my gender was my body. I still present masculine and use he/him, but that's just for convenience and experience.

I could magically change genders tomorrow and except for the practical changes and adaptations, I don't see myself feeling any differently than I currently do.
If you don't mind me asking, what is transmasc/ what is the difference between transmasc and trans man?
Happy to help
Trans doesn't exclusively mean ""non-nonbinary,"" don't worry. Some nonbinary people choose not to use it, but technically, it can refer to anyone with a gender identity different from their AGAB, as it always has. You're not misgendering yourself if you choose to use it.
Yeah, as u/AngryAuthor said, trans still includes non-binary as I said as well. For me it also generally comes up when talking to other people in the lgbt community, so it might also from there that I'm separating non-binary from binary-trans.

And probably also that I feel a bit disingenuous when using it, since my experience with gender is very different from the trans people I know. Especially around disphoria and transitioning.

So please, don't feel that you were wrong the usage of those terms because of me.
u/NBnoemi you didn't remind me! Luckily, I happen to remember just now.
Ooh that didn't even cross my mind until now! Thank you so much for making me aware of that.
My state allows you to update your gender marker on your driver's license, and they've gone out of their way to give you cloak and dagger level plausible deniability so that only you know that you're doing so. You tell the clerk you want to ""update your details"" and then you re-enter all your details (address, weight, height, eye color, gender marker) on a little touchscreen. The clerk doesn't see what you entered, or what it was before. Then they take a new picture, you pay a $20 fee and they mail you a new card.

[Edit]Oh, and I almost forgot, my point was that X is one of your options[/Edit]
Woahhh I didn't even consider that possibility, that's wild! Pretty cool.
Just like in my comic! 😍
Damn, that's kind of weird to think about. Although I'm wondering, what would people be that had X assigned at birth, but identify as either male or female.

They would be trans, because of AGAB, but what about the binary/nonbinary? Because currently binary-trans would be people transitioning between male and female, and nonbinary-trans would be from the binary to nonbinary. Would from nonbinary to binary also be nonbinary-trans.

I might have come to a conclusion while typing, but would still love anyone's opinion.
It's funny to me you say that as an agender, because I'm gendervoid and i prefer to be included under the trans label. Because I'm still trying to transfer myself out of my agab (into redaction, but still)
I get this—the trans community has often been exclusive to anyone who isn’t non-non-binary (that is, binary trans). 

Transgender has been used in other ways, however. Leslie Feinberg (the person who wrote *Stone Butch Blues*) was nb and popularized the term transgender back in the 1980s and 1990s.
Not sure why you're getting downvoted, it's the same reasoning for me. Language changes over time, and it can sometimes be hard to apply those changes retroactively. I don't see any issue with defaulting to a term that's easier for the other person to understand; sometimes you just don't want to go into the full explanation.
Sorry it's so long and rambling 😅. I wrote it while listening to a talk and was kind of distracted haha.

Thanks for saying so, though. I know everyone has different experiences and perspectives, and mine will likely differ from yours. But I appreciate you taking the time to read it :) thanks.
Yes. These stereotypes are so harmful, in so many ways. Not just for how cis people see us, and treat us, and legislate against us, but also for how we see ourselves - struggling against those stereotypes, and against the shame and fear they bring.
Ofc 💖
I feel like its a societal thing where stigma has a lot to do with it. If everyone didnt assume you were for example gay, coming out wouldnt be as big of a deal either.

I think the change I made was larger than just my interaction with my family but it did play a role. I have dysphoria for example.

Being nb can mean different things to different people though and I'm ok with that.
Trans isn't short for transition. Transgender does not mean transitioning gender, it just shares the same root word in its etymology. 
No one needs to transition to be trans. 

If a dfab trans guy was raised as a tomboy would he not be trans? 

I'm not telling you to change your identity ofc I just really don't understand this line of reasoning because it just seems like a misunderstanding of the word at its core
Even with that definition, opposite of cis, nb still works though. It seems to me like you mean trans people are ""the opposite gender"" which is a very binary way of looking at things.

I have changed my name, pronouns, wardrobe and appearance. I have also changed the way I interact with others and think about myself. These are things you dont have to do to be trans, but something many trans people do. In the same way many nb people have these experiences. 

I think this all comes from a sense that the barrier of entry is lower for enbies. For trans people there is a long way to go before you pass. The issue here is that there isnt a way for nb people to pass. There isnt a correct way to be nb in our society because it isnt really accepted. It might seem like anyone can just say that they are nb and also trans without changing anything and that might offend you. Thing is that dismissing someone for not passing regardless of if they are nb, mtf or ftm (I know these terms are dated) is kind of something that has its roots in internalized transphobia.
>before we had the word nonbinary it would have been insulting to my trans brothers and sisters for my gender non-confirming (the closest word we had to nonbinary) ass to walk around saying I was trans.

I don't miss the ""you're not really trans unless you do x, y, z just like me"" attitude that was prevalent.
I really don't think this is the case at all. Trans as short for transgender has been a broad inclusive term that included basically all people doing weird stuff for gender my entire time as an out trans person and based on what I've heard from others going back to the nineties? Perhaps this varies from place to place but as far as I know it is/was specifically in opposition to the term with your definition (transsexual which has fallen out of use). Of course both of these can be shortened to trans which may explain contrary associations for that word.
I feel like it’s more Venn diagrams. In fact I made a post a very long time ago to that effect, low quality drawing and all.

Saying that binary contains all cis and trans people would imply that me and other transgender nonbinary people of past and present are not nonbinary because we’d have to be binary to be able to be trans.

It also kinda sets up binary and nonbinary as exclusively opposing things, but there are plenty of people with both nonbinary and binary aspects coexisting in themselves, these people would straddle your proposed umbrellas in yet another different way than I would (since I don’t feel any connection to binary gender).

Beyond all that though, you’re not trans and I am not trying to say that you are. Just noting that at the end because I don’t want to sound like I’m trying to argue against who you are or anything wildly inappropriate like that.
[deleted]
You still present masc and use he/him, so it sounds like possibly you’re not attempting physical or social transition. In that case, I totally understand why you wouldn’t identify as trans. 

I personally see the term as typically describing people who are physically or socially transitioning in some way, even if it’s a really slight change.

Edit to clarify: Of course this wouldn’t mean people who aren’t physically or socially transitioning can’t identify as trans.
Transmasc is an aesthetic or feeling and trans man is a binary gender. A nonbinary person may be transmasc meaning they present masculine or feel masculine. Transman is a binary man
Transitioning to be more masculine vs transitioning to be fully a man
This is honestly how it should be everywhere. My state requires a court appearance and almost a month’s salary (for the average worker) worth of fees. You essentially have to sue the state to allow you to be who you are legally. I’m going through this process now. It’s so backward.
That’s so cool! Can I ask what state(s) are doing that?
Nice!
My opinion is a bit different. Whatever was on my birth certificate, the vast majority of people in my life have never seen it and have decided to assume what I am regardless. Plus, the further majority of these people independently agree with each other. Even though my parents raised me in a very neutral way, everyone else pushed gender on me like I needed to be marinated in the binary.

Unless people get to grow up with the majority of their interactions acknowledging them being nonbinary AND they don’t need to coalition with other trans people to gain the resources they need (like medical transition needs are still there for many even if everyone around them validates their identity), that’s still transgender-ness of having to deal with misgendering due to societal assumptions.
It's interesting how many of us (I'm agender) vary on this. I personally don't refer to myself as trans, because it doesn't feel like it properly reflects my experience. By definition, I am trans, but I'd rather just call myself nonbinary or agender. 

I think part of this has to do with the way a person's disphoria manifests, if they have disphoria. For me, it's mainly social, but there are plenty of nonbinary folks that have pretty narly body disphoria. Since being transgender has such connotations of physical transition (which is a whole different topic), to those of us that don't need much (or potentially anything) in terms of physical change, it can feel like an inaccurate lable.

I think that difference is why it's useful to include nonbinary when talking about non cis identities.
I said “for me” but people use voting with an upvote to mean “i agree” and a downvote to mean “i disagree”.

Language changes and evolves and so do the emotions we have associated with words, if the word trans as an umbrella term becomes the predominant understanding of the word I’m sure my feelings about it will change. But my entire life (including the 5 years I worked in transgender medicine) the term was used exclusively in a binary sense and it would
have been offensive and invalidating for me to apply that label to myself- that was the consensus for many many years. Yeah, i realize I’m a fucking dinosaur talking to people who were born this Century. I only this year learned people are now using it as an umbrella term and I’ve been really struggling to understand and accept this because now I feel like it’s being forced on me, for the second time in my life.
The root isn't just ""transition"" and ""transgender"" means to ""transition gender."" You can go to other online lgbt+ spaces and ""transitioning"" is a common word everyone can use.

You've never heard someone say that?
You understand that the word “cis” means same, as in same gender assigned at birth, so the opposite of that would be the opposite- yes, this is a very binary way of looking at things and what was drilled into me by both the gay and straight community for decades.

Edit: also, I’m not thinking or speaking in terms of presentation or how people look or are perceived, I’m talking about an inner feeling (or absence of feeling) about what your gender is- how someone appears to the outside world or chooses to present is irrelevant to me here. A trans woman or man pre hormone therapy is no less a man or women. Our bodies are vessels that may or may not match up with our internal feeling of gender. I’m exclusively thinking in terms of internal feeling, there is no “barrier for entry” like - wtf? Your gender is your gender is your gender regardless of how the world sees you, fuck that noise.

Edit #2: this is not to dismiss the pain or dysphoria anyone feels when the vessel they were handed does not match. I’m just saying that you are whatever gender you feel you are regardless of how you look or how anyone sees you.
I’m not saying I was a fan, I’ve always tried to be respectful and not invalidate anyone, I’m just tying to explain to people why I’m having a hard time shifting my understanding. 

And this isn’t not directed at you or your response- but I’m getting really frustrated with the downvotes when i am trying to have a discourse to help wrap my head around something I’m struggling with. We’re all Family guys, if you were born this century your frame of reference about this stuff is totally different from mine, try to muster the patience and compassion you wish people who didn’t understand would have with you rather than jumping to judgements. 

Everyone here is fucking valid and words are mostly bullshit anyways.
I see- and how long have you been out as a trans person? 5 years or less? 

Seeing as I was working in a clinic that was one of the only ones providing hormone treatment to transgender individuals at the time (have never used or even considered the term transsexual it’s been out of favor so long) I can say with confidence this was, indeed, the case and several other people on here have agreed with me. I have trained medical professionals all over the country and given talks on hormone therapy for transgender patients using informed consent at conferences and schools, my doctor colleague was is a transgender man who volunteered his time to give more people access to hormones, he was one of my mentors. I personally have prescribed hormones to dozens of transgender patients (the best job I ever had btw). My point is I’ve been in the middle of this community for a long time, long before I had any words to describe my own gender (or lack of). In fact it was hearing transgender men and women speak so firmly about feeling male or female that started me to question myself as I did not understand what on earth “feeling a gender” was like. 

Perhaps the fact that I was primarily surrounded by binary transgender folks due to the nature of my work has some influence. I’m glad for you that your experience was different, but I’m not just making this up.

Edit for a lot more words and context cuz I’m verbose
Personally, I don’t mind labels too much and I think that’s why I like non-binary cuz it perfectly captures how I feel and I’m fine if that’s under the trans umbrella! The only part that really confuses me is people writing “trans means you don’t identify with your AGAB and that’s always been the definition.” But I heard that definition the first time this week! I always assumed it included some sort of physical or mental or societal transition at least and that’s why it was called transgender.

But again I’m new to this community and even though I’ve been lurking in these spaces for a while, I still have a lot to learn! I might have made a wrong assumption because I don’t think I’ve ever been directly told the definition. But non-binary and trans have always been closely connected for a good reason and the most important thing is that the communities look out for each other :)
Oh I don't think there are any people in here arguing that nonbinaries aren't allowed to identify as trans if they want to. The phrasing in your previous comment just sounded very definitive to me.
Yes you got, that's how I think about it too. In regard to my situation of course, everyone can make their own decision on that.
[deleted]
Exacty! Like, in what circumstances is my gender going to be legally relevant? I don't need to prove to a jury that I'm 5'5"" before I can put it on my license, why is my gender so carefully regulated? What do they think the grift is? What could the grift possibly be that I would be defrauding the MVA by putting one letter there instead of another?
My state requires you have bottom surgery before applying to change your gender marker 🙄
I can probably say it's Maryland without doxing myself. The MVA appears to have taken the stance that they don't need proof for your gender any more than they need proof for your height or weight or eye color... not because they don't think people will lie, but because they don't think it matters at all, just like your weight and height and eye color don't matter. Which is in it's own way even more progressive than believing that nobody will lie about their gender (Which, for the record, is not a thing that anybody actually does).
Oregon does too.  We were the first state in the country that offered it.
Personally, I don't miss the ultra gatekeepy attitude of who was included in trans last century. If you didn't match the binary stereotype close enough, basically get told you don't belong as cis or trans.
It’s very interesting to me because the word trans has become used *more often* for binary people alone in my experience over the last decade, not less. It used to be used in a very open way around me and that was a strong foundation for me to feel that transgender is a thing I am. It was heavily enforced that no one needed to transition across, through, beyond, from, around, whatever gender to another gender, but that we all shared the experience of not being well defined by the gender that was presumed of us (then or in the past). Cisgender was only coined as the alternative, people whose bodies and presumed genders and actual genders all aligned. And now I see more nonbinary people think that trans excludes them due to this or that reason.

Still, I am happy that some people decide to decline existing in the cis-trans dichotomy. Less rules, less enforcement of labeling others without their say so.
wait this confuses me - I always thought it was the other way around: that transgender was the umbrella term. I've found it's only more recently that it's come to mean mostly trans women/men?
That is not correct. Transgender and transition just share the same root word of ""trans"". 
Just because it's common doesn't mean it's correct. Trans is a latin word meaning across from or on the other side. It isn't short for transition. 

And implying that transition is required to be trans has a lot of truscum implications for both binary and nonbinary folks.
Basically i never ""transitioned"" because there was nothing to transition to, i already existed as is. There isnt technically a way to be perfectly nonbinary so in my mind i already was nonbinary since the beginning.
I mean.. in that case, yes, it is about definitions changing. Not much more to say. If you dont learn it there will be a lot of misunderstandings
Fwiw, I've been an adult all of this century. I understand the difficulty when terms you're used to develop a new common usage.
No considerably longer and I find your whole comment kind of patronizing. I've been out for a decade (though originally as a binary trans person), the older people I spoke to 30 years. These people are largely binary trans folk. Several people here have also agreed with me. Transgender was categorically the inclusive option in these communities in my country until relatively recently. I'm genuinely shocked you could be this confidently wrong. Perhaps existing in a primarily medical context gave you an overly narrow view? 

Edit: We don't have informed consent in my country so I imagine we are not from the same place though which might contribute to our differing exsperience.
Since transsexual and transvestite were the first common words for us in recent western history, there has been a strong implication that people who aren’t the gender society assigned must undergo medical and social changes to meet some yardstick amount of “transition” in order to be real and (very marginally) acceptable. Medical professional pathologized something that happens naturally in humans. We’ve slowly taken our labels and identity back from the medical establishment and moved towards self identification over diagnosis.

People like me who don’t want surgery because nothing will make my body feel more correct the way my brain is configured couldn’t be called transsexual in say, the 1960s, couldn’t get certain kinds of support. Maybe I would have been called a transvestite. Maybe my orientation would be blamed as the root of my “disorder” and gender never strongly considered. But there were community made groups of trans and bisexual people that certainly could have recognized me as my nonbinary self, even if we used different words. It just would have been much harder for me to find the words and the radical people who would have been my community.

As language evolves, many people will come to a conversation with different definitions. My definition of transgender is formed on the basis of knowing our history and knowing that we took back ownership of what we’re called from doctors who gatekept who was allowed to be what. So that leads me to a very inclusive definition. There are trans people out there who would come to a conversation with your definition because they intentionally feel that there needs to be limits and restrictions on who is *allowed* to be trans. And still more people can use the definitions that I use or that these hypothetical others use without the political reasoning behind their definition but simply because that’s what they learned.

All to say that I have strong biases, ones which I have a incentive to promote. I’m not blind that I have a message I want others to listen to and to agree to if they find it compelling.
I do agree with you on the etymological origin of trans, and I have argued it as well, but language also changes. 

Although if we want to stay with the arguments based on language. If you're planning to take hormones to look more genderneutral, you would go from a gendered state to an ungendered/genderneutral state, which would be transitioning by definition.

Please take that second part in jest. I'm happy you found yourself and are taking action to become the best you, you can become.
While you don’t have to identify as trans, know that by definition, taking hormones is a form of transitioning
In my state, the rationale is: because Mormon Jesus says gender can’t change and is just genitals at birth. Seriously. This state is a borderline theocracy.
Wow, that's awful. It must be one of the Deep South states, I'd imagine. 

Also, in their mind, what bottom surgery is supposed to turn someone non-binary?! This is basically a way to prevent us from legally transitioning at all.
That’s awesome! I hope more states adopt this practice
I love this. It almost makes me want to move to Maryland—but the lack of mountains and oppressive summer humidity keep me away!
Oregon is pretty chill about this as well. Dunno if the DMV person enters it in or not tho.
Yeah this is the impression I got and it's been really weird even in my life as an out trans person seeing transgender go from broad inclusive category to trans men/women. I was speaking to an  older trans person recently who found it genuinely odd that this word word they thought of as a broader more inclusive alternative to transsexual had come to, in their eyes, mean the same thing.
Just curious if your experiences were online or irl? Because i am relatively new (4 years) to the online queer community but lived in San Francisco and was very active in the community irl from 2000 until 3 months ago. I also worked in a clinic that was one of the first to use the informed consent model for hormone therapy for 15 years.
I am a year late to this party, but I just wanted to say that I’ve been out as queer for a decade and this has been my *exact* experience.
Well hop on board and be confused right along with me fellow traveler- i kind of give up. All i know is, right now, trans doesn’t feel right for me. I’m fully aware that might change and I’m fine with that, but this discourse has helped me feel less emotional about the topic which means mission accomplished.
Transitioning has nothing to do with being trans. You can be trans and not transition. Technically that's me, since i didnt transition but i am still nonbinary which others would call trans. I just dont consider *myself* as trans. So if im truscum then i guess its only against myself. I didnt really imply that transition is necessary to be trans except for myself. So if you do want to ""educate"" someone, maybe choose someone else who is actually hateful against others.

I didn't say that someone needs to transition to be trans. I understand the difference between etymologies. I was just using the term transition as an overhead for my internal feelings and external presentation meaning because i was always nonbinary. I didn't necessarily need to feel like i am trans because i just exist, i dont need to label myself to be comfortable.

I dont know if youre the person that sent me a concerned reddit support, but if you were, why?
Well currently there are a lot of misunderstandings because the majority of us old folks not on the internet and especially outside of the queer community aren’t up to speed with this definition - trust me when i say if i walked around calling myself trans i would have to spend a lot of time clarifying that no, that doesn’t mean I’m male. Nobody gets confused in that way if i say nonbinary. It’s still a minority using the word trans in not in a binary way. 

But don’t worry, I’m a dinosaur- and I’m sure I’m the last generation of queers that is working with the i guess old definition. I knew this day would come- it will come for you one day too. It’s the official marker of me being old and out of touch. FML.
Thanks for being chill about my struggle here
Thank you so much for providing that insight into the recent history of the trans community! I didn’t even think about historical context (which sounds silly now) but that will definitely be something I look into more! I appreciate you sharing with me :)

I've heard it said that the reason conservatives are so angry about trans rights is that because they can't understand what gender dysphoria feels like, they don't believe it. They think we have to be lying about our reason for wanting to be addressed differently. They think that it's just some kind of con, and they try to figure out what the grift is, and either they come up with something horrible or worse, they can't come up with anything so they think it must be something so /incredibly/ horrible they can't even imagine it.
Yeah you can even get X as a gender marker here. It's only M or F. I can't wait until I can move!! Also it's Idaho. Not south but still conservative
I mean, it's not like anybody goes anywhere anymore. The furthest I've been in... weeks is the grocery store. I could be anywhere in the country, I couldn't tell the difference.
There are mountains in western Maryland.
Yes, exactly!! It feels like some people want to put the medical establishment gatekeeping back into transgender.
I have been in online and in person groups and had trans friends in both those spaces for just over a decade.

I would say that my in person groups have always been very welcoming of nonbinary identity, but I self curated and was often the first out person in those groups anyway so that influenced it. Online I’ve gone from communities in the early 2010s where most trans people I knew online were nonbinary (genderqueer) or had explored it as an option to now where it feels like many trans places I poke my head into have core community members who would prefer to gatekeep me out.
fair, for what it's worth I'm not from the USA which might explain the difference.
I don’t have a gender either. I Identify as genderless and don’t even like using the labels of agender or non binary to describe me because it feels too limited. However the trans label makes sense because of my journey. 

You don’t have to have dysphoria to be trans. If you want to start HRT just for the sake of doing it that is cool, but your body will undergo transformations into that “aesthetic” that you’re trying to achieve. 

Again, you don’t have to use the label, but in terms of definition it’s just what it is.
As a centrist-conservative (and an enby), I think you're spot on here. They simply don't understand, and see it as some kind of leftist fad. I kind of see it as my activism to let them know that we are real, that we are just as human as they are, and that we don't all think alike (""leftist zealots"" as they would say). 

I think all bigotry comes from a lack of understanding of another's perspective, to be honest.
No way! I live just south of Malad (but on the Utah side of the border). Isn’t Idaho “great?”
I still travel, and have since being fully vaccinated. But I get that a lot of people feel safer to hunker down, which is valid.
Ooh I didn’t know that!
Self-curated- thats a mood and a great way of describing my experience as well. Can I ask when this was happening for you? For me m transgender in the binary sense started to become much more known, accepted and access to hormones started to increase rapidly in the early 2000’s. Not long after I side-stepped the pressure and expectation to transition I began to describe myself as genderless-then i fell into an 8 year lesbian relationship cave and lost touch with the community. When I emerged in 2015 I learned I was nonbinary! But I was definitely the first person (and only) amongst my queer and hetero peers talking about gender in anything other than binary terms.

All the ridiculously conservative parts of Oregon want to secede from our state to join Idaho ... It's a super conservative state. In some ways more so than the deep south. You don't even have individual cities in Idaho that are liberal or diverse. It's all conservative white folks.
Is less that and more that now that I telework I don't really have a reason to. I actually take 15 minute grass-touching breaks throughout my work day to keep from turning into a shut-in.

It feels more like PA imo. Beautiful though for sure.
I “discovered” trans people were real in 2009, found online groups to question my orientation and gender in immediately, and came out to myself in 2010 as being genderqueer. From then on I was openly nonbinary on my (rural, southern) college campus which led to me finding other people at college who were closeted but had something going on under wraps. Eventually many of them came out there, or I’ve kept up with them on Facebook where they’re now using the names and pronouns that match their gender.

In both my online and in person groups from 2010-2014, nonbinary trans people were prevalent, probably roughly equal to the number of binary trans people. After that I also went into a cave of sorts, had no safe way to stay in touch or express my transgender self (except in secret talking to my wife and with this one nonbinary person I met in this truly unsafe town). A few years later, I couldn’t handle it anymore and I moved away and came to a large urban center where I’ve re-integrated online and in person. My new groups I’m involved in offline are for trans people and explicitly include me, not so much organic friends coming together but more community center based support/activity groups.
A lot of non binary people use the term trans to describe themselves and they do not have a gender. People use hormone therapy or do body and social adjustments to feel comfortable within themselves. It’s not always about achieving a “gendered” look or feeling. It’s about maintaining comfortable and just being able to feel fully like yourself. 

What I’m explaining is essentially the label of trans can be seen as being just as wide as the non binary label as they are both umbrella terms and everyone’s experience falls along a spectrum under here. 

You keep saying you don’t use the label to describe yourself and that’s not a problem. I’m just making sure that the existence of the trans label isn’t seen as something as limited or binary when it simply isn’t.
Nice! Looks like an excellent place for an adventure :)."	qwmdp5	NonBinary	442	0.98	2021-11-18 09:49:59
So, I just got thrown out of my parents Christmas party.	"Edit: CW: Transphobia, Deadnaming

Tbh, I don't really know why I am posting here, I just have to vent I guess.
Some background: I'm a 37yo trans-femme enby and  discovered that fact about 2 years ago. I talked to my parents and they seemed very accepting but I didn't have much direct contact with them, due to covid.
For Christmas I usually just visit for a few hours and go home the same day, cause the Christmas stuff really tires me and my mental health hasn't been the best the last years. This time, I thought I could spend the night because the last year's went pretty good.
Everything was okay, got deadnamed a few times, but that stuff happens, especially if you know someone your whole life under another name.
Now I don't really care about pronouns in my nativ language (German), because I haven't found a neutral one I like, but I really don't like being called a man or any other male nouns.
So this morning my niece (I haven't met her yet, due to covid again) asked who I am, and my mother told her: ""this is [dead name], he's your uncle, he's my son."" and that just tipped me over.
I waited till the kids were gone and told her that I was  hurt and dissapointed she didn't even try. She ignored me and just went on.
A little bit later I tried to talk to her about it, but she just said she doesn't have to change for me and that I make this all about me (duh, it's my identity).
Finally my father joint in, telling me I ruined Christmas for them and, after I asked them why they can't except that I'm not a man, yelled at me that I am his son and I should leave.
I'm now riding the train to my hometown, after my very accepting Sister brought me to the train station.
That's Christmas for me, I guess, but tbh, the magic has been gone for years now.
I will definitely go no contact for at least a while.
I hope you all have a better Christmas than I do and hope the next year will be full of love for ya'll."	"*Hugs* for you sweetie. Spend some time recovering, and thank your sister for us.
I'm sorry that happened. And funnily enough your parents made it about them. I once read an analogy about changing your last name when you get married and that transphobes have no problem with that. But since you're also talking about your relation to your mother, I think I have a better analogy.

When you have a partner, let's say for the example they're a woman. First she is your girlfriend, then your fiance and then your wife. If your mother than says after your marriage that she is your girlfriend, I can imagine you saying something as well. In this situation no one would try to argue you're making it about yourself/your wife.

Just like the analogy, you parents don't give you the least amount of respect. Only because they can't accept who you are, that's them making it about themselves. They're taking active actions to hurt you.

I hope you find more people like your sister. And I hope you can find a family that you can share festivities with, without this negativity.
I'm so sorry this happened.  Your sister sounds like an angel.
Your 37, time to enjoy the niece with their family, and enjoy time with people that are not looking at a full grown adult and saying that what they are doing for their happiness that hurts no one is wrong.
Your parents are being downright horrible to you. Refusing to show you respect and trying to control who you are, especially at this age!, is textbook abusive parent behavior. (I happen to be the same age as you and also figured myself out at 35 :) And I have a little too much experience with dealing with abusive patents/other family members. On that note I must recommend the sub r/raisedbynarcissists. They're well modded, lgbtqia+ friendly, and many there will relate to what you've been through, even the cis members; they may not have had your exact experience,  but almost everyone there has dealt with the same kind of controlling hostility and tantrumy behavior from their parents over all kinds of other things.)

I suggest you consider reducing or eliminating future contact and visits with them, for the sake of your mental and emotional well-being. It was their responsibility as your parents to support you, including emotionally. Trying instead to force you to be something they want you to be, without regard for causing you harm to get what they want, is close to polar opposite of healthy parenting. You don't owe them a damn thing. They owed you so much already, and now they also owe you nothing less than a massive and sincere apology, especially if they want your time or energy again for any reason. Anything less than that is basically a promise that they will treat you just as badly or worse if you resume regular contact or visit them again.

You didn't do anything wrong.

Your parents failed you. Not the other way around.

You deserve so much better. F* them, if you don't mind me saying so.
So sorry you had to go through this. I kinda relate. I have no contact with my parents for almost 3 years now because they basically stopped recognizing me as their daughter after divorcing and entering a relationship with my current mtf partner. My mother texted me a bunch of slurs addressed to all of us (me, my ex and my current partner), refused to visit me ever again and moved to another city without telling me anything about it. My father (after me calling him on his birthday) accused me of never visiting them in the context in which I was never invited at their place nor do I know where they live anymore. I have a 6yo daughter which they never call or visit. All this comes after a childhood and adolescence of emotional and physical abuse from my father which my mother never stopped or addressed. It used to be a very difficult topic for me, however with therapy and a lot of work I have come to understand that I need to learn to be my own parent and accept the fact that these people who are my biological relatives never learned or made any effort to be my real parents. It's a tough lesson and I am still processing it, however it gets somehow easier to manage day by day. The most difficult cookie to swallow is the fact that I never really felt loved and/or accepted unconditionally. I am still working on this. You need to focus on yourself and try as much as you can to find this comfort inside you first and foremost. You need to love yourself and accept yourself and look inside yourself to find the power to be your own parent. It takes time and work and it will not happen overnight, but it is doable. Leaning on my partner, therapy, reaching out to online communities, all these helped me. Good luck to you! 💜
that's awful hon, I hope you're ok
I'm sorry that happen to you, your sister seems great. Hope you'll have a better new year, virtual hugs for you :)
We are not out yet, but I'm part of an OSDD-1B system (medically diagnosed) and our host disappeared because the people that caused our trauma are here and they didn't feel safe, and I was basically told to go in another room and I feel like no one likes me. Christmases are tough. Sorry you're having a rough one too.
Oh, love, my heart is breaking for you, but I'm glad you came on here to share your story. I'm in a similar boat with my parents seemingly on board and then not and then maybe back on but then no, not. All of which is all compounded when you feel like your brain is struggling with it's own health. It's a painful situation to be in and you don't deserve a second of it, not one single second. You deserve an expansive and beautiful family and I hope that in the coming years you get all that and more. But for now, stay safe, be well in whatever way that means for you, and know that while we are strangers a host of people across the world are loving you and wishing you the absolute best.
Tut mir sehr leid, dass du das erleben musstest. 
Du hast einen mutigen und gesunden Schritt gewagt, deine echte Identität auszuleben und deiner Eltern sind (noch) nicht bereit, diese anzuerkennen. 
Deine Schwester klingt aber super lieb! 
Ganz liebe Wünsche and dich 🎄♥️
Sigh.  That is so discouraging.  On the plus side, your sister.  Stay strong.
I will never understand family that chooses to close their minds and be hard nosed about change rather than continue relationships with the people they supposedly love.

Like did they ever love you at all? Or only the idea of you?
Sending you much love and solidarity. <3
Es tut mir sehr leid. 😔
All the hugs for you <3 I hope you find some more accepting folks to spend newyears with.
I'm no contact with mine. My life blossomed in a way I never could imagine. If it's time for you, it's time. 

I hope you're ok. You will be ok.
i’m so sorry that happened! that does seem so unnecessarily cruel of them. I wish people could be more accepting, especially those who claim to love us. I hope you have a better rest of your day and remember that i’m rooting for you:)
I'm sorry that happened to you. (Hugs)
Im so srry their ur pronouns and ur gender٫ they should exept that hope u have a better Christmas next year virtual hugs from me!
Christmas is such a bummer. Sorry it came to a painful head, but perhaps it is best. You cannot change or detoxify others but only separate and insure YOUR boundaries. 

My parents threw my wife and me out at Christmas for reason(s) I still am not aware of and can only speculate about. 

I divorced them. It was years later after my father had passed away that I made contact with my mother again on a very limited basis. My terms. 

Lost faith in Christmas about the age I realized it wasn't about what they said it was. Not the whole Santa Claus thing, the interpersonal thing. The guts of it. Bullshit made to make you feel miserable. Being trans is just a catalyst in the mix. Be thankful you KNOW that.

Hope the new year goes well for you and those who truly love and accept you!
Typically family selfishness 🙄. I'm glad your sister at least is accepting and got you out of there.

 This is the first Xmas I'm spending with my chosen fam instead of my fam fam, so excited. I had a video call with thr fam though like machine guns of misgendering what a fucking mess but it's over and I'm so excited to visit friends.
I’m so sorry that happened to you. I’ve been kind of having the same thing happen today.

I do hope you get to enjoy the rest of the night. 

Happy Holidays my friend :)
A thousand hugs are on their way 💛. Welcome to the ruined Christmas squad ( although the reason is different ) !
Sending you all the virtual hugs I can!!
Das tut mir sehr leid. Mir passiert das ich sehr häufig, dass meine Eltern betonen, dass ich so eine hübsche junge Frau sei bzw. so eine hübsche Tochter. Sie versuchen nicht, sich mir anzupassen. Es tut weh, aber irgendwann muss ich nicht mehr unter ihrem Dach wohnen. Deine Eltern sollten dich mehr respektieren. Du bist 37 und sie behandeln dich wie ein Kleinkind dass ihnen grad auf die Nerven geht. Es kann nicht sein, dass deine Identität ihr Weihnachten ruiniert hat. Sie haben es für sich selbst ruiniert. Ich hoffe, dass du trotzdem irgendwie ein schönes Weihnachten feiern kannst, und ich wünsche dir alles gute
I’m so sorry this happened to you, especially on Christmas. I hate it when people do that. That your parents try to claim you’re making it all about you. And then they proceed to claim you’ve “ruined their Christmas”? Honey if that’s not making something all about you Idk what is
I'm sending you virtual hugs! 💜 

I'm sorry that your family is so disrespectful and self-absorbed, and that they're sharing those traits with your young niece. You aren't asking for anything unreasonable - Just acknowledgement and respect for your identity and name. 

I appreciate you. Stay strong!
It's been a similar experience here. I have considered whether or not I'll contact my parents on future Christmases. Unsure yet. I may send a postcard with ""your son is dead"", or I might send a Christmas card with a nice photo of me and ""You can meet me, [real name], this Christmas - if you are nice & not naughty!""
I just want to say I’m so sorry to what happened to you.
Thank you so much 💕 I did thank my sister.
Thank you 💕
Yeah, they made it about themselves, but I don't think they even notice. They seem to think their view of the world is the ""normal"" one.
I knew the analogy with the changed last name, but yours may be a little more understandable. If I resume contact I'll try it that way.
Thankfully I have a lot of understanding and supportive people around me. 💜
Thank you 💕 She really is, and all this while she herself is struggling with a divorce at the moment. I'm really happy to have her.
Yeah, I'll go zero contact with them for now, we'll see what the future holds.
Yeah I'm 31 and probably never going to come out to them at all for this reason. Been no/low contact for a  few years and its been the best move for my mental health.
Thank you very much for your words. 💕
I know that subreddit, the thing is my parents do have problems with supporting me emotionally but otherwise they have been pretty supportive, especially my mother, and we had a respectful relationship up until now.
I don't really know what got into them and I feel really betrayed right now, especially because my mother assured me I could be myself beforehand. This was the first time in years I was looking forward to visit them.
Thank you so much 💜
I'm so sorry you had to go through all that and I'm happy you are getting better. 💕
I'm already looking for therapy and I'm looking into some online communitys.
I'm okay and back at my place now, thanks. 💕❤️
Thank you, very kind ❤️ I hope you have a great new year, too!
Awww, thank you. 💜
I'm still NC, still struggling a little bit, but it has gotten better 🙂
>>They seem to think their view of the world is the “normal” one 

That’s exactly what it is. Using someone’s assigned name and pronouns is considered the norm, and therefore anything that deviates from that is seen as a favor people have to go out of their way to do for you rather than just the correct thing to do.
Enjoy the other relatives if you’d like, and you can give them nice memories that are not tainted by the others
Ok good
I’m sorry but what is NC?
Thanks, I will 💕
No contact
Ah, understood. I am sorry"	roa23z	NonBinary	439	1.0	2021-12-25 13:44:31
Is there any validity to this? To me it seems like a chronically online take but I am white so maybe I’m missing something.		"There was a good discussion about this recently [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/wmwtew/you_cant_be_white_and_nonbinary/).

TL;DR: This is stupid.
as a black enby i don’t get it at all. like i’ve heard the discussion and maybe i’m too dumb to understand it, but like just because a culture created the gender binary doesn’t mean members of it can’t deviate from that. i honestly might just be stupid though
No validity whatsoever. 100% a chronically online take.

Now if they'd said ""two-spirit"" instead of ""nonbinary"", okay. That's an exclusively indigenous identity.

But anyone of any race can be nonbinary. This racial gatekeeping is 100% in bad faith.
I'm a white enby and thought it was stupid so I brought it up to my black enby gf and they also thought it was stupid. So I think it's probably stupid.
Is not only a terminally online take, but also (as most if not all terminally online ones) extremely stupid, gatekeepy, and asshole take.
I know some enby identities are very much tied to certain cultures, like, the idea of ""two spirit"" and all. But there are plenty of enby identities and there is no way a white person needs to be stuck with cultural norms just because their ancestors were. Culture is always changing, no one needs to be limited by tradition. 

Being honest, is an absolute necessity to question tradition and culture, ""mainstream"", ""dominant"" culture most of all. I can't see any kind of benefit in gatekeeping and shaming white people that question the system they were born in.

I know there are some white ""allies"" and white LGBT folks that need to understand better how racism is linked to other forms of bigotry and you can't discuss gender without discussing socioeconomic and racial inequality, and some people wanting to exclude white allies is predictable due to frustration and everything, but it's kinda counterproductive and won't change the fact that gender non conformity is not exclusive to certain groups.
I'd be willing to have a conversation about White supremacy and the way it uses the gender binary to enforce it's prevalence, but I won't entertain the idea that white people can't be nonbinary lol that's ridiculous.
no this is stupid
Honestly I've only heard of that being a thing with young people on tiktok. A couple people have mentioned it on reddit and people were confused lol. It doesn't make sense
There are situations in cultures where nonbinary genders exist, but it's not a culture thing itself. This is just gatekeeping
Funny, because as a Black person, I've heard the opposite: that being non-binary is a white thing, and I've had Black women berate me for not being proud of my roots as a Queen, mother (yuck, no!), and all other things that Black women should be. 
Hell, I can be non-binary royalty without listening to that hotep shit!
Non-Binary, as an idea, does not belong to any one specific group of people. Now specific Non-Binary labels, such as Two-Spirit, are definitely not white people things. I think Non-Binary genders have historically been found in non-white parts of the world, but it's an awful gatekeeping tactic that invalidates an identity that many white people feel aligned with. So long as you're respectful, not appropriating gender identities from cultures that don't claim you, there's no reason a white person can't be Non-Binary.
""Terminally online""
I hope content creator can feel the disappointed Jewish stare all the way from here.
what?? i thought being non-binary had nothing to do with race
As a black
Nonbinary adult wtf is this 😂
What I understood from most of that discussion that if we as white people are going to opt out of the gender binary, we also need to be doing our part to change the fact that the gender binary has been used to oppress black and brown people more. Not just a “no white people should be non-binary” but more “non-binary white people need to be actively anti-racist”
It's funny... just the other day I saw a PoC making the exact OPPOSITE argument. That nonbinary is a white ONLY term because it came from whites and that PoCs aren't/can't be/shouldn't be nonbinary, that they should identify with the indigenous terms from their culture(s) only, because nb is white.

So, uh, take that as you will.
Ah yes because white people started the gender binary that means every person who is born white supports the binary and can’t be non binary. Makes sense /s 
Seriously what the fuck, that is incredibly invalidating and puts race into an issue that it really doesn’t play that a big a part in.
Nonbinary is purposefully incredibly broad. It means anyone who is not always, completely, and exclusively a man OR a woman. How could you possibly gatekeep that? Are they saying that all white people are binary? That doesn't make sense. That would be like saying all white people are cis or straight.
Some identities are exclusive to certain cultures and religions, but you can't come in, years after a term has been created, a start trying to exclude people from it. That's lesbian separatist crap.
Non-binary genders have existed in many cultures for a long time. I’m a white (mixed with indigenous) person and identify as two-spirit, the Native American equivalent to non-binary and transgender. But I guess cuz I’m white skinned my culture doesn’t matter anymore.
This is exactly why I'm not on TikTok and will choose single-player videogames over social media every time.
It's bs
POC enby, confirmed stupid. Is your identity unique to a culture you're not part of? no? then fuck the hell off and let people identify! It's ""xenogenders are the reason nonbinary people aren't taken seriously"", except racist
It’s fucking bs. Tiktolk= Fox News
Welp then *turns to dust*
I haven't actually seen any of the videos about this, just the discussion. But it honestly seems like bait to me. There's no way this is a real opinion someone has
It's dumb as fuck and doesn't make since.
No, and it’s harmful…
I recently wrote this on a similar post, hope it helps:

You gotta go easier on yourself my friend. Yes the gender binary is deeply rooted in western colonial thinking and a European scientific worldview that sutured gender & genitals together — but the export of this idea rolled over and attempted to erase the existence of every non-binary person—black, white, Indigenous… Just because your ancestors are settlers and may have subscribed to the same colonial worldview, doesn’t mean you don’t have a right get to exist as the person you are. 

Speaking your existence out loud is breaking a cycle that wanted you erased. Anyone trying to perpetuate that erasure is picking up the same colonial tools and causing further harm.
Someone is off on their gender terms vs racial terms.
This is horseshit.

That’s it, that’s my comment.
People need to touch grass.
How would being white make you binary? There are terms about certain non-binary genders that don’t apply to white people (like two-spirit, for example, because it has a specific history for indigenous people), but non-binary just means not one of the two binary options so this is definitely wrong. I do agree that someone trying to dismantle the gender binary, the patriarchy, compulsory heterosexuality, etc. also needs to be working on dismantling racism, anti-blackness, colonialism, etc. as well. Don’t see how gatekeeping non-binary identities from white people would help with any of that.
It’s stupid and invalidating. I hate seeing it brought up
When on tiktok, you’ll find plenty of chronically online takes like this.
9500 likes for this gatekeeping bullshit? What difference is there between those who say “I identify as a helicopter” and this person? Jeez
Um what? I'm confused. Non binary is a modernized version of genderqueer which dates back to 1980s, meaning it's fairly recent. We're talking white af United States here. Pretty sure ""non binary"" isn't tied to culture, ethnicity, or race.
People outside the gender binary have existed for a long time in all areas of the world. There’s been recent evidence of potentially non-binary gender identity in ancient times in the Scandinavian region, for example. So while I think it’s inappropriate for white people to adopt terms like two-spirit and Mahu, it’s definitely not the case that “white” people can’t be non-binary.
That is the dumbest take ever. I wish chronically online people would just go outside and think for themselves
No. White people can be non-binary.
Non-binary is a gender, white in this case, is a skin color.
What…..
No. Just no.
I saw some things about how it was white people who created the gender binary, and while yes white people have tried their best to erase any culture that has other beliefs on gender that doesn’t mean only white people have a gender binary. Like, don’t a lot of other cultures have binaries like the middle east and east asia? I just don’t think you can say a whole group of people can’t be that gender because it also suggests that there’s like a biological difference between Cultures that people are raised in because gender is inherent.
That's like one of the worst takes one could find.
I love reading stupid hateful shit like this.
This is the shit cowards and imbeciles say online behind a screen but would never have the balls to say irl. Keyboard warriors and bigots.
Nope.
lmao that’s nonsense
Sounds pretty racist. What were they trying to say?
My only guesses are something about the preexistence of two-spirit identities (etc.) amongst p.o.c, or that because there's a cultural difference between black and white Americans concerning hypermasculisation and more rigidly proscribed femininity/artifical, hegemonic femininity being better suited to white people (Tech there's a diff between most black & white ppl, but I'd hope that they would at least have the sense to not attribute that to anything other than social conservatism in that context. It's not strictly divided along racial lines. Although Americans tend to only view race through their own lense, as if it's the default so prob) that white men/males & women/females can already / more easily subvert gender norms w/o the need to ""appropriate"" non-binary identities...
I use nonbinary because Two Spirit is indigenous and I don't want to step on anyone's toes. Nonbinary is universal. NB is non-black. Enby is the short form of nonbinary that does not step on racial toes.
No, it's ridiculous
Social media platforms like TikTok have algorithms that show you content that will make you angry/upset, as they've found that's what drives the most engagement.  People take advantage of the algorithm by posting ridiculous takes with the goal of basically starting as much argument as possible.  It's not a reasonable take
Well that just flat out isn't true. I would ignore this.
Legit the right are constantly injecting non-issue discourse into lgbt communities to keep us divided, I assure you if you could track this backwards you would find a right wing chud at the end of the trail.
The way I see it, it’s like: your group of people likes roses and developed a superiority complex due to it, and now roses are the standard, but you, despite being related to this group, actually far prefer carnations. This doesn’t mean that you’re wrong, it just means that you like carnations.
There is not.
Uh yeah no you can be white and non-binary lmfao
I feel like when we're looking at the term nonbinary, it means nonconforming to either of two options. I'm white as well, came out nonbinary over a year ago and now identify as a trans guy, but I feel like race has nothing to do with it. the term is used as a form of gender identity. I think if anyone is saying certain races can't use that term, it's leaning towards that person feeling the need to have something that's ""theirs"" but you can't gatekeep someone's identity.
edit: im no expert and this isn't me stating I think I'm right bc I can definitely be wrong. that's just my take.
Very much chronically online take
I thought the take was a shitpost 💀
The argument that I've seen is that white people invented and enforce the binary; therefore, they can't exist outside of the binary.  The evidence - everything before the semi-colon - doesn't support the conclusion.  You would need at least one more sentence to explain why having invented and enforced a binary on a collective basis means that one could not exist outside the binary.  In truth you'd need a whole lot more than one sentence because you're going to have to hope to bamboozle someone with a bunch of smart-sounding nonsense for the statement to make any sense at all.

Of course, that first sentence is also rather patently absurd.  By that I mean that we have around five thousand years of recorded history.  That oldest known history at the moment is from a region that today comprises parts of countries such as Iraq and Syria.  While we only have scraps of information, there is nothing to suggest that they did anything particularly crazy when it came to gender identity.  That is to say that they, like every other civilization in recorded history, operated under the assumption that *most* or *all* people fell in the binary.  And you might note that the people who live in that region today are rather decisively *not* white!

So if the oldest recorded history we have comes from non-white people and if that same history fails to support even the most basic premise that the concept was invented by white people, what else is there?  Why not look into the other necessary supposition:  that white civilizations lacked any concept of nonbinary people?  If you were to do so, you don't  have to look very hard to find that...white civilizations often developed the concept.  Take the Greeks, for example.  These are the people often pointed to as the forbearers of modern western civilization.  They developed a pantheonic religion with a god dedicated to Wine, another to fertility, another to war.  Anything that the Greeks could conceive of seemed to have a god associated with it.  And one of those gods is Hermaphroditos who lent their name to the word hermaphrodite.  We'd call such a person *intersex* these days, but I digress.  The god is described as a mortal male who fell in love with a nymph named Salmacis.  Fearing that they would be separated at some point, the nymph prayed to the gods for a boon that would prevent this, and so those Gods merged the two.  Hermaphroditos was thus *nonbinary* in the most fundamental sense as they were a literal merging of male and female!  And not only are they (note that the Greeks would have used *him* because their civilization was *absolutely* a patriarchy) nonbinary, they also happen to be the god of transfemmes since they have a spring that feminizes any male who bathes in its waters.

Finally people are just *people*.  The human condition is universal.  That fact is why you can read a story from a thousand years ago and identify with the people in it.  A lot of surface details change with time, but concepts that run as deep as identity - things that are literally fundamental to the human condition - don't.  Just because a people did not have words for something related to identity (you often see people argue that so and so wasn't gay because the concept of gay didn't exist at the time and place, so in spite of doing things that would be unambiguously gay these days, they couldn't possibly have thought of themselves as gay and therefore couldn't have *been* gay), or didn't think something related to identity was important enough to write down (the further back you go, the harder it was to write things down and preserve them and so the records increasingly trend toward really big picture stuff such as laws or religion, or really important stuff like who paid what in taxes) is no reason to suppose that the identity didn't exist.

So there you have it.  The argument doesn't make sense because the argument does not support its own conclusion in a strictly logical sense.  The two premises made by the argument - that the binary was invented by white people and that non-white people were the inventors and exclusive users of the concept of being outside of the binary until recently - are trivially proven false.  Finally the basic assumption that one would have to make just to support those two premises is that white and non-white people are *different* in some fundamental way is not true regardless of how we look at it.
I am so tired of seeing this shit here. Obviously it's just shit stirrers. Just think about what non binary means for a second: It means NOT in the BINARY. Anyone can be non binary if they don't vibe with the binary genders.
There’s *actual* issues out here with racial inequality in the lgbtq+ community, cmon y’all.. use your platform for something smart 😩 @OP
It's stupid and evil, but people are stupid and evil IRL too, so I don't think it's ""chronically online"" exactly.
You're not unique enough.
You can't be white if you're white because white people invented racism... Ya it's that level of dumb.
I think I recall that it was supposed to be a clickbait-y caption for a good point (breaking the gender binary requires going against white supremacy). Say what you want about the statement and how it was used, that's just some background.
As an Asian, what?

It's just your gender why is race involved? You're alright

Edit: ok so I have context now and my answer is still ""what?""

Edit 2: oh I forgot I already heard about this before

Yeah don't worry about it you're fine
I hope that is a starting point for those people to evolve and change and research ( hopefully with good sources) if they stand by that.... Wow
All things aside: by no person, no matter the colour, socio-economic status, place in hierarchy am i going to be told *my* gender identity. And i don't believe any sensible person here thinks that.
White people created the western concept of gender binary we can destroy the gender binary!
Naw ur not missing anything, this is just plain old ✨racism✨
Bruh what?
bro what is this
Racist and bigoted stupidity.
Okay but like.. The ancient norse? Literally had a job that loosely translates to battle priests that was exclusively for enbys. And iirc they weren't many if any poc in dark ages scandanavia
This same person probably says they are pro LGBT+ and then turn around and say, ""Bi people in straight relationships are not bi."" and ""Trans people are oppressing cis people and need to stop."" They have the intelligence of a slice of meatloaf left in the back of a fridge for over 6 months, and cause me to gag as much as said meatloaf.
Tiktok is full of chronically online queer discourse, none of it is worth listening to
miliynamegosha (pictured) did a great breakdown on why this take is not remotely ok and doesn’t even make sense. yt people can definitely be non-binary.
chronic online behavior
No, 0 validity.
I'm not welcome no matter where I go and what I do
This is so goddamn stupid, invalidating and racist
There's some people taking a whole different meaning from what the original person said which IS true, but not this comment or the original person that said it.

Some people are saying it's not that we can't call ourselves that but that we don't fully understand being outside the binary unless we understand that European standards created the current enforcement of a strict gender binary & that it was used to strip other people of their ancestral ideas of gender & general roles of all kinds.

But what was originally said was that the person does not believe we CAN be non-binary because our ancestors started this & are the reason it holds power over everyone. Not remotely the idea above.
Oh wow, I've never seen someone with a sub 80 IQ be able to use TikTok effectively.
As a white nonbinary person this image is kinda offensive
The OP on tiktok that got this conversation got taken way out of context admitted cause of unclear wording. They weren't saying that white people can't identify as nonbianaryfrom my understanding they were saying that the oppressive gender binary that exsists today is tied into white supremacy so white people who are nonbianary and not fighting against white supremacy aren't really helping dismantle the gender binary.
I don't care what colour someone is, just be who you want to be ☺️
Nah, no validity, only gatekeeping and racism
That would be reverse racism as far as I could tell
""Gender is a social sonstruct!""

Isn't race also a social construct? If you're already abandoning one, why try to rigidly enforce the other?
I feel invalidated as a white person... My fears have been confirmed...
Then wth am I ?
Listen vato, you dont need to question your whiteness making you miss somethin for this take
This is utterly ridiculous. Someone explain to me concisely exactly how one’s skin tone has anything to do with whether or not they’re enby? 

Sounds like this person just needs a good hiding. That’s what happens to children that say atrociously rude things.
I saw this exact video on my fyp too it’s just the spiritual successor to amab enbies in women/nb spaces and it’s fucking stupid
Thats the stupidest shit I ever read
The question is, what do they think forcing white people to be binary will achieve? How does forcing toxic institutional mentality into white culture do anything but maintain the toxic white culture they are fighting against.
I get white people not using “third gender” or “two-spirit” or indigenous genders, but non-binary is as general as it gets.
So idk if there’s some greater context that expands on that and makes some nuanced point, but to that sentence in isolation, no. I’d say non binary as a concept isn’t something that belongs to any racial or ethnic group in particular, and shouldn’t. There are terms that do, like Two-spirit or Hijra, and I’d agree with it in those cases because there are cultural meanings with some of them that don’t perfectly match up and just generally appropriation isn’t a good thing. I’d also point out that people have argued the exact opposite - that *only* white people can be non binary, and that’s also nonsense.

I think something that’s always worth keeping an eye out for is that reactionaries will use progressive sounding arguments deliberately to sow conflict between marginalised groups… idk if that’s the case here, and sometimes people who genuinely are otherwise fairly progressively minded are also prejudiced and express their prejudices in ways that resemble a progressive argument.
I’m black… this person is tripping lol
No validity. Binarism is gender theory and while it culturally intersects with race insofar as you can be a person of color and non-binary, or biracial and non-binary, that terminology refers to sexuality and gender categories, not racial ones. 

I think maybe this person is mixing biracial with non-binary. Either way this is just gatekeeping of queer spaces.


This kinda essentialist in the same way that second wave radfems get when they get mad about the existence of trans women.
Honestly, this feels like a really bad game of telephone from the arguments I've seen for it

""Colonizers (white people) largely created and perpetuated gender roles"" (The truth in it)

""White people created gender""

White people created gender which has been enforced in a racist way, thus white people shouldn't be able to have different gender identities due to racism"" (Not only using an element of mistruth, but it doesn't help anyone.) 

I agree that there HAS been racism in the non-binary community, especially the seemingly common stereotype (that I've unfortunately seen used in our own community) that every nb is white, afab, skinny and depressed, but saying white people can't be non-binary is only going to create more pointless in-fighting.
You can’t just force somebody to be a different gender & especially not based on race like wtf
Thanks? I figured it was nonsense but damn tgat was invalidating too come across.
Lmao how has so many actually taken that seriously, and how can these morons actually convince themselves, that this makes an ounce of sense??
Came here to say this. It is stupid and what they do talk about should only be valid if, for example, I, as a white nb person with no roots other than Dutch, chose to identify as third gender or any other identity outside the binary that has long been present in other cultures.
no youre good lol im black too and the person who started this shit admitted they were being inflammatory on purpose.

&#x200B;

theyre right about not being able to dismantle the gender binary without challenging white supremacy bc theyre intertwined, but they turned the target of the criticism from white nb ppl who say they’re fighting the binary but ignore racism to  white nb ppl so they could get more views. no one should take them or any other hot take that originates from tiktok seriously. it was never meant to be a place for legitimate discussion and the way the app works makes it near impossible to have a nuanced conversation. Say No to Discourse.
you're not stupid, you're right.
Thank you. I appreciate hearing the opinion of a POC.
Right, cause non-binary is literally an umbrella term for anyone who isn’t exclusively male or female, i feel like gatekeeping the term “non-binary” is kinda very stupid
Thats exactly what i thought! 

White people on OKcupid identifying as two spirit.. its a bit weird
It is indeed very stupid, and the person who started this dumb idea admitted they made it up just to start shit, likely for views. There were people in the comments of the original video who were essentially saying “I’m white and nonbinary and this makes me feel bad so it must be true.” Tiktok is probably the worst popular social media platform.
Seconded
I'm taking some anthropology courses, and seeing that other cultures had NB identities before my ancestors showed up and made it illegal....makes me really angry. 

I just don't see the logic of forcing *me* to be binary because my asshole ancestors said so. In fact..... I probably have a foot in the door to change that. This person is angry for good reason, but directing the anger to me doesn't accomplish anything. Anger is one of the most useful emotions for social change, and they're just gonna waste it on a fellow NB?
Exactly this. European imperialism has bought homophobia to many countries, and the intersection between white supremacy and homophobia is a deep one that needs to be floodlit and unpicked. It would be ridiculous though to say that white people can't be gay because of it.
Agreed. Also happy cake day!
When people keep suggesting I try Tiktok's queer community, I just think of stupid shit like this.
tiktok is where logic goes to seize and die
Non-binary people can't win, amirite?
People say both things which are still incorrect. I have seen others talk about having similar experiences so you're def, not alone.
Hey, I've heard that feminism is a white thing.
I would even argue that NB people have existed in white cultures as well, but the cultures actively decide to bury it. If white people told the Hijra of India that they were now illegal, they're most definitely doing the same thing to trans(femme) women at home.
Thank you.
Becoming my favourite phrase lately.
it doesnt. gender and skin color are two different things, idk why these terminally online people try to stir shit with this bs
That I can understand and get behind. But it feels like they are just trying to invalidate enby white people for some performative moral high ground.
This is a very valid criticism, too bad in the internet what gets passed around are the ""hot takes"" :(
Is there a reason it's more important for nonbinary white people than for binary white people?  I don't disagree that nonbinary white people need to be actively anti-racist, but I'd argue that's true for all white people, not just nonbinary or queer ones.
I would say that race does play a big part in it, but it doesn't invalidate anyone. Just like how colonial laws and Eurocentric ideals lead to a lot of oppression towards gay people in places that were previously fine with it has made race a part of homophobia. When talking about homophobia on an international stage (eg: the interwebs) it's important for white people like me to bare that in mind.

Does that mean there are no gay white people though? Of fucking course not. Same goes for white enbies; I know they exist, I am one.
Lesbian separatist? Tell me more
I mean I have heard a lot of weird takes so I do think they somewhat believe it.
some people need to go outside and play.
the actual culturally contentious term is third gender as I understand the issue. like two spirit for indigenous people third gender derives form certain black cultures/communities. nonbinary is a different term.
My friend, when my IQ was measured in high school it was 119. I've definitely had worse, more cringeworthy, missing the point even harder social interactions than this. Thankfully not in a while though.
Eh, reverse racism isn’t a thing. My write butt isn’t going to be oppressed for my skin color.
Apples and oranges. They *are* both social constructs, but the effects of the constructs are different. As an example; while the idea of ""womanfacing"" is transphobic TER nonsense, blackfacing is an *actual* problematic example of aggressive cultural appropriation. So you can see how it's fine in some situations to say ""white people can't..."" where it would ridiculous to say ""\[gender/AGAB\] can't...""

Saying ""White people can't be enby"" *is* ridiculous though.
I haven't watched these tik toks. Are these primarily cis people spreading this message or is it other non-binary people? bc the latter is worse
many of us take things we don't understand seriously because we know that we don't know everything, and that stuff we once thought was obviously ridiculous has turned out to be true. I once thought it was fine to say the n word as long as you didn't say it *at* someone, and that promiscuous women were asking for it, and that there were two genders. if I dismissed everything out of hand if I disagreed with it, I'd still be an idiot and an asshole today 🤷🏻‍♀️
Lots of online spaces reward this kind of hot take. If it says that white people/men/people with other privileges can't do something, it gets clicks, and people trying to be The Most Woke will like and share without a split second of thinking.
no exactly like this is why i deleted tiktok. the discourse was impacting my mental health too much
Exactly this. People take real academic terms/concepts but need to turn them into short viral videos. I quit twitter because if I ever wrote a multi tweet no one would take a singular tweet into the context of the thread, they would just retweet the one and freak out. With tiktok its just a lot of mean spirited videos to either gain hate views or find people willing to engage with the shittalking.
I really appreciate you sharing, your explanation and analysis made the whole situation a lot more clear
i would hope most if not all non-binary people are not on board with white supremacy and by extension are actively making choices that contract it.
Correct.
Slight correction. Isn't man or woman. If you're not male or female you're intersex.
The creator probably thought that because it was about white people they were punching up and completely ignored the fact that non binary people are still a marginalised group no matter the skin colour.

People have also started saying AFAB enbies aren't actually enbies and I think I'm going to uninstall tiktok because my whole page is making me dysphoric
I love you
Thirded
There are arguments to be made for non-binary identities in white cultures pre Christianity 

https://www.genzher.org/digitalmagazine/the-prescence-of-non-binary-vikings-in-viking-societies
Exactly. The main targets of white supremacy, homophobia, and imperialism are people of color, and as such, they take priority in being protected and offered reparations from it, but a poison is a poison, and it hurts white people too, despite supposedly being meant to position them at the top of the hierarchy, but even most white people aren't at the top, the 1% using it as a tool to maintain their status are the ones who enjoy the most benefit and privilege from keeping people divided or enslaved. It's just that white supremacists, terfs, gender criticals, etc. are too complacent in their own misery for whatever reason or are too obsessed with themselves vs. the other to wake the fuck up and realize what bullshit they've actually been willingly swallowing for most of their lives. 

But white people CAN deconstruct their own complicity in this system. If you go back far enough, even we had our own cultures before colonialism decided that the One Christian God was going to be forced down everyone's throat, and it wouldn't shock me if we had our own cultural forms of non-binary identity even if I have a hard time finding evidence of it.
Oh wow! I didn't even realize! Thanks!
It isn't that bad if you let the algorithm recommend the right people but yeah. Some people are weird. I don't use tiktok anymore so I can't judge people not wanting to lol
i don't like the tiktok queer community it's so discourse driven and all the popular takes are bad DX
I've heard that too. Why is anything progressive always pegged as white? That shit annoys me so much.
ikr, its annoying when they do that
Yes it's important for all of us (white people) to understand and actively oppose racism, but it's my take that all of us (white enbies) are being offered an opportunity *though our very existence* to observe power structures such as queerphobia. This allows us to see similar structures in, and how they intersect with, power structures such as racism. This *should* help us to develop compassion for different, but just as unjust, oppressions, as well as letting us see how they both feed into each other. On top of that it informs us how our privilege is shielding us from a *lot* of trans/enbyphobia, and how a lot of horrific acts that were both racist and transphobic were committed in our names. So overall we should be more empathetic towards the victims of racism, and use this to motivate us to be better allies *especially* as far as trans people of colour are concerned. Also, even if someone's an arsehole who only thinks of themselves, they should see that weakening the power structures of racism also weakens the power structures of enbyphobia.

So I guess my tl;dr is white people morally should oppose racism but queer, trans, enbies... we by experience should all be more empathetic due to awareness of the hurt cause by oppression, as well as our part in it, therefore we should see the moral need to oppose it more; and it's also in our enlightened self interest to do so.
It sounds great, but unfortunately it just boils down to ""L, drop the GBTQ+"". And then it turns out that most of the people who want to join aren't even L, just ""political lesbian"" cis-het TERs.
I think you may mean two-spirit. AFIK ""third gender / sex"" is a European term that was made to medicalise all people who weren't cis-het or were intersex into one, easy to oppress, group.

EDIT: [Third Sex](https://bandcamp.com/tag/third-sex) is also the name of an awesome lesbian queercore / hardcore punk band who were on Chainsaw Records.

EDIT2: I'm wrong, see reply.
We aren't oppressed thats for sure but there is a such thing as reverse racism as far as I understand, but I am always open to being wrong.
Non binary poc
This is so wholesome, and if I cared enough about Reddit to give them money I would award you for this.

So many people, especially on the internet, really don't want to admit their mistakes. Not only does this stop them from acknowledging future mistakes, it stops other people from acknowledging theirs. By opening up on mistakes you've made you've made it easier for others to recognise those same behaviours, admit them, and correct them. This creates a positive feedback, where they are more likely to engage in self reflection and act upon it. Not only that but it's *embarrassing.* That may feel like a minor thing to overcome, but so many negative interactions stem from being to embarrassed to say or do the right thing. Well done you!

I'm not happy to admit, but I will admit, that I have been racist, sexist, homophobic, and transphobic in the past. I like to think I have learned from those mistakes, but I will likely make more. If I have the courage to admit them and opportunity to showcase them as an example of what *not* to do then part of that courage will be down to people like you.
Love this,  hugs for you
Holy cow your username fits this so damn well. Well said!
thanks for the awards y'all but please give that $ to trans lifeline or a similar org instead :)
Upvoted for deleting Tiktok.

I don’t like trashy spyware that is “hip” and addictive. Also good for you looking out for your mental health. :)
i deleted and then re-downloaded with the sole intention of curating an fyp that deals in recipes, gardening insights, art resources, funny animals, and some light-hearted content about my interests. i’m still using it WAYYY less frequently, but my mental health has gotten a lot better since i decided to avoid discourse on there.
I quit twitter way back when it didn't have threads and was 140 characters only for this very reason. You just can't have a nuanced discussion with those limitations.
and i hope i wake up 10 inches taller tomorrow. life is full of disappointment.
I would genuinely recommend doing so, Tiktok is so fucking damaging and just straight-up not using it at all has made my partner and I feel so much better.
;)
Also, during Christianity! They were rare, and often not accepted, but that doesnt mean they didn't exist and we can't claim them and our identities back.
Shit, even in Christianity [there were cases](https://www.google.com/amp/s/theconversation.com/amp/lgbt-history-month-forgotten-figures-who-challenged-gender-expression-and-identity-centuries-ago-153815).

Non-binary people have always been a thing, just ostracized to different extents. I think it's more that it's just something they avoided putting in your average history book, partly because they didn't understand it and wouldn't know how to accurately describe it.

I have no doubt that non-binary people were just misgendered back then as well and their existence just gets lost in time until there are some very unambiguous features about their lives that make it clear they lived a life that wasn't purely male or female.

Imagine how hard it is to find a good record of someone's queerness when others basically ignored the existence of non-binary people. Historians would have to do a ton of research to ""out"" someone from the past, and there would have to be a very clear set of evidence to argue it.
I don't want to generalize a community, but a lot of it seems to be either bad jokes (bisexuals like every woman and are cursed to like men, oh the horror) or young queer people trying to control the identities of full adults.

(Last part isn't always their fault - kids will be kids and need to learn, but doesn't mean people should have to put up with it)
Yeah I was gonna say..... doesn't sound like a very lesbian take.
There was a whole discourse in the 2010's about this. as a 30y/o trans person who grew up with the early internet I've seen discourse over years evolve and remember quite a bit of it. 

Third gender was at a time taken by certain black communities to define non western genders with an English word. just like two-spirit is an English term that covers a number of identities from a number of indigenous communities.

Third sex wasn't involved in any of the discourse that I remember seeing so I really don't think you're familiar with what I'm talking about.

I didn't mean two-spirit because I didn't know that it was hyphenated. Good job on turning a teaching moment that you chose to engage in into an opportunity to talk down to someone. I will remember the hyphen moving forward.

exactly how i feel. problem is no one's telling the kids off so i think when this gen takes over that queer community is just going to have a culture of label policing and general discourse.

it's icky, i don't like it
I'm sorry I invalidated you. That really wasn't my intention; my intention genuinely was to have a discussion in which I could learn. From my admittedly small amount of research into it this is what I honestly believed about the term ""third gender"", as well as believing people were using it interchangeably with ""third sex"". If you're saying you've looked into it deeper then I'll take your word for it and accept you're right, I'm wrong.

Also I wrote that post quite late and I was drunk and honestly didn't see the part where you mentioned two-spirit peoples. I only *now* know it's hyphenated after reading your reply and thinking I should probably check. I didn't mean to come across as saying ""yOu'Re WrOnG bEcAuSe SpElLiNg"", I hate that too. I just honestly didn't see that part.

Hope you have a nice day.

EDIT: Oh, and I missed out on that bit of internet discourse because I've only just come back from a ten year break from social media. Thank you for pointing out an area I need to catch up on.

Trying to feel more comfortable in my gender identity so here’s me & my guitar :)		"Dude oddly specific, but you look like the beginning of a cool indie film about an enby going cross country in their van and trying to make it in the music business on their own, all filmed in like a vlog style. You look freakin dope

Ps. Also wow you’re eyes are gorgeous, wow
Great picture 
You look great! I dig the musician look! <3
Do all these beautiful people make any one else feel bad about themselves? Just me I guess...
Do you have two different color eyes or is that the lighting? Either way looks hella sick :)
Bad hair day or do you like the crazy look? XD :)

Took these while I was tripping on shrooms and suddenly felt way more confident in my identity as non-binary. Anyone wanna guess my birth gender?		"You look amazing! And I get the vibes that your birth gender was a demigod
Assigned Gay At Birth
Your birth gender is pretty as fuck, nothing else your honor
I’d been questioning my gender for a long time but it was one particular mushroom trip that made me know for certain that I’m nonbinary.
You're amazing.💛🤍💜🖤
Yeah, in guessing your birth gender was epic. Oooh or maybe stunning. For sure one of those.
You look awesome and I definitely couldn't tell your agab on sight (although you did have a slight hint in a previous post, in case you don't want anyone to know)
shrooms made me a man 🙏🏻
Your birth gender may be non binary but I’m unsure
You look so great! I have no idea what your birth gender is, you look super nonbinary 😭❤️
You look like you were born non-binary, beautiful person!
Was your birth gender “cute” or “adorable”? Cause that’s the vibe I’m getting
🕵🏼‍♀️What were you painting?
omg 🥺 you're too cute that last pic melted me
i need to do my shrooms. i’ve had em for like 5 months
The first one you look male but in the others you look female, idk if that’s what you were going for but I can’t tell. /pos
Fellow degenerate drug user! It's great to meet another one. I hope your trip was fun and enlightening.

Also I can barely see anything about you through the red light, and you're presenting pretty neutral. If this were an SAT question with no penalty for guessing I'd guess female, but I'm really not confident in that at all.
Lol you’re cute ❤️ Aren’t shrooms just a good time though?? 😆
Yeah straight up, I have no idea what you were assigned at birth and sincerely do not care. You look great and seem happy and that's all that matters.  
  
  Just be.
your gender is being awesome 😎
Omg, you’re adorable!
I'm guessing your birth gender was, breathtakingly gorgeous. Wait no, can't be, cause you're still gorgeous
I wanna see ur cat. The toe beans are not enough
Your gender is adorable and your sex is irrelevant to the rest of your identity.

Be safe when using those things, try to have someone you trust with you.
Literally can’t tell if you’re AFAB/AMAB. I do know you look 🔥
What the fuck I cant tell your agab
you're agab was a nb icon

you look great though!
That smile 💖🥺🌈😍hhghHg
if your agab hot cause you are 🔥
Gods you're beautiful! Wanna do shrooms together? ;)
Omggg thank you. I wish I had the power to smite. ⚡️
LMFAO!!
Guilty as charged lmfao
Ayahuasca basically beat me over the head with the idea that I should be a lot closer to _girl_ than I was currently presenting myself until I gave in and tried exploring gender a bit. I haven't been back to the drug since I picked a fem name for myself, so I don't know what it thinks of my progress so far.

But damn was that a persistent psychedelic (not mean, not angry or sad, just persistent). I thought they were supposed to be a lot more mercurial.
I feel y’all, various psychedelics were like hey you pushed this down a long time ago but this is the true you, why are you crushing the beauty of your true self? Who are you serving by not being yourself? Your power is rooted in embracing your innate femininity. Bringing it into the light will bring you there too. Otherwise you will live in shame in the shadows barely hanging on as you self delude and pretend to be something you’re not. It was soo healing but really scary at first too. 

Ever since the period in my life where I’d regularly consume these plants and compounds I’ve been largely sober and haven’t had a true trip in almost 2 years. I too wonder what I would learn now or if I’ve been on the right track
Same here wow so glad to hear that. I was reading at that time a lot of gender theories and the cyborg manifesto and I understood better the connections between my body, gender, the nature and technology. So wild.
Tysm! 🥰🥰
;-; tysm I prefer thinking is was epic or maybe legendary
Super detective OwO wow 🕵️
God bless the power of psilocybin 💗🍄🧚🏼
You mean they look androgynous. You can’t look non-binary because it’s not a third gender. 

Just remember there’s no correct way to look non binary. Just because you don’t look androgynous, it doesn’t mean your identity as non binary isn’t valid.
UwU tyty
I tried to paint some dnd figures but the paint was blocking the hole in the bottle and the come up was too strong so I exploded it
Hehe Tyty (⁄ ⁄•⁄ ⁄•⁄ ⁄)
It was indeed!! UwU
You must be a genius. The squishmallow pic really makes me look more feminine I think
Shrooms are 10/10 the best
I do be being tho. I am.
Why thank you (☾ ᴗ͈ˬᴗ͈)♥︎
Tyty ;-;
She’s the best creature in the world.
It was actually my first solo trip and I never take anything more than a small dose. I can’t smoke weed cause it makes me paranoid so shrooms are 10/10 as long as I keep the dose low
Omg happy cake day!
A wonderful complement (⁄ ⁄•⁄ ⁄•⁄ ⁄)
(⁄ ⁄•⁄ ⁄•⁄ ⁄)
I prefer solo tripping
Well I think you can smite with your looks 👉👉
I got hit with a “what are you so nervous about you always say you don’t care what other people think about you because you know that’s the type of person you want to be. So stop caring” and I had some very positive self reflection after that. 

My brain tricks me into thinking I’m some type of villain. Telling me I’m lying to myself and that I’m narcissistic and manipulative. After that self reflection I realized me not being true to myself was the starting point for those types of thoughts because it made me feel like I was also lying to the people I cared about. 

As long as you know how to listen to psychedelics you’re can find ways to have them guide you through your own thoughts and emotions and, like a dream that you can finally decipher, everything just seems so much more clear.
I look [REDACTED] but i feel Amazing~~
they look nonbinary
But if you set off my queer-dar enough maybe you do look nonbinary
😘🥰
IVE DONE THAT! Except I didn’t look that good, I looked like I was auditioning for the Blue Enby group.
Awuh man! I have had that happen more times than I would like to admit. In any form of painting, but those tiny miniature paints bottles are the wooooorst! Looks good on your though 💜
Then you nailed it
Then you succeed. We are.
:3
That was so smooth lmfaoooooooo
OMG yes that too! It’s a lesson that has been very hard to integrate too because i still very much care about what people think of me although it’s in a different way now. Like I used to be scared of people knowing I was queer or trans but now it’s like I want to open peoples eyes to accepting trans people, and trying to come off super nice and confident by just being myself etc. However I still mask with maybe too much niceness and I wind up holding my tongue a lot when I get misgendered etc because I know that getting mad will make it get harder but I then also get upset with myself for lacking full sincerity. It’s all so complicated but anyways good luck out here on self actualizing and figuring yourself out, it’s a life long journey
Thx! It’s probably my best one 😅
Just try to put it nicely and don’t let it upset you. Society still has a ways to go with understanding gender and it’s better to correct people than let them call you the wrong gender and get used to it. It’ll just make it harder in the end for all parties involved. I think it’s funny when people call me sir and then realize I my agab was female and get so awkwardly uncomfortable lmfao but I really have no pull towards either gender and so it doesn’t bother me at all and I can relate to being too nice to correct people. I don’t want to make them feel any more uncomfortable. If you know what pronouns you’re the most comfortable with (for me I’m not specifically any of them) it’s best to let people know. As selfish as it may sound you’re the most important in your life and anything that gives your mental health a pull up in the right direction you should push towards. You’ve already made it this far and the best way to open peoples eyes is to advocate with your own voice :3
yeah it’s not so much the misgendering by strangers that bugs me (I love the gender confusion I give strangers) but people in my family/friends circles. They wind up being like oh sorry and shit and idk how to respond to that cuz I don’t want to be like “it’s okay” but i also don’t want to be a hard ass. I also don’t know how to respond to people asking me pretty deep questions about my gender or even slightly invasive ones about where I’m going in my transition etc. I try to be pretty open cuz I feel like sharing my personal experience and explaining that none of us are all the same or have the same goals is just a good thing to know but I also feel bad for not really bringing up how invasive these questions actually are sometimes and fear that they might think it’s okay to ask other trans people (who may be much less comfortable being that open) these same questions. I also sometimes get the impression that these people are like trying to figure out if my transition is valid from their perspective and that always feels really weird and is something i’m not sure how to call attention to because it’s not really explicit. However I will say that sometimes I also get the impression that people might be looking to see if they share similar feelings and that they might actually be trans themselves without knowing it. If that’s the case and people are really out here looking for an excuse to be trans then they probably are but such intentions are rarely shared so directly that I could make such an assessment. I hope that by being honest I could help someone get the confidence/self awareness to make such a realization but there’s still that doubt that the way I discuss things is anything truly productive. I’m sorry for all this rambling, I don’t mean to make you give me clear answers to these things, they’re just things i’ve noticed that I’m sure other people can probably relate to. 

Anyways thank you for the advice and the kind words! We’re all walking a long road, but hopefully the destination is worth it and we remember to take the time to appreciate the beautiful landscapes along the path. Stay safe out here"	uc4peg	NonBinary	426	0.98	2022-04-26 04:50:45

As of January 7 2022 it is now illegal in Canada for any kind of conversation therapy. This includes gender identity and sexuality.		"Yes! Canada has criminalized conversion therapy as of yesterday, and the law protects people of all ages.

https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/canada-bans-conversion-therapy-joining-handful-nations-rcna8253
Can't believe it took this long
Good, about time, and long overdue.
I'd say ""hell yeah Canada"" but also it took this long so I'll leave it at ""it's about damn time Canada""
Excellent. Many members of Parliament in the UK’s ruling party are opposing a conversion therapy ban on “think of the children” grounds.
Canada looking extra nice rn, if Colorado doesn’t work out I’m going there for college
[Meanwhile, not even half of the states and DC has banned it outright. 22 states and 4 territories have no laws whatsoever.](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/conversion_therapy)
Somehow read this as hormone therapy and was VERY angry and confused as to why everyone was celebrating it. 

I'm dumb lol, this is amazing. I'm glad they decided ruining people's mental health and self-image is something they aren't gonna allow anymore
This is amazing
Love it! Do they still allow ABA? That shit's conversion therapy too
Sorry, I'm not really sure here. The bill defines conversion therapy as a practice or treatment designed to ""change"" or repress a person's sexuality, gender identity, or gender expression. Here's the document:

https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-4/first-reading

I don't really have the knowledge to say how this applies to ABA. I hope it does, and if there are loopholes in the law, they should be addressed and closed.
not Canadian (although I am kinda considering moving to Canada at some point because America is honestly kinda crappy), but I am autistic, and I think I see what Canada should ban next if they allow that shit
unfortunately, if it's specifically saying to ""change or repress a person's sexuality, gender identity, or gender expression"", then I don't think ABA is included in the ban. from my understanding after a quick google search and consulting wikipedia ABA is supposedly to ""help"" kids with autism/behavioral disorders behave ""normally"", which as an autistic person is just bs tbh
I wish i could move to canada, but sadly their immigration office has tightened their restrictions in recent years so unless you have a lot of money, a good job already lined up, or you're a doctor or something you're basically SOL"	rz2ju9	NonBinary	421	1.0	2022-01-08 15:39:24

Hey y'all. I recently began questioning my gender identity, and would really like some guidance. I believe I am non-binary, as I've always been androgynous l, and don't feel like I fit the norm. I embrace both masculine, and Feminine qualities, and just want to better understand. Help?		"you can express yourself however you like it has nothing to do with gender but if you think you are nonbinary it’s more of something you have to figure out yourself. search up some stuff about being nonbinary and if it applies to you. even if it doesn’t apply, know that because that one thing doesn’t apply to you it may not be the determining factor of your gender. you can use gender neutral pronouns or dress however you like and it doesn’t make u enby. just saying this because i wasn’t educated about this before and maybe you are unaware too. hope this helps.

tl;dr: less how u dress and more about how u feel.
Ok first of all the picture already radiates massive enby vibes.

Secondly, just start using the term and see how it fits and if it feels comfortable.
One of the most impactful pieces of advice I stumbled across was a quote from Janelle Monae to the effect of “I continue to learn and discover new things about myself.” (I’m certainly paraphrasing here lol.)

But the point it made for me was that I felt a lot of pressure to have “figured myself out” as an adult. That who I claimed to be yesterday, or 10 years ago, must still be true today. I know that’s not true, and that expectation created an anxiety about learning new things about myself because “what if they contradict who I think I am??”

I came out as gay nearly 20 years ago, but my understanding of gender has been lagging. Only recently have I really acknowledged these questions of my gender that have actually been with me for a long time.

Some helpful things I’ve learned along the way is the difference between:
-gender identity (who we feel we are from the inside out)
-gender expression (how we express who we are)
-gender roles (how the world sees us and expects us to act)
-gender and sex (different things)

The above concepts don’t have to align perfectly, and IMO, usually don’t for anyone questioning their gender. It’s also ok to be a cis-person who expresses opposite or other gender. It’s also ok to be non-binary and express binary gender.

Stay curious, let yourself reveal who you are to you, and don’t get too attached to past or future ideas of who you are. Lots of love to you and your baby!
Wow I've never met a baby who could use Reddit before!

Ahaha you'll figure it out. It is completely and totally okay to call yourself nonbinary if you think it fits even if you're not sure or you don't know the specifics of your gender identity yet. Do you have safe/trans-friendly friends to try out pronouns with? (If you want to -- you don't have to change your name or pronouns to be nonbinary). 

Take your time, explore, the water's fine. You don't have to be the paragon of androgyny to be valid and you don't have to figure everything out right away.
Welcome to the family.  Have some coffee and pie.  While your here, look up the website for ND Stephenson.  They are still listed under their professional name of Noelle Stephenson, and they draw comics like Lumberjanes and run awesome queer friendly shows like the new SheRa. 
They are also trans masculine Non Binary.
I just want to say I love your look and that baby’s shirt is so cute 🥰
Keep asking questions! What is the 'norm' by which you are defined? Who makes up that norm, and how? What do you think is a masculine quality and why, what is feminine, how does that differ between cultures, how would you like your local culture to be?

My favourite thing about questioning gender is getting comfortable in that space of questions. I think it's a journey, not a destination :) though if you decide that you want to go somewhere particular with it that's always your choice, too. 

Another thing to explore: nonbinary as a term is defined by what it is not, which means that for many people it is not a particular gender by itself, though for some people that is the word they prefer above all others. So although the outside world often likes to treat it like a third gender, it's much more than that. So you might want to research teams like agender, genderfluid/genderflux, bigender, genderqueer, demiboy/demigirl, and others like these to find other microlabels. Not necessarily because you have to pick one but because the journey of learning about others' experiences are really great for helping to re-calibrate what the ""norm"" is and learn a lot ☺️
What I've found most comfortable, is having people use my name I'm replacement of all pronouns.
As a a non-binary femme that wants to have kids some day, I believe that the title “mother” is deeper than gender. It is a spiritual title that runs deeply in your heart and soul. If you feel like you are “lost” I encourage you to explore using different pronouns for yourself! You are not alone ♥️♥️♥️
I’m finding with my own exploration that non binary isn’t one definition or another it seems to be a spectrum. I use both feminine and masculine attributes and feel more “neutral” when I regard myself . Maybe same for you ?
That picture is so cute!!

You can express yourself however you would like, I’ve tested with many different gender identity’s over the years and I think I figured out mine. I’ve been Genderfaun for about 4 years now.
This is a good forum to be who you are and explore. People are very kind and welcoming.

Another thing to think about is where this comes from, what might be in your way of  living how you want to live? What feels wrong to you, if anything? 

What feels \*right\* about letting go of the idea that you are the gender you were born as? It's often a mess of external expectations ""Being female means you X"" when X often doesn't have to be true or shouldn't have been forced upon you. 

Anyway, I blabber on too much at times. I found this website very helpful in thinking about things [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/)
Maybe start off if you do feel as you are non-binary like broad labels if you want to lable yourself while you're finding an actual lable that may fit you? As a young enby I found researching led me to find many micro-labels (like mini labels that are more specific but you can identify with the lable that umbrellas that term of that made any sense?) I also found for pronouns that if you don't feel that the more common pronouns like he/him or they/them don't feel right maybe neo-pronouns are a fit for you!

I hope that may have helped a bit? I wish you good luck on your gender finding journey and if they are any other people questioning who read this comment!
you could be genderfluid!
i’ve heard this somewhere before but. rather than knowing you’re dysphoric about your gender, focus on gender euphoria. i’m not sure if i phrased that right but basically you don’t have to necessarily be dysphoric about having female traits, but rather if you feel euphoric calling yourself nonbinary or existing in that space then good for you! you probably are
you might be intergender. It means that, in the gender spectrum, you’re midway between girl and boy.
Come on in, the water's nice and warm.
From your title it's super clear that you understand. Now you have to see if it feels right for you.

Also I agree with another commenter that this picture has big enby vibes.

If you have any questions about medically transitioning as a nonbinary person (if that's something you're interested in), pls feel free to dm me! I'm currently microdosing Testosterone. I'm also almost 1 year post op top surgery. Medical or not, I love talking through transition goals with people :)
Just be a woman who has her own personality, likes, interests, and style. Easy.
If you are looking to put a label on your gender, maybe either agender or genderfluid might fit?

Agender is when you don’t have a specific gender identity and some describe it as being gender neutral or genderless.

With identifying as genderfluid, it means you would move between two or more gender identities so maybe one day you might want to present femininely and use she/her pronouns and another day you might want to be masculine and use he/him pronouns.

These are just a couple ideas for some identities you may feel you might resonate with but maybe to help you figure it out you can play around with different pronouns! Try asking your friends to refer to you using different pronouns than they typically would, and see how it makes you feel with each set of pronouns.
Obligatory I'm Cis, but...

Take some time to approach presenting with what you feel comfortable with. Perhaps refer to your self utilizing some different pronouns and see what best fits, explore your style of dress, etc, although you definitiely look androgynous. If and when comfortable talk to those you are close to but do not feel pressured to do so - make sure you are comfortable every step of the way.
Thank you for your advice.
Thats really great advice. Thank you. Also, I've never heard or seen the term enby before.. would you care to enlighten me?
Thank you. Great words. Love from us!
I appreciate those words. I do have a few people who are safe to try out different pronouns. I'm drawn to they/them. My partner is always super supportive of me, but I havent yet had this conversation with him.  It's not because I'm scared.. I guess I'm just not sure how to bring it up.
Awesome advice. I live in a super close minded area, and I honestly know very few people who can answer questions like this for me. Then I remembered reddit existed. Haha. I will definitely look into those as well. I guess I was drawn to nonbinary because honestly I'm tired of close-minded people assigning different actions and interests with a gender. I'm going to be raising my child to explore their interests with a non bias attitude towards what a good bit of society labels male or female.
Something I often notice just reading people's stories is that many enby's have relationships to ""male"" and ""female"" that is a ""both"" and others have a relationship that is a ""neither"" or ""irrelevant"". For me and many others, it's a mix of these, and I'm always re-engineering my notion of gender, so that strong doesn't mean masculine and soft doesn't mean feminine to me, etc.
That's called null pronouns. Just a fun fact I guess.
Thank you <3
Yes! This put in into better words than I was able
Thank you. My baby is so precious <3 Ans I glad youre discovering yourself <3
Thank you! I'll check that out!!
I'll definitely look into that! I seriously appreciate all the information and advice everyone is contributing.
I love this haha
I appreciate that! Also feel free to message me at any time with your progress! I'd love to hear your story!
I just don't feel like simply a woman.
Thank you!!
Thank you!
no problem <3
It's just a short term for nonbinary - nb, or enby
short version for nonbinary person

use it like you would the term boy, girl, man, woman, ...

""He is a man.""  
""She is a woman.""  
""They are an enby.""

like that
Exhausted enby here so sorry if I sound drunk but I wanted to come in and say you could also try multiple pronouns like he/they or any other combinations, I wish you luck in your gender journey and I want you to know that no matter what is okay to experiment and make mistakes and it's okay to come out more than once <3
You can decide on your own timing and priorities. Personally, I would say something to your partner once you start asking safe friends to start trying out pronouns, even if it's just that you are exploring something about your identity with friends, in discussions, but don't quite feel ready to talk about it yet with partner. That's at least acknowledging that there is a thing you are telling others that you aren't telling partner. If you don't do at least that, I think it could feel like a lie of omission. Depends on the relationship, but I'd feel hurt if my partner didn't at least tell me there was a thing happening, then I find out about from someone not them, somehow.
Yess I love hearing how you're just going for it and making such a lovely space for your child 😍  I hope you continue feeling welcome here and just keep asking questions and talking about things as you need.

Something about your words reminds me, did you ever read the Tamora Pierce books, like the Woman Who Rides Like a Man? The author has said in recent years that if she'd known about nonbinary identities back then, she would have called her character in that book nonbinary, because that character was 100% about breaking down biased gender expectations. If you like fantasy, you might enjoy those books and keeping copies for your kid in future years, I think they're aimed at young teenagers but I still love them as an adult. (Though I couldn't say how much of that is the nostalgia factor 😆)
This is a tangent, but when I was an online community manager and someone would give the tired ""You're forcing your belief system onto me by making me use trans person's preferred pronouns! I believe plural pronouns for a single person is a crime against English grammar"" I'd counter that, ""I'm actually not, I'm insisting that you not do any hostile misgendering, like using the wrong pronoun for them. But you are welcome to use their username, respond to them with ""you"", or simply not address comments to or about them at all.""
ok!
Of course! And the non-binary umbrella includes these genders so even identifying as just non-binary encompasses for these identities!
That makes sense. Thank you. I'm super new to exploring and learning about different genders and identities.
Thank you <3
Thank you so much.  That makes me feel a lot better.
I have not read that, but will absolutely check it out. Thank you
Since you're new, just adding that while some people use nb, NB as an acronym is also used online to refer to non-black people, so that can cause confusion in some spaces. Enby is often a safer bet :)
No worries, it's a journey :)
Another important thing about the nonbinary label is that nonbinary doesn't always mean the same thing to every nonbinary person. It just means not man or woman, could mean man like or woman like and some nonbinary people do somewhat identify with man or woman. Which I know makes it a bit more confusing but it's important to not think about it as a third option, it just means not the two that are already set out or with a distinct difference from the other two. Sorry if I confused you a little bit, just trying to clarify that its a different experience for a lot of enby people and that you don't have to be androgenous to be nonbinary.
oh wow *i* didn't even know that!

but i predominantly use enby instead of nb anyway, so i guess bullet dodged?
No, that makes a lot of sense. Thank you for educating me :)
true, i should have noted that

my wording really made it look like just 'the third gender' instead of a spectrum
Haha yeah it's easy to miss. Though generally I've found no one is super antsy about the mix up if you just switch contexts as needed without drama. I just know being a newcomer to online queer spaces means adjusting to a lot of info and invisible social rules, and so getting a heads up can take the stress out a bit!

 I'm glad it's been chill for you :)
Thanks for the advice!!
Well i started my introduction into the queer community (i'm not gonna write out all the letters every time anymore, even tho i know them) from the side of the ace and aro spectrum. Luckily, they've been one of the most understanding queer subcultures i have been a part of since. (probably because we are less blinded by and more aware of our emotions, don't @ me) I bet had i realized i was enby first that wouldn't have gone nearly as smoothly as it did.
The ace crowd are pretty great. Definitely tempted to @ you on that one as a demisexual person with some messy ace friends but 😂 I recognise the added tensions of allosexual communities for SURE have their dramas, hahah
I’d bet the ace community is accepting because of how hard they’ve had to fight to be accepted themselves.
Wait you're also demisexual? Coincidences i swear. What, you're gonna tell me you're aro too, because then we literally have the same identities.
Hehe nah I'm a sappy romantic 😆 Though when relationships are the primary means of found family and solidarity in this economy, who's to say what's romantic and what's the romanticisation of emotional stability? 😂 (kidding, but... only a little bit)
Can someone be ace and a sappy romantic who would love a live partner w/ cuddles but no sex? And could that person be called an ace demicuddlual? I want to fondly suggest this to a friend who this fits. Of course, she's really poly on the cuddles, but demi on the ONE to spoon pajama'd through the night.
it's called being an alloace, but your term is funny /pos"	s7pshz	NonBinary	394	0.98	2022-01-19 13:09:23
I've been having some rough weeks. Just trying to remember that I'm valid no matter what and so is my gender identity.		"You look super awesome here!

Needing support/encouragement/validation. Came out as non-binary 6 months ago and struggling to be seen/respected by my cisgendered community and family. I am real! I am valid! My identity is not a preference, it is a truth!		"You are valid as long as you think you are, don't let anybody tell you the opposite 
We're all valids in our identities
I had a great conversation with my partner a few days ago. I communicated how it makes me feel when I am being consistently misgendered. I told her that I know she is trying and that I know she loves me. But that I still feel it when I hear someone that loves me use my wrong pronouns. It was a long conversation, but it was a huge moment. Many cis people just need it explained to them. They don't usually understand gender dysphoria, and that simple act of communicating how it feels does wonders for their empathy.
Fukin cishets fam they're the worst . When I came out to my mum not that long ago she literally said ""I don't like it ,I gave birth to you"" as if my gender is a shirt I asked for and its not HER style so I can't have it and she does that as well
We got your back sibling! Ne strong and be you!
Hello wonderful nb friend!!! You look strong and brave and lovely!!!!!
I know it's hard, but you can get through this! You're bound to find someone offline who'll support you, just look at how many people are on this sub. You ARE valid, and you shouldn't lose sight of that. Stay frosty friend! :)
You are a beautiful and valid person! Keep being you 🌞
It's a truth! We are real.
We see you, you got this! x
You're real, you're valid, being NB is awesome. We see you!
you’re so valid oh my goodness! i understand the struggle, ive been out to my friends and schoolmates for over a year now and i still get misgendered, and my family didnt respect it in the first place. the main solace and comfort ive been able to take from it all is that i know my own truth, and i know what i am. stay positive, stay true, and stay you!
Dude you're so valid! Fuck anyone who says otherwise! Keep fighting, we'll all support you!
My mum was the same at first, she said she felt like I'd killed my old self. My dad thought it was a reaction to something bad that has happened to me years earlier. 


Mum changed. Now she advocates for LGBT+ people and sends me links and documentaries. She educated herself because she loves me. I'm sure my dad would have come around had he lived long enough to understand the science behind it. 


People can change, don't lose hope.
Be* sorry, mobile + new nails lol
Thank you . It has only been a week but I just wish they let me do what I want and have what I want when it comes to my gender straight away . I will try to educate them but I have a feeling it won't go so well"	jcosjl	NonBinary	378	1.0	2020-10-17 04:23:37

Shaved my head🤷🏼‍♂️Now I wish I didn’t because I felt I was just getting passed the idea of needing very short hair to validate my identity		"You look amazing with a shaved head though!
Nice thing about hair (while we have it) is that it grows again.
So, you tried, now maybe you get used to it and like it, maybe you don't, but it ain't final.

I think we all use crutches to validate our identity and many of us wonder if we need those crutches. E.g. do I need make up to feel feminine when I think no women should need makeup to look pretty or feminine? 

So, you did it. Enjoy it and if you don't feel like yourself, just let it grow.
Well you can let it grow again. Don't be afraid to be yourself. Non-Binary is not a look. If you say you are non-binary, you are non-binary enough. 👍 With or without short hair.
You look great either way.  Honestly, if we were all asked to vote for either one, I'd pick the curls, cuz I REALLY like curls, and they frame your face very nicely.  The buzz cut works equally well, but differently.
I'm currently growing out my buzz. It grows really fast, actually! I totally understand where you're coming from, too. Hoping that I'll be happy once my hair starts to actually get long.
You look awesome in both pictures
Halsey has been real quiet since you posted this 

You look amazing!
The short hair looks good on you, but I understand your misgivings about it. Luckily hair grows back. In the meantime, if your hair is causing dysphoria, see if you can find some dapper hats.
Pretty awesome looking! Now's the time to play with colors, if that's something you're into!
Haha I did the same thing and ended up with a Karen haircut. Long hair still makes us valid!!
Ah thank you😬❤️
Wow. Thank you so much for this reminder. Seems so simple when you put it like that. I don’t know why my mind went to the worst ideas first. Thanks again❤️🥰
I really appreciate the reminder. Thank you so much for taking the time to comment❤️
Bahaha yeah I love my curls. But they’ll be back! Thanks love
Wishing you all the long hair happiness❤️
You’re too kind🥰
Bahahaha best comment❤️
You’re the best. Also I loveee the word dapper. So you just made my day❤️

I hate it when cis women do this	"I have noticed that when I (ftnb/ftm) explain that I'm trans and non binary, and I explain why I'm transitioning all cis women have to say ""well I don't totally feel like a woman either"" 
It's frustrating because my mother for example says it as a way to disregard my gender identity like we are the same just because she likes football and the color blue (even tho I don't like ""boyish"" things). 
And my nb and trans friends, with or without dysphoria, transitioning or not, don't say these things."	"I feel this. Even when they’re not trying to invalidate nonbinary/trans identities, it often feels like they’re trying to say they get it, and it’s frustrating because you know they really don’t. Because at the end of the day, cis women with “boyish” interests or aesthetics could be as masculine or “boyish” as can be, and they would still be cis because they identify with their agab. I feel like there are two separate (though interrelated) conversations at play: one about trans identities and another about social expectations for women, and cis women who make those statements think we’re having the exact same conversation.
""Well *I* have times when I don't like my body too!""

Wishing you were skinnier and less wrinkled isn't the same as feeling distressed by your primary and secondary sexual characteristics, height, voice, etc. because they impact whether or not many people treat you as sane and deserving human dignity when you try to stand up for your identity and ask to be gendered correctly, dearest MIL.
I said this A LOT as an uncracked egg, not gonna lie.   I was very deep in denial and shame, and used the excuse ""I don't feel like a woman either"" to justify my mistreatment of non binary folk and transmen.   
""How do you identify?"" Is a good question to ask when someone says these things.  If they're cis, after putting an ounce of thought into it they come around and go ""A woman, I guess..."" And many of them realize that was a silly thing to say 

If they're like me, however, you're probably gonna piss them off by asking.   I don't ""identify"" as anything, I just am a woman""
Why?
They'll give some kind of response about biology, and if you have the energy you can explain to them that gender and sex are not the same thing.  Again, this is going to piss them off.   My gender and sex are the same!! It doesn't matter that when I think about it at all, they feel completely separate and foreign from each other!! How dare you make me think about it??
And then hopefully, hopefully they'll have a realization down the road that it's not normal to avoid thinking about your gender like the plague.   They'll learn that gender is self expression and supposed to make you happy, make you feel like you, not like a prison.
I hate it when I explain that I'm a guy to cis guys and they ask me ""wHaT'S YoUr FaVoRitE CarR?"". It's only happened twice but I've only been out for a few months. Or when a cis guy just.. ""no you're nOt. You have BewBiEs."" Aka.. I feel you, man/my friend. Here's my honest advice that I do my best to stick to, too. They don't understand your problems. It'd be amazing if they did, but they don't. It's not their fault, and it's not yours. The best things that you can do are, a, talk to them. Tell them that this bothers you. B, take a deep breath, and let it go. Talking to them is better but if that doesn't work, just don't let it bring you down. You're awesome, my friend ^^
So I like to say “that’s not a very cis thing to say … interesting” and then start asking questions about how they experience gender.
Being a man/woman is damn hard work, even if you're pretty firmly in one camp. The pressures to perform your gender within very limited parameters are significant for both men and women, and a lot of people who feel/are told they are doing it incorrectly deserve our empathy, even if they don't feel like another gender would suit them any better. I honestly feel it's all part of a spectrum like many things are. Gender is a social construct after all. It's like money, we made it up. I would take it on good faith that they are trying to relate to you, attempting (ok, and maybe failing) to understand you, not trying to invalidate you.
Ugh, call them on it. ""Would you like me to use different pronouns for you?"" ""How do you identify?"" They should scrutinize their gender. A small percentage of them may not be cis, after all.
It's like, I won't say nobody feels entirely man or woman, because that's not true many people feel absolutely ""man"" and/or ""woman"", and to say otherwise would invalidate that. But, I'm sure some cis people don't feel 'entirely' man or woman. I think its healthy for anyone to explore their gender, but that's the thing, cis people don't need to label that feeling. If more people explored their feelings they may realise something about their gender, but for people who are nonbinary, or any other gender descriptor(s) that are/is not exclusively cis woman and cis man, that feeling is why those words exist.
I mean, “well I don’t totally feel like a woman either” is an interesting remark. If men told me the equivalent of themselves, contextually it would be a pretty bold statement that may raise further questioning of the “oh, really?” variety. It may be a bigger jump for a man to admit such, and betray “egg” (yuck) yearnings. Womanhood, as it is, seems to be a lot to live up to and a performance that so many must struggle to buy into, as distinct from being NB.
Hmmm…this is really interesting, it sounds like maybe your mom is doing it specifically in a way to be dismissive of your identity (as in “I don’t always feel like a woman but you don’t see me going around calling myself non-binary”) that would be different then if she is reflecting on genuine feelings. I’ve never experienced this- when i first learned that people “felt” a sense of maleness or femaleness my mind was blown and i went around asking every cis person I could if they “felt” their agab and they all said “yes” without a doubt. They could not always articulate how or why but they all “knew” their agab was correct and “felt” right. Not once did has a cis person told me they don’t always feel their agab- well, that would make them non-binary by definition wouldn’t it? 

Not trying to be dismissive of your experience, this is just really surprising for me to hear.
Water off a ducks back man. I know it’s hard to feel invalidated but cis women will never understand. Sometimes you just gotta be like “Okay.”
Yeah, there's a lot of reasons why cis women in western society may not feel strong or positive emotions about their gender, what with all the deeply ingrained misogyny and socialized fear and whatnot. But they also don't feel an inherent wrongness or incompleteness about being labeled as a woman. Thinking that gender roles are bullshit is of course legit, but it really doesn't speak to the discomfort we experience when we're misgendered.
That whole argument is a red herring for what's really going on. They may say, ""I like blue, I like football, so I'm not totally feminine."" Yeah, those may not fit the female stereotype, but we don't openly shame women for stepping outside those gender boundaries as fiercely as we do men (except for if it has something to do with exercising power. Then the patriarchy HATES it). For me to want to wear a dress as an AMAB, the rules as they are don't let me do that. I need to create a new system that works for me.
I get that too (even more so when I tell people I have depression and they're like ""yeah I'm sad sometimes too!"") but another thing that makes it difficult is, maybe they're an egg and haven't really thought about it before. I know I went through a whole phase of being sad I was ""technically cis"" and ""not really nb enough to call myself that""... so I think the only real way to move the conversation forward in a productive way is to engage them more in thinking about their gender and also let them know how you feel. It's hard, especially if you're not really comfortable going in depth with them.
Ugh I definitely understand this. This is what happened when I tried to tell my grandma about ""a nonbinary friend I have"", basically testing the waters to see how she'd react. She asked for this friend's name, I said Charlie and despite the name being fairly androgynous she went ""Oh so I assume he's a boy nonbinary."" ...Not how it works grandma haha. 

Something similar happened with my mom too, she compared gender dysphoria to the dysmorphia she feels about being fat. Said that maybe it was just something I needed to accept about myself rather than something I needed to change, like what she did with her own body. For this one the only thing I could think of was that I know that surgeries and hormones will make me feel better, so why not do something that will make me feel better? Lots of fat people try to lose weight to feel better, so how is what I want to be doing any different than that? Then she went on to say ""well they're consequences to being trans"" and I'm like fuckin YEAH I know!! I AM trans! Believe me I know the consequences! And if at least a few of the consequences of T and top surgery make me feel better about myself then bring them on man
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA I FELT THAT IT'S SO ANNOYING 
Like no Brenda your urge to cut your hair short or wear a suit is not a gender crisis:D
So true
I would like to offer some perspective but I’m not trying to invalidate your feelings or justify saying shit like that for everybody- it took me a very long time to realize that I was nonbinary and during my freshman year of high school one of my not so close friends came out as trans and I basically said the same thing except I asked them (in a very blunt and insensitive way because I didn’t understand) why they cared about their gender because I didn’t care about mine. What I now understand about my feelings was that I didn’t feel connected to my femininity because I’m not a woman and I didn’t understand how they could actively desire that because I felt so disconnected and also I really didn’t understand what it meant to be trans at the time. So I would just like to say that it’s possible these people who “don’t totally feel like a woman either” actually don’t feel like women and aren’t actually cis but because they don’t experience strong or any dysphoria they don’t even know or understand that they are also nb. That’s definitely not everyone but it definitely was me and it lead to me saying a lot more shitty stuff to trans people because I really was trying to understand and I just needed to get more in touch with myself and honestly I needed to me told I was uneducated and being rude before I figured it out. At the end of the day other people’s motivations don’t change how you feel I’m really sorry you’re being made fo feel invalidated by these people. You are 100% valid in your identity and how you feel about these people saying stuff like that to you. It is very frustrating to hear so I hope maybe being able to see where some of them COULD be coming from could help you shape a conversation with them in a way that’s productive for everyone. Or not if you’re not looking for that
I do this when I'm trying to explain how emotions feel as a person with borderline and people are unintentionally invalidating. ""Ah, so you know what I'm talking about! Great then you'll understand what I mean when I say, take that concept and expand upon it threefold. Take how you described you feel about not entirely feeling as a woman and extrapolate upon it as if it was much more of core sense of yourself and not just a idea feeling that you're able to relate to.""
I feel like gender is such a nuanced thing that if you don’t feel at odds with your assigned gender then you don’t really feel it. Like if you’re cis , I feel like it’s something you have to look into and examine to understand how it feels. 

She won’t feel like a woman probably because she hasn’t reflected much on it. Stick her in a male body and then see how she feels
Yes!!! My grandmother and basically any female i knew growing up would just casually say things like i wish i could pee stand up(when its cold), i wish i had a penis (period pains), it would be cool to write my name in the snow (random thought i guess) these saying made me question myself for years. They held me back from realizing they were just saying and that these women identified with their agab. 

Well i think all of them my grandmother is still in question. She says things that are a bit sus. And some.e part of transness can be genetic i think. Dont remember where i learned that fact. I could be wrong.
I try to explain it to them like gender is a colorwheel, and then leave it be with oppositional people. If on a color wheel man was all shades of blue: from navy to Robin's egg, and woman was all shades of red: from maroon to blush, then I am a completely different color. I personally say that I am yellow in this example, but you might say green or whatever else. I can see the color, the men experiencing manhood and the women experiencing womanhood but I dont live that experience. People like this are fairly one dimensional in the topic of gender and need a second to think on what I've just said, and in that time I change the subject.
When I came out as NB to a friend she did exactly this! I was livid!
[removed]
“Oh, you don’t? Hm. Perhaps we should look into this together…”

That’d be my response lol
I love trying to turn this into a teachable moment about how gender simply isn't binary. About how we are all wonderful, unique people and no two people experience gender the same way, even if they identify with the same binary gender (or even if they both identify as non-binary)

It usually results in a bunch of glazed-over looks from the cis ppl I'm talking to but I'm the type of person who loves explaining things, so either I taught a cis person something or I totally overwhelm them and they don't want to talk about it anymore lol
I understand trying to relate with a personal experience but it feels more like when I tell someone I'm autistic so that's why I may act weird and then they say ""aren't we all a little weird sometimes"" I know it's not their intention but it feels like they are telling me to not make a big deal out of it and be quiet
Hey, I wondered if you might like to share a bit about your journey from mistreating nbinary people and trans men to cracking your egg? I often don’t hear that happening, it seems to happen more the other way around. No worries if not!
Thank you, here is the only place were I can talk about it without feeling rude. If a dude asks for your favourite car just say the Nissan cube and watch their faces 😂
HHaha I love this!!
I definitely have thought about that and I sympathize, but I can't gelp but feel uncomfortable because I have been told that my gender identity and my dysphoria is just a political ideology
This is an interesting point. I believe we made gender roles and expression up - is that what you mean? But I think gender is inherent regardless of society. I feel my gender is an innate part of who I am and it’s society that convinced me otherwise and it’s taken a lot of unlearning to reach this point. Like I feel quite strongly that if I was away from society my whole life, and had never seen a man before, I would feel uncomfortable with my body even if I didn’t know what I wanted. Maybe that’s something different though. What do you think? ( I’m transmasc btw)
I KNOW! I literally commented that I would say “Oh you do? Then maybe we should look into this together” because if you don’t fully feel like you’re a woman maybe it’s time to question your gender
I would say most cis people don’t feel entirely their gender. I think they just carry out the gender roles expected of them by society and carry on because nothing necessarily feels ‘off’ or another gender role doesn’t feel ‘better’ like it does for us trans folk. I think they just don’t scrutinise what they’re experiencing and so they’re disconnected from their identity and don’t really feel it
I mean, yeah. Who’s to say they’re as cis as they look? I assume most people here were in the closet at some point, so it really confuses me that people are so hostile towards what seems to be a good faith attempt to relate.

Like, we’re nonbinary to be honest to ourselves, not to feel special.
“I don’t always feel like a woman but you don’t see me going around calling myself non-binary” 
this is exactly what I hear. And it is qhite possible that my mom is actually nb since she has said in the past that she feel like a boy and a girl. If that's the case good for her and I will suport her, in that case it would be like ""I've been stuck being a woman all my life so you don't get to be your gender either""
>But they also don't feel an inherent wrongness or incompleteness about being labeled as a woman.

Not everyone who’s not a woman experiences that, and it’s certainly not required to be nonbinary. I’m fine with being labeled a man, I’m fine with being labeled a woman, I’m fine with being labeled whatever - none of these words mean anything to me anyways.
I totally went through that ""I'm not totally a boy, so I'm not trans"" phase. It's not my job to crack someone's shell either
They think we haven't thought of the consequences of coming out and transitioning😂
Also, I have had body dysmorphia and dysphoria and they are different feelings, sometimes they can overlap but the dysmorphia can get cured with learning self esteem and healing traumas. But dysphoria doesn't go away, it just gets worse for me. 
I just wish I could tell this to my mom but J know anything I say will be used against me.
I really appreciate your comment. 
I think that most women in today's society don't feel connected to womanhood because it has a lot of negative baggage and expectations, and outside of the trad definition of what a woman is, there is not an answer to ""what is a woman"".
Some cis women relate to the positive experiences asociated with being a woman and afab but don't feel conected to that mytical unatainable image of what a woman is suposed to be. 
This is all my opinion, I may be wrong.
How did you respond?
This user is a transphobic troll. Reported and blocking.
Yeah, that's when you realize who is actually interested in deconstructing/abolishing gender and who just wants to invalidate my experience
That analogy makes a lot of sense—it does feel very minimizing for people to say stuff like that.
Oh god i know what you mean. I told my MIL i’m getting diagnosed with autism (little by little, broke as shit) and she told me “when they made it a spectrum, it includes everyone!” like literally no but alright
I was ABOUT TO BRING UP AUTISM BUT DAMN! I feel this in my goddamn soul. ""Everyone's a little Autistic"" NO THE FUCK THEY AREN'T, SHARON!! *autisticscreeching.mp4*


~*Takes a breath*~ Sorry, I get a little passionate sometimes.


When someone says that to me, if I have the time and crayons, I try to explain to them how this sentiment is actually super harmful and invalidating. It shouldn't be our job to educate people about Autism, but honestly, who better to do it? This method isn't for everyone, and that's ok. It's what I like to do.
So I've never had these feelings about trans women, oddly enough.  Just nbs and trans men, trans women have always been ""valid"" to me, for lack of better wording. 
NBs we're dumb to me because hurr durr biology, and you can't possibly be something other than a man or a woman because that doesn't exist.  I had a very eurocentric idea of gender and gender expression and refused to educate myself. 
Trans men openly pissed me off because it felt like an escape?  Like no, noone likes being a woman, if everyone was honest wed all be trans

And then I learned from cis people that no, those feelings are not universal, it's not normal to hate being a woman, it's not normal to be grosaed out by your anatomy.  Almost all of it was routed in jealousy that they were able to be themselves, and I had too many hangups to do the things myself.
xD I usually avoid answering :P
>Maybe that’s something different though.

Yeah, that’s different. Being uncomfortable with your body because it’s male/female isn’t exactly the same as being uncomfortable with a *gender* - lots of trans people don’t experience dysphoria and are fine with never transitioning. Honestly it should be called *sex* dysphoria and not *gender* dysphoria, because bodies aren’t gendered in and of themselves.

*Sex* is somewhat inherent, and some people might have an inherent *preferred sex* which causes dysphoria, but that’s a different thing from gender, which is the social component that we made up.
Yeah it's  some human bullshit! I don't know what that dismorphia feels like. Unless we actually transition most people will only ever experience the one gender in their lifetimes so it's really hard to make a comparison! I don't feel like a quote unquote ""woman"", I don't think I'm good at the things that women are told to be good at, I don't feel comfortable with that label. But I'm also clearly not a dude. I don't think I'd be any better at performing a masculine gender. I would like to put my pronouns on things because it's kind and inclusive, but I'm not comfortable with any of them. I respect the trans experience and I want to understand it, but like, I just think gender as an idea is kind of flimsy!
I’m inclined to agree. So long as they’re not doing the “oh, I don’t feel much like my AGAB sometimes” riposte to minimise the NB experience. And even then, perhaps something can be done to relax their resistance; after all, these are unfamiliar concepts to most people. It’s indeterminate whether they’re erasing you, intend to, or aren’t currently persuadable.

There’s probably more to work on than much of what I hear from others (eg. “These days there are about 50 sexes!” from someone in my running club last night, blurted out of nowhere).
yeah, i really don't get where all the hostility is from. get mad at people who make fun of us, discriminate etc., but it's fucking hard being a woman and if they're trying to relate, it's ok imho. i'd even say all afab people will at some point in their lives have been wondering if they're doing the whole female thing right. if you perform femininity, you're shamed for being vain and emptyheaded, if you don't, the world will call you a pick me girl or a not like other girls girl. can't do it right. 

so i fail why we need to get so mad at cis women expressing they've struggled with that, it's obviously not the same as being non binary or having dysphoria, but it's still a valid feeling.
What do you think your mom would say if you said,  not in a mocking tone but compassionately, “mom, I don’t think that is the way most cis people feel, is it possible you’re nonbinary?” You could even follow it with an explanation of what Demi is or something since it sounds like she is connected to feeling female at least some of the time. 

In regards to the second argument you could say something like “most of your life the concept of a binary gender was so predominant that a lot of people didn’t have a concept of, let alone a language for, anything other than male or female. Things have changed and I’m lucky to have a language and community that supports me. I get how this might be confusing or scary to think about, but it’s no longer taboo and I don’t have to deny part of my existence or experience, it would mean a lot to me if you could try give me the support that nobody gave you.” 

Another thing that came to mind while writing this was why? Why does it make her uncomfortable? What does she fear? I know this is an insanely difficult thing to do and would take a crap ton of courage and self control (although if you’ve already been open with her about your gender you are not lacking in courage) but perhaps you could ask her to explain/share why it makes her uncomfortable. She might not know, but asking might open some doors to self reflection and progress. 

My last bit of advice is to you is to try to remember that your mom is just a human, with her own experiences who makes mistakes. Her discomfort probably comes from fear for you having a harder life as well the destruction of the future she envisioned for you. It takes a lot of practice, but you’ll both fare better if you can try  reframe from feeling invalidated and attacked and instead feel sorry for your mom who’s narrow minded thinking is likely from most of her life receiving significantly more frequent and hateful trans and homophobic messaging than you have. I’m not saying it’s ok, but it’s also not her fault, it’s more like bad programming, so you’re left trying to fix the code but it’s so dated it’s in some obscure language you never learned. Of course you’re going to get frustrated trying to figure it out, and it’s prob going to take a few tries, some guesswork and a shit ton of patience but if she’s a good person eventually you two will get there.
I kinda think that falls under feeling like being labeled a binary gender is incomplete. I don't think being called a woman is outright incorrect for me, but it definitely doesn't encompass who I am or how I feel. It's part of me, not the whole of me.
I tried to argue that it was not the same but she didn’t understand. I eventually gave up and changed the topic.
Can you tell me more about being a ""gender abolitionist""? That sounds like a label I can get around
Thanks so much for your thoughtful response. I think I was unclear as I conflated my gender with my sex so my bad. But I agree that they are two different things. I wonder where that means I fit in the community as my sex is my biggest issue and I get the sense that most people feel the way you described -i.e non sex dysphoric 

I feel that my gender, not sex, is core. I feel it is something that I was born with that was then heavily bullied out of me until this point in my life. I feel that innate feeling would exist outside of society as well, but I recognise not everyone feels that way. I think we have an innate gender identity that then either aligns or misaligns with the gender society puts on us and it’s the innate gender that tells us who we are and what we like
I really appreciate that.
For sure!

The general idea is that since gender isn’t actually real and is backed by nothing but our own prejudiced ideals of what it *should* be, we simply should stop acknowledging that it exists, with the long-term goal of erasing its influence on society. No one is *really* a man or a woman after all - there’s no essence of “man-ness” or “woman-ness” or “something-else-ness” deep down that makes us so - these are just stories we’ve managed to convince ourselves to believe. We can stop believing them.

Of course, this doesn’t mean that we should stop acknowledging or trying to fight things like sexism and transphobia - just because someone doesn’t believe in God, for example doesn’t mean they’d necessarily be blind on the impact of the *belief* in God on society - just that we need to look at them from a different angle. 

Instead of “women (as some sort of monolithic, a priori group) are oppressed by society and aren’t given the same rights/opportunities”, we’d say “people who are *labelled as ‘women’ by society* are oppressed because of this label”; similarly, instead of saying “trans people are oppressed by society for daring to live as the gender they really are”, we’d say “people who fair to conform to the expectations of the gender society assigns to them are oppressed as a result”, sidestepping the essentialism that’s sadly all too common in trans discourse."	rw347c	NonBinary	357	0.97	2022-01-04 19:55:10
gotta keep reminding myself that even though i look femme sometimes, my nb identity is still valid !		"💯
Valid and a vibe 🌺🔥✨
100% valid 🏵️🌈💛🤍💜🖤
Valid as heck✨ also your vibes are STUNNING!
Those brows tho 👏
Your identity is your own no matter how 'feminine' or 'masculine' it is by your society's standards. Bodies don't determine gender. You are NB, and that's true no matter what clothes you wear, what hairstyle you have, what makeup you use, what pitch your voice is, how your body is shaped - doesn't matter, you are who and what you are, and that is valid.

&#x200B;

(also love the overall sort of dreamy vibe I'm getting from this pic, excellent all in all!)
Wow
You look awesome. Keep on destroying gender norms.
:)
There is no such thing as ""feminine look"" all looks are unique and special
I thought you hurt yourself and you had a bloody nose and I got so scared- stay safe okay?

I’m still non-binary even if I’m femme!	"I hate how I’ll be talking to someone in public or online and I’ll express how I’m non-binary because I’m very open about my identity, and they’ll tell me “but you’re very feminine so obviously you’re a girl.”

NO.

I’m still non-binary. I go by all pronouns since I don’t mind being referred to as she, but I mainly use they/them. I’m not androgynous and never will be because I’m not comfortable presenting that way. I’m not a girl just because I’m dressed femininely. Clothes don’t have a gender and anyone, even an AFAB non-binary person, can wear clothing that’s seen as typically feminine. It’s not hard to understand yet people don’t want to take the time to listen and learn about it.

I wish more people took the time to look up gender expression and learn it does not equal identity. I wish more people would use gender neutral terms automatically when they see someone that they don’t know the gender of. I wish people understood stereotypes hurt all communities, especially a community that is so vast and different as the non-binary community. I wish people would just ASSUME I’m not a girl even if I’m wearing the most feminine get-up that I could possibly wear.

I just wish more people understood."	"I've been talking about being trans-femme (as someone AMAB) and people keep saying things like ""but why would you want to look femme when you're nonbinary?!"" Weird that they never say ""But how can you be nonbinary when you look masc?!"" to me.
""Even if I'm femme I'm still a them""
Yeah. I have a coworker who routinely misgenders me anyway, but she goes EXTRA out of her way to do it if I'm wearing something she deems femme. I remain very unclear on why this isn't exactly as big of an offense as deliberately using incorrect pronouns/terms for a binary trans person, yet she just keeps getting ""talked to"" about it, never fired.
I may not be femme, but I feel you so much. I don’t even dress femme and people still call me a girl. But something so important that people just don’t understand is that non-binary people do NOT owe anyone androgyny. We can dress as masculine and as feminine as we want and still be non-binary. That’s the point of it all — we do not align with a binary gender identity. I wish more people understood too. Giving you all the hugs.
Valid
_Big_ fucking mood.

Though honestly I'd be happier if we just stopped gendering this stuff entirely. There's absolutely nothing inherently feminine or masculine about aesthetics, and feminine and masculine are arbitrary concepts anyway.
Yeah I know that feel..
When I was exploring my gender one and trans-questioning of the first comments I got was “but you were so femme as a child.” Except I remember being a tomboy who loved playing with boys and girls toys and hated dressing up in dresses. Our outward presentation and people’s interpretation of that doesn’t necessarily (and does not have to) match our internal experience. Hugs to you.
There is no right or wrong way to be non-binary as long as you’re not racist or homophobic/transphobic
I understand greatly as I'm an AFAB enby myself. I do want to dress more masculine.

There's a post somewhere that proves the point you're making. A picture with text of ""you have to dress the part if you're nonbinary,"" and then ""meanwhile, I..."" with a picture below it of a person dressed like a super-femme bunny lolita.
True. I've always struggled enjoying dressing feminine because ppl always assume but tbh I just have a idgaf attitude 😎. Tbh I do like androgynous dressing but I like to combine femme and masc outfits
I’m in the exact same boat as you!! I’m a very feminine AFAB nonbinary person, and I’m just not happy when I present masculinely or androgynously. I’m happy with my long hair and makeup and dresses, but I’m still nonbinary! The way I express myself makes me feel happy and confident, but I’m still nonbinary.
i feel the same :[
I dress masc most of the time, but I work in aviation as a pilot, so it's job security to dress as my perceived gender. Also remember, its not clothing, accessories, make-up, etc...that makes you Non-Binary, **it's what's inside you.**
I have the same issues, people want to assign a binary role even when you tell them it's not correct, it's frustrating. Or they tell me that I'm just a girl who wants attention which isn't the case
I also wish that people who take the time to actually look it up when you tell them and not get the ole “I just don’t understand it” like no sally sue you just chose not to even try
I’m an enby as well. Many people just don’t get it and will not. It’s frustrating as hell sometimes. I will occasionally purposefully dress andro in public and not answer people’s questions about my gender or pronouns. Some will cycle through things, miss or sir, she, he etc. and I just smile politely at them and tell them to have a nice day. I’ve noticed when I act more mysteriously, people are much more pleasant that way. It’s like wearing a veil without actually having one on. When people just let me be, but try to be respectful, I see they are starting to get it. 

Other times it’s people wanting to fight and use whatever excuse that I don’t exist. Lots of times they bring up nature. Which is kind of funny considering how much DNA that humans share with everything, and that nature literally operates in the way people have had to hide about themselves. Anything that’s LGBTQIA+ is literally reflected in nature and the world around us that was here long before we were. That in itself gives me hope.
We non-binary peeps can be whatever the hell we want
I just want to say I admire your self-certainty and your passion in getting this concept into people's heads! 
Not only is this just TRUE, and I'll only speak for myself here, but keeping this fact in mind also helps keep a lot of dysphoria at bay.

I generally prefer presenting mostly androgynous, but there are days where I want to lean into feminine aesthetics and that was hard to accept for a long time because it made me feel like my identity was less valid. But that's BS!
I'm trans mask enby. Present very femme when I go out. Heavy, bold makeup and alt, usually femme, flamboyant clothes, I'm very hard to miss, still go by they/he. They way I usually tell people is ""they way I look has nothing to do with how I identify and it's also none of your business"". I find it works ok depending on the kind if people you come across
fuck yes 💯
I feel ya. I am a masc-presenting amab enby.

Gender expression ≠ gender identity.
THIS! This is so important and I completely agree. I face the same problems everyday and yet I feel guilty for feeling this way. But truly I am non-binary AND I dress stereotypically femininely. They are completely separate things!!! Gender≠expression
You're so valid! Obviously our experiences are incredibly different, because, like you mentioned, no nonbinary person is the same as another, but I can sorta relate. I'm genderfluid between agender and male mostly, however I rarely present in a masculine way because to be honest I hate that style, I think masc clothes are boring and just overall not that comfortable for me. I quite frankly don't give a damn what other people percieve me as and I use any pronouns except they/them, but it would be quite nice if people didn't see long hair and lots of jewelry and instantly assume female. And on that note I find it incredibly strange when other trans/nonbinary people do this, shouldn't other trans people be literally the last people who would assume gender/pronouns?
I've got an appointment next month to start hormones. I'm planning to continue using neutral pronouns and identifying as nonbinary. I still have people questioning why I want to ""become a woman"" and I have run out of ways to try to explain it.
I mean I'm non-binary regardless how I present or whatever pronouns I choose to go by. There's no one way to be non-binary, if you say you're non-binary you're non-binary end of story!
people think I'm a transmasc when I am nonbinary (I do try my best to look androgynous while avoiding certain clothes like leggings mainly because I hate wearing them) they think I'm a transmasc and TELL me I'm a transmasc because I cut my hair short (I would grow it out if I got a cool moustache)
Exactly! Like non binary just means outside the binary, you can present any way you want and identify any way you want
My MIL tries very hard to be supportive, but in a way that makes me think 'bless your heart,' a lot of the time. Before I came out, she used to tease me a lot for being very masc. Afterwards, she keeps getting fixated on anything at all I do that might be interpreted as femme. She, like many confused cis people, can't seem to wrap her head around the idea that 'nonbinary' doesn't always equal 'perfectly androgynous and devoid of gendered mannerisms or aesthetic preferences.'   


""If you're not trying to be seen as \[binary gender\], then why do you \[do anything at all that isn't perfectly neutral by common standards\]?"" has been a repeat conversation about hair, clothes, the way I talk, hobbies, the way I move/walk/sit, etc. I've given up on the idea of her getting it through her head that the answer every single time is going to be ""because \[gender\] doesn't own \[ANYTHING about personal expression and pleasure\], and doing so doesn't make me less NBy.""   


It's [this meme](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/ousa/pages/1917/attachments/original/1582134710/Screen_Shot_2020-02-19_at_12.51.32_PM.png?1582134710) basically every time. Other trans people (at least for the most part) have no problem understanding that (presentation) != (gender). Anyone on any part of the gender spectrum can look/sound/present however the hell they want - it's basic sexism to assert anything otherwise.   


Yet, with (mostly cis) people stuck in the mindset of gender binarism, there's no winning. Any way you look or present, *somehow*, you're the one enforcing sexism and gender stereotypes. Any level of comfort/discomfort with things commonly gendered one way or another is scrutinized as either proof that you're just running away from misogyny, in denial, confused, doing it for attention/to feel special, etc.
This is one of the THE most frustrating things about existing. It’s especially disappointing from people who want to consider themselves LGBTQIA+ positive and feminists. For binary folks, they are so laissez-faire about who can wear what. But then all of a sudden for us, it’s acceptable to be the gender police and subject our presentation to intense and constant scrutiny. And if we aren’t doing what they deem to be ‘enough’ to match their idea of what a nonbinary person should look like (which often includes expensive and painful clothing items, specific body types that are completely unattainable for many of us, and surgery), then they feel entitled to decide our gender for us. 

It’s such an extreme double standard and it makes me so fucking angry. I’m so tired of having to argue with self proclaimed ‘allies’ about things that should absolutely never be considered up for debate.
Sure would be nice, but you can't expect years of conditioning and learning to go away so fast, unfortunately.
[deleted]
Actually, people do say, ""But how can you be nonbinary when you look masc?!"" I'm AFAB, and everyone calls me a transgender male, even though I'm enby.
I've seen masc-presenting people say they've been excluded from LGBTQ+ spaces for being too masculine, or told they're too masc to be non-binary, especially when they're newly out 😥
I fucking love that
I totally, agree with you. I simply hate when I can go shopping for most of my clothes in the men's section and have shorter hair than my brother. And still, people tell me If you're Non-binary why do you wear a blouse (that is a shirt from the men's section)? Why don't you always have a flat chest? Why don't you start a screaming match every time someone uses a gendered word for you, if you say it doesn't describe you? And why do you have to tarnish my language with a ""gender-*"" (pretty much the best option I have since my language has no they/them, pretty much the same debate as well) when revering to yourself? It simply is exhausting. I don't have the energy to fight every little battle at once. Because you don't deserve the hate I feel toward myself afterward. For still not looking enough like I feel inside. For you not seeing the efforts I make to make it easier for you to see past this shell, and see me for who I am inside. For not fighting harder against restrictions that cage me, because you are scared of them falling. Of opening up more possibilities than you personally knew what to do with. If I scream, you are annoyed at the noise I'm making. If I stay silent, you use it to put me down. So just leave me alone would you? 

Sorry that turned into a rant, and is obviously not aimed at anyone here, just feels good to get it out there.
I’m sorry this reminded me of the tictok sound and I have to say we do owe them a little dance or a jig
EXACTLY. I feel the same. Stuff is pointlessly gendered nowadays and it’s ridiculous. We should just let people enjoy what they want to enjoy.
On point.
Isn’t combining fem and masc outfits dressing andro unless you just mean switching between the two in witch case my bad
Exactly!
Yes, good for you, but please keep in mind this is my rant post and it isn’t about you :) I don’t mean to be rude but the comment was unappreciated even if you had good intentions.
I should have said people don't say it to me. Sorry though, that's so frustrating 😔🤗
Regardless of our AGAB and expression, society loves to invalidate us. I wish people could just be chill and not get all investigatory.
Legit thought best friend refers to my chosen name as my trans guy name even though I chose a neutral name
It certainly makes me nervous about attending women and nonbinary events.
Oof
Not mine but I can't remember who said it. They even had a little jingle.
I love that TikTok sound 😭 I’m also a fan of that one tweet thread that’s like “Non-binary do not owe you androgyny” “No but one does owe me money”
Yea I like to switch between the two. I think it's kinda limiting to always be 50/50 ya know so I like to lean heavily into one side while still making it somewhat andro.
That would be miserable 4 me especially being AMAB I already try to get as femme/nb as possible to pass. That must SUCK
Even when I’m femme I’m still a them, even when I’m femme I’m still a them, I’m a they either way, no matter what the day, even when I’m femme I’m still a them! (Haha I memorized it, it’s from tik tok)

Your name is great. I’m planning on buying a pair of leggings I’ve wanted for a while but been too scared to actually wear, so I consider it a big step!
Haha haha don’t stress?? I don’t stress. What are you talking about?? But seriously, thank you for your support, it means a lot.
Thank you! I’m honestly fashion blind, my roommates told me they matched and I went with it.
Love American eagle!! All my clothes are from there pretty much
Honestly that’s been the hardest part for me. I mostly like the way I look but I also wish fully that I had been born looking different, and I have no control over it but getting past that is still my biggest struggle

Thank you!! My experience with hrt has been surprising and affirming, there were a lot of things and changes that I initially blew off as ppl manifesting or something something placebo but I’ve been shocked by how much and how silly some of the changes have been. Like I read about people claiming to get shorter or experiencing their sense of smell differently and I thought well surely that’s not true? But uh no they’re both true haha, a lot has changed.. I honestly love all the changes though! And no, I’m not microdosing-if anything I’m macrodosing haha-my regimen is actually a bit more than my trans friend’s but idk, I just appreciate the effects a lot and have read quite a bit of medical literature regarding dosing, hormones and outcomes as well as ancillary anecdotal arguments that support my dose and cycles. :-)
I've been thinking of doing light facial surgery
Awe *c:* tysmmm!! femby gang femby gang

Owo
It really is amazing, I expected the cheeks and lips to change a bit from the increase in fatty tissues and water retention on HRT but the eye changes were so unexpected!! I like it a lot :3 I used to always get told I looked stoned because my eyes were almost always more almond shaped like I was tired but now I get the opposite! I got big ole bug eyes now OvO I’ve read that this can happen due to the increased volume in *face flesh* (lol) from ‘the fattening’ of the face, my guess is that the pressure from all the new fat formed around the eyes pulls em in every which way and thus a lot of ppl on E report that their eyes seem to be more ‘open’ and generally larger. Some of the other changes I’ve experienced are less noticeable in these two pictures since I had makeup on in the first and none in the second~* I’m really happy :)
awe so like my end goal is to become the physical manifestation of basil from omori but with an extra hint of femme, which is pretty close to your description x3 thank you!!
But if you’re afraid of breast development definitely look into microdosing, I personally don’t mind them too much but I have been surprised by their growth cause uh, well my mom’s are already smaller and that was a surprise.. so yeah, if that’s an issue I’d consider just using anti-androgens normally and maybe microdosing E and just swallowing pills? I think my development is somewhat atypical going off of the trans friends I have but ymmv!
Me too, while I'm overall happy with the effects I've experienced thus far.. hrt is not gonna rid me of my adam's apple or big ole nose.. thankfully ffs is covered by my insurance and I'm scheduled for december! \^-\^ hope you can find a surgeon and plan that's right for you n\_n
Aww you know it i love it so much
Also appreciate the name! When thinking about names I also peeped through the champions list! xD although my surname is actually Fortune so Sarah was off the table haha!!
UGHUGHFHFHFHFHFH I JUST FINISHED OMORI A FEW DAYS AGO and I absolutely love Basil ;-; you already have the cute factor going!!! Sending good vibes and self love :)
I just had to drop one letter to find my new name! x3 The league reference was just cause I think it’s cuter with the e :3
ITS SO GOOD OMG!!! we so stan basil\*boi\* hahaha I cosplayed as \*them\* last halloween and posted it on the omori sub, feel free to peep my post history if ya wanna see :3 good vibes and lotsa self love to you too\~\~"	wwbp8e	NonBinary	334	1.0	2022-08-24 06:12:00

Been struggling with my identity lately, but now I am starting to realize I don’t really fit in the gender binary and loving it. Wish I had more opportunities to present femme.		"I like the left but,,, maybe no tie? That's my input you look great
Wow that is some madly sexy hair. 
I have the same button down! I love it because it definitely mixes some femm into my masculine style. 
Cute in both pics. Please tell me where you got that wig, it looks amazing 😍
Get earrings! They helped me a lot :) 
Thank you! I love ties and bow ties also!
Omg thank you 😭
It is great!
Where did you get it? I want one lol
Thank you so much! I got it on Amazon! Might get another one too!

And does it look as real in the real world as it does in the picture? Because if so, pleeease send me the link? I've ordered wigs before but they always looked obviously fake.
Also is that a wig in the second pic? It looks super nice :) 
I haven’t been able to wear it out but when I send pics to my friends they say it looks real. I think it does too! Just gotta take good care of it

AFAB, unsure of my gender identity but I recently shaved my head and have been getting into menswear. I’m really enjoying it and NB feels about right.		"I love your outfit!
Lookin snazzy!
Hawt
Dude, you look good in that. <3
nothing beats the feeling and freedom of a freshly shaved head. my hair is getting pretty damaged, i might be joining you on that one soon ! you look great :) 
*z snap* yaaaaaas m'theydey, you look great
Unf! Looks damn good too! I'm happy you're enjoying your exploration! 
I'm loving the shirts behind you as well! You look so good!!
I feel ya. I shaved my head last June and it really helped me get out of that feminine mold and begin to allow myself to explore really being nb, like dressing masculine and actually looking like a male. 
Awesome!
I love those jeans, they fit you really well, and I love the shaved hair as well! I've also recently started wearing men's clothes I always struggle buying mens trousers/jeans because of my hips and bum and short legs, but I hate the style of women's jeans. 
Noice!
Your story reminds me of my own. But I never looked that good. Keep rocking, sib!
I love my shaved head
Totally suits you! I haven’t had a shaved head in over ten years and I kinda miss it.

Was completely dismissed because I'm AMAB and more Masculine presenting...	"So a quick thing about me is I enjoy films, a lot, I enjoy critique, I enjoy the writing in films and love singing a good films praises as much as I love being critical and picking apart a bad film. 

But recently in a rather tame - not heated at all - discussion at a bar I was discussing a newly released film with 3 other friends and one was providing a few counter arguments and we had a  back and forth. Two others that were outside of this argument but at the table included another friend and my partner. The other friend said to my partner ""Men and their films.."" directed at me and after my partner said how I was nonbinary - which im sure they already knew - and just passionate about films and enjoy the discussion, the friend said ""oh I thought they were just some straight man who thinks they can just explain why their opinion is right and is gonna start talking over people - yknow like how stereotypical straight men get about films"".

Hearing about this after getting in and me sitting with it for a while I just start to think, why is it just because when people look at me and immediately see *man* they dismiss and invalidate my opinions but as soon as they learn my gender identity, what i said previously suddenly has the merit it deserves. My gender and perceived gender shouldn't f*cking interfere with how seriously my argument is taken. Im fucking good at constructing points and just want to be taken as such, not have people use some weird subjective filter of whether I look gender neutral enough for them to hear me out or not. My gender and sexuality for that matter shouldnt influence how seriously I am taken, the most infuriating thing is that this person was also LGBT so its like what??? I guess I just dont look gay or nb enough..."	"I’m really mad on your behalf; even if this person had correctly gendered you, they still assumed you were straight??? Way to assume fucking *everything*, pal! 

I get this too with having dared used my uterus. So feminists have been working to untangle maternity as a requirement for womanhood for generations, but I choose to bear kids and I *have* to be a “woman”? Fuck that!
I am really sorry that happened to you, that is super frustrating. I definitely think that there is a cognitive dissonance for a lot of people around gender where they can say that they see you one way, but their socialization leads them to think and act out of step with that. Not to excuse that behavior, because jeez that’s really invalidating and hostile. I hope that you are able to have do something for self care or self affirmation after this. 🖤💜🤍💛
This person talking to your partner was out of line. This doesn't reflect on you one bit, so I wouldn't take it personally or blame yourself for not looking gay or enby enough. That person has a problem for sure
I hear your frustration, and this person was completely out of pocket for saying all this bullshit. It was presumptuous, and when corrected, they absolutely did not need to double down.

That being said, I think it’s important to acknowledge that most of society treats women, femmes, and visibly trans people like this *almost all the time.* As ~~cis-passing~~ (EDIT: cis-assumed; see comment below) enbies, we have to acknowledge the privilege we have. So while your frustration is valid, I want to put it on the table that this is not just an issue that impacts you, but also every person who is not a cis and/or cis-passing man—and it may well impact a lot of them a lot more often. So I just hope we can have compassion and solidarity for that.

All the best to you, and I hope this person learns better. They were being really gross and invalidating, and it’s such a shame that this attitude is not uncommon in the LGBTQ community.
I have this happen to me a lot (also AMAB and more masc presenting). It’s to a point that I feel obligated to use he/him in conjunction with they/them even though I don’t want to, because if I didn’t people would just be constantly misgendering me. It’s really frustrating that everyone just assumes that just because I’m AMAB that I must identify with my sex assigned to me at birth. Stay strong friend, and know you aren’t alone.
She’s an asshole. I’m sorry that you had to interact with someone who thinks that revenge misandry is acceptable. Being offensive towards whoever’s gender identity man, non binary, woman, etc is not ok. 

I thought these people only exist on Reddit and Twitter but I guess they leak over into real life and just think saying offensive shit about all men/masc people is ok because “I’m oppressed” 

To all the masc non binary people you are valid. Don’t let assholes like this create a narrative about you in your heads.
i hate that casual/joking jabs at men (and ""men"", yay for misgendering) have become so much the norm in queer communities... i thought the value of these comments was in using the reversal to show how ridiculous ANY kind of gender stereotyping is? (and in some cases, to prompt the critical examination of men's behavior in ways neglected by the patriarchy, in order to hold men accountable for any bad behaviors they've been previously not called out on *if and when they're actually happening*)

...but a disturbing number of people seem to be just... genuinely buying into it? 

and like... just glossing over all the women and nonbinary people hurt by it being misapplied to them, and all the trans men who get to enjoy their gender affirmation in the form of denigration (or who get told it doesn't apply to them, bc they're not REALLY men)... cis men don't deserve that either. they should hear these things once or twice, explicitly as a joke, just to make them think about what the experience is like for other genders who get it all the time (and obviously they should be aware of common patterns of bad behavior the patriarchy encourages in men, so they can check themself and their peers for any way they may be unwitting playing into that, and called out when others see them doing it), but no one should have to deal with that. 

how sad is it that cis men to have to choose between a misogynistic/patriarchal culture they don't believe in, and a culture free all of that, but in which they personally are denigrated/put down/othered? like where are cis men supposed to be able to have genuine connection with people other than cis men? 

but honestly more than any of that, it's just stupid. 
existing wrongness isn't going to be combatted by being wrong in the other direction. misogyny and misandry are both built on the same faulty premise, and playing into either just further legitimizes and strengthens that shared foundation of sexism.
That's what we get for rapresenting men as ""enemy"", demonizing every form of masculinity in the attempt to smash social structures.

It's very sad and i'm really sorry for you.
Ah, gotta love the combination of misandry and enbiephobia

As a fellow masc nb who shares your passion for film, I feel your frustration
I once had someone accept my enbyness… and 2 days later in a discussion accused me of “all of you   guys are like that. Sorry I know you said you’re nb, but you still have a dick”

fastest unfriend/unmatch/seeyanever ever

op, stupid people being stupiding, don’t let it get you down :)
[removed]
That's messed up!
That person sounds like a jerk with a very fixed mindset and not enough compassion.
I understand your frustration, but...

>My gender and perceived gender shouldn't f*cking interfere with how seriously my argument is taken.

Is this not frequently the experience of many women?
>  talking over people

*If* this is a thing that actually happened, it's something to work on - just to be a better conversationalist, etc. 

Some people are taught, growing up, to be considerate of others and their feelings. To make sure they don't take up too much space or be too loud, and to make space and time for others' words and emotions. *Typically* that education is gendered, but it's not always; some people teach all their kids to be considerate; some teach none of their children this. 

Realizing that no one ever bothered to teach you how to be actually polite because it was assumed 1. you were a man and 2. men get to trample over everyone else in conversation really sucks. Moving into queer spaces will really help an individual mistaken for male realize how much space they've been told by society they are entitled to take up, and I mean that in conversation as well. 

So it's worth it to examine your behavior - regardless of gender stereotypes - and consider just what it that elicited that reaction. Someone being a jackass and calling you a straight man isn't the best way to let someone know that their behavior isn't cooperative, BUT statistically, it's actually quite possible that some aspect of your conversational habits might read as overconfident. You spent your life thinking that if you had something to say, it was worth being listened to, so of course there's space in any conversation for your thoughts! You bothered to have them, didn't you?  

I experienced a LOT of that (even as AFAB) due to my autism and not realizing that there *was* no space in conversation for my ideas (due to being mistaken for female), even though I expected to take up as much space in any discussion as anyone else who knew enough to participate. It was weird to get online and use a neutral name and be accused of mansplaining because I was confident and willing to hold my ground in a conversation. 

HOWEVER, there are three critical factors in mansplaining, beyond the person doing it being a dude:

1. it must be WRONG

2. it must be to someone who KNOWS that it's wrong - i.e., novice talking down to expert

3. it must be UNSOLICITED 

so if you're in a group convo talking about your opinions, instead of telling a physicist they don't know what stars are because you saw one in the sky once, it's pretty hard to actually be mansplaining - opinions are difficult to be ""wrong"" in the same way that mansplained material tends to be. 

So the specific term probably doesn't apply remotely and, rather than find an adult way to tell you she found it rude to be interrupted or talked over, she microaggressed and attacked your gender identity. I mean, what better way to cow someone into keeping quiet than to convince them their whole identity must be a lie if they don't?  

You're entitled to a whole person's worth of space! But you're only entitled to ONE person's worth of space. (like, socially/emotionally/verbally, not literally in a fatphobic way)  And which of those is more difficult for you to learn reflects a LOT about how you were raised, which in a binary culture can often involve what gender stereotypes were assigned to you as a child. 

(deep breath)

tl;dr: hard to mansplain if you're not a man and giving an opinion, buuuuuuut it might be time to consider your consideration of others in conversations.
I can understand if people have a negative reaction to something they may consider ""mansplaining"", even though you are not a man. if you spent any part of your life passing as masculine enough to be taught some of the ideals of the partriarchy theres a chance youve stumbled into it without knowing. I would say, confirm that the person you are speaking with feels that their opinion is valid even if there is a difference in your own. if thats the case then everyone else can shut it.
I can relate to this frustratingly well. I'm also amab, mostly masc presenting because any signifiers i ended up adopting would be for other folks, not for myself or how I'd like to present. This sometimes means that regardless of how long I've been out as non-binary I get accused of ""man-moding"" a lot. This usually comes from taking up space, in queer spaces.

The funny thing is, being raised as a man I was taught NOT to take up space, to be quiet and be small. It was all well meaning, but it meant i never really got to own myself or my body. I had to unlearn a lot of that behavior to actually figure out I was non-binary. I was less confrontational and annoying when I thought I was a man, so its a little funny when folks attribute that to my upbringing. You can call me insufferable, or annoying, but never call me a man for it.

I hear you and I agree with the sentiments of your post however I think that the term ""cis-assumed"" is a more intentional and accurate term instead of ""cis-passing"" because (at least to me) the term passing implies that there is a volitional intention to be seen as cis and it doesn't seem like this is what op is trying to do (indeed there are many trans folks who are trying to pass and are also valid). I agree that there is privilege in this (especially for people who are assumed male) but it's also important to hold space and accurately describe it in a way that honors the validity of their nonbinarity while still being aware of the privilege that comes from navigating society while being assumed in this context.
Thank you and yes I understand
this. all the way!
As a trans guy I'd actually disagree that society treats femme presenting and visibly trans people like this ""all the time"". There is certainly prejudice, and transphobia is extremely blatant and often violent. But I've never had my opinions, perspectives, and honestly humanity dismissed by society in the way that certain ""progressive"", LGBT+ people feel comfortable doing to me now, now that they assume I'm a straight, cis guy. There's a difference in tone and in that people feel *much* more entitled shitting on straight, cis men for the most part.

This is ofc, nothing on what transfem people go through just by being out in public. But I don't think we should lump *all* femme-presenting people and even trans people in with them. Femme cis women are not, for the most part, dismissed so blatantly and entirely where I am from at least. People might interrupt them more or respect them less, but they won't *blatantly* say ""she's a woman, she has no right to speak!"". It's not quite as violent saying that about men, ofc, as the other way round would be due to patriarchy and the power men hold in society. But it's still regressive and dehumanising. It's not something we should defend.
Its the comments like this reminding me im not the only one thats making it better. Thanks
Right there with you. I've had to constantly get on to my shift lead at my job and still he doesn't gender me properly. Constant sir's don't help because I work customer service in the south
I was at a queer event yesterday and my friends were joking that I was ""toxically masculine"" because I was drinking huel and dressed in conventionally masc attire.

I laughed. I took it. I chose to focus on the funny side and see that they are well intentioned, and that they don't *actually* believe I am a toxic person for drinking Huel or wearing sportsgear.

At the same time, it's not lost on me that every other gender expression is celebrated (in queer communities), while mine is mocked. That if I didn't have a sense of humour about it and actually voiced offence at those kinds of jokes, then I likely wouldn't have any friends. And that the masculinity which was beaten out of me (I'm AFAB) and that I've been shamed for my entire life... if I embrace it it's seen as a bit embarrassing and not something to be celebrated - even in queer spaces.
Amab enbies amongst other groups like trans men and bi men take the grunt of that. Way to smash them social structures everyone, really doing the work... /s
I appreciate the energy but let's not throw hands. Thank you for the support!
Yes but as I do not do that (so there's no element of hypocrisy) how is it relevant to this rant post? I'm not saying it only happened to me for being nonbinary (although that was a major factor), I'm just stating that it did happen.
like... yeah. everyone needs to watch out for toxic behavior in themself. 

but even if OP was definitely 100% talking over people, it's still a valid complaint that their friend decided to misgender them about it instead of just being like ""hey, stop talking over me"" 

maybe OP was in the wrong — idk, i wasn't there — but their AGAB and presentation were obviously a factor in the way they were confronted about it (to the extent that their friend lead with the misgendering, and only mentioned their actual supposed grievance as an afterthought, to underline the initial misgendering) 

i interpret your first comment as well-meaning, but i don't think it's evidence of OP not knowing how to be considerate in conversation that they were dismissive of a comment that was 80% unsoliciced Self-Examination 101 and 20% acknowledging the other person's bad behavior, with a TLDR that reads basically like ""Have you considered that they're right?""
[removed]
I know how to have a fair discussion. I know how to give others room to talk and know how to watch my tone and language. Please do not assume I dont because I grew up with a male raising..
Yes, transitioning isn’t easy, and if it doesn’t come with unlearning certain behaviours then you’re just preserving privilege
[removed]
[removed]
I actually love this. It’s a much more comfortable phrase for sure, for both me and OP. Thank you for pointing it out 💖
I will add that having privilege does not at all reflect on the person who has it; what would would be what that person does with the privilege. Privilege is also based on other people’s assumptions.
Thank you for sharing your experience
I don't wanna imply that it's ""worse"" for me than it is for amab enbies or bi men, but what really bothers me in my case as a trans masc is that I was literally *abused* for my masculinity growing up, as a kid. People hated it and taught me it made me ugly, and treated me like absolute dirt cos I dared to be masculine as an afab. And now, in a community of people who should understand what that's like and want me to be me and be celebrated for it, who I am is treated as *dirty* and like something to be ashamed of. It's fucking shit.
I think the point is that when you say ""My gender and perceived gender shouldn't fcking interfere with how seriously my argument is taken.""  you're absolutely correct, but it's something you always got to take for granted when society was mistaking you for a man, and saying it to people who never got to believe the lie feels a little tone deaf. Getting to be oblivious to sexism is in and of itself a privilege that non-men do not have, so the further you move from everyone else automatically treating you like the dude they (falsely) think they see, the more you'll be *experiencing* sexism instead of simply observing it. And the new angle on toxic masculinity is *enlightening* to say the least.
There's no way to deserve transphobia.
Transitioning mtf or mtx and wanting others to recognise that has to come with unlearning certain behaviours that come from preserving privilege, it’s not disgusting to realise that
> is gonna start talking over people

This is what made me assume you might be, well. ... Talking over people. The education of being considerate is *often* gendered but not always. Every cis binary man should also learn every bit of How Not To Be A Dick In Conversation - it's not a new standard just cos you came out as enby. 

If someone felt talked over, then it's time to examine what caused that. Don't get defensive and trapped in cognitive dissonance. Anyone can interrupt, not just men. But anyone can learn to be more polite, too. Improve yourself! It's honestly never a waste, even when you think you're already perfect.

Tone isn't always a problem - I get really enthusiastic and people often mistake it for aggression. You don't have to be nice to be right OR righteous. But you do have to be nice if you want friends. Whether or not you want to be friends with some turd who talks about you like that is obviously up for debate BUT for someone who WOULDN'T speak to you so cruelly, wouldn't you want to make sure they also felt comfortable in a conversation? Consideration is about, well. Considering others, not necessarily before yourself, but at least thinking, gee, how will this affect anyone but me?
> I know how to have a fair discussion. I know how to give others room to talk and know how to watch my tone and language

But you're not. You're just denying anyone and shutting down the advice that you have something to work on. Your defensiveness is preventing you from dealing with the possibility that you were rude because you can blame it on someone calling you too masc instead. It really doesn't matter why you were rude or what upbringing convinced you that talking over someone ISN'T rude; if you treat people that way in conversation, you can say you're fair all you want and it won't change the precedent of what you actually **do**.
I'm not agreeing with the term, but I guarantee that there was a reason why people were getting annoyed. Saying that someone has habits to work on isn't misgendering them. Literally every time I've heard a trans or nonbinary person (whether AFAB or amab) complain that someone said they were mansplaining they were in fact talking in a condescending way and over others. Call me a. Asahole all you want, but when you remove the gender there is still an incredibly irritating behavior underneath that yes, constantly being reinforced by society because they are amab and masc presenting. Pointing out that there is a reason why others are bothered isn't ennyphobic. .not sure how many embys you actually know but they are just as likely to have gross behavior as cis people,and the fact that OP dismissed the criticism because of the term really confirms this.lol you can criticize behavior without criticising someone's identity and it's bullahit you think that embys are immune to this
I said ""viewed as a man"" because you did in your post. My comment is regarding how you automatically dismissed someone's criticism without even considering it.
Masculinity is rapresented as ugly from much of the last wave of feminism.

People keep saying ugly sh*t like ""men are rapist"" instead of ""those SPECIFIC men are rapist"" or even worse, they talk about patriarchy as something enforced by men, while it's a social structure enforced by women too.

The concept of privilege also points out toward this direction, rapresenting men as people without responsabilities, while they also have gender roles and such.

I notice this attitude with me too. When people finds me more feminine they act better toward me, while they are much less kind if they see the ""manly"" part first.
I live in an area where the two main demographics is religions that hate homosexuality. And unfortunately as much as I'm not gay appearing enough for other LGBT members, my dyed hair and painted nails often gets me dismissed and looked over in society, at work, or just in a social setting. Too gay for the straights, too straight-looking for the gays. Thus is the life of a amab bi enby. Dismissed by fucking everyone let's go lads.
Thank you

Much better expressed than I managed.
There is no such thing as a specific goal for transition for non-binary people. Masc-presenting non-binary people who happen to be AMAB are still non-binary. Androgyny or otherwise non-masc presentation may be a goal for some, but is not for all. No non-binary person is obligated to transition to anything, because non-binary doesn’t have a fixed presentation. 

And even if it did, unlearning something for the sake of transition implies that whatever is to be unlearned is somehow an innate trait of whatever is being transitioned from. **It behooves any and ALL genders to unlearn patriarchally-mandated attitudes, behaviors, and notions of gender.** Even cis women at all points of intersection still have to do the work to unlearn attitudes and behaviors that reinforce patriarchal structures.

This attitude that AMAB people are the only ones who have to change to dismantle the multi-dimensional systems of power is suspiciously bio-essentialist and TERFy.
This seems a little ableist to me, don’t you think? “Anyone can learn to be polite” as a neurodivergent enby with a late adhd diagnosis I’ve really really struggled with the self hate of always accidentally interrupting or talking over my friends and feeling like a piece of garbage for not being able to shut up. This resulted in me completely shutting down and only having one friend at a time. Luckily now I know I wasn’t just an asshole all the time but I had adhd which made it really hard for me not to interrupt. It seems as though you yourself are making a lot of assumptions on your end. 

I willing to bet OP is coming off as defensive to you because you sound like you’re attacking them. Readjust your approach and learn to be polite since that seems to be a thing that everyone can learn.

I am. Youre just assuming I wasn't. Actually just you, im arguing with you, I dont mind other people's points because they haven't constructed this false narrative of me, I know I need work, everyone does. I wasn't being rude, my partner is very good at telling me when my autism makes me forget my tone and I come across as rude and he fully said to me I was fine that night. I wasn't talking over anyone. You keep creating a quote, I never said I talked over anyone, I give everyone room to speak, I enjoy discussion, its fun. Its fun to be challenged and exchange views.
None of us were there in that conversation. Yet all I hear from randoms is that ‘maybe OP should check their behavior and stop acting like a cis man’

You’re playing devils advocate of a person being intentionally offensive to OP and it just shows that you don’t give a shit and you’re just using this opportunity to shit on a masc person because you think that’s ok. If this was a fem person no one would’ve said a god damn word about OP “talking over” someone else. You assume just because OP was born with a penis that they were in the wrong and being inconsiderate in that conversation. 

You’re a transphobe.
>  gay appearing enough 

What is 'gay appearing' ? Is it supposed to signify your gender or your sexual orientation?
I Never said they’re the only ones, that’s just who we were talking about right now, I agree that everyone shares this responsibility. it’s ridiculous to pretend you weren’t socialised in some way if you spent any amount of your life being seen or forced to act as a certain gender, and its something any trans person has to come to terms with, that’s all I’m saying. I also never mentioned a specific goal but OP clearly doesn’t want to be misgendered, while feeling entitled to male-coded behaviour that’s been taught throughout our lives, and there’s nothing bio essentialist about that
It's not. Learning is different for everyone, but it's always possible. It's much more ableist to pretend that needing to be taught clearly (rather than absorb it implicitly) is the same as being unable to learn. It takes more effort and more work for those of us on the spectrum, but it's hardly impossible.
If someone literally said you were talking over others, then denying it out of ego isn't going to do a damn thing for you.
Quote came from your post, not 'created'. 

You can say that you do that all you want but you keep just denying/dismissing. Doesn't matter how fair you claim to be if you're only ""fair"" to what you haven't already decided to ignore.
I specified that I have seen this with both AFAB and amab people so you're 100% making things up when you say that I'm assuming things because someone was""born with a penis"". I'm assuming that the person who was complaining about a behavior was in favor complaining about a behavior. Weird move calling a trans person who has been hospitalized for being assaulted for being trans a transphobe and will undoubtedly face medical transphobia for the rest of their life but you do you.

I'm sorry but that's just not true, there are many who dress themselves well - or don't - y'know, like *any other* sexuality.
Your attitude is completely unacceptable. Grow up and try again.

"""I don't care if you identify as anything else, to me everyone is either a 'he' or 'she'"""	"Just heard this from a coworker. I'm (31) in the closet, haven't told anyone I'm nonbinary, and I feel a bit like crying. I've just been married, and have been showing everyone at work my wedding photos (it was an amazing day but I look quite femme so have been getting 'princess' and 'beautiful woman' comments), and I know that when they look at me, they see a woman, and it makes me just feel like there's no hope for anyone seeing me otherwise.

We were talking (separate conversation) at lunch about mental health when the above was said. I was going to talk about how it's the smallest kindness you can offer someone, to respect their pronouns and their identity, and it makes such a huge difference, but the words wouldn't leave my mouth and I ended up just sitting there and listening to them talk about it together like being nonbinary was this new thing and linked up with mental illness.

Just looking for consolation, I guess. I know I'm not likely to ever change their mind, but it's just a real hit of reality that if I were to come out they wouldn't respect or understand me."	"First of all, you don't owe anything to anybody. You do and say what you're comfortable with.  You don't have to fight every fight, or any fight for that matter, to be valid. 

We'll never please or convince everybody to respect us. Focusing your energy on the worst if the worst isn't worth it.  If he continues making you uncomfortable though, you could ask HR, if you trust them.
Don't beat yourself up over not being able to say your piece in that situation. Not only were they in the wrong for saying that, but it's not your responsibility to educate, counter, or shut down that sort of attack. The responsibility for that lies with the bigot themselves, or another person at the table that is also a member of the bigot's in-group. It has a lot more impact if it's coming from someone they expect to back them up.

Depending on your employer 's policies, you may be able to file a hostile workplace claim and have it addressed directly by corporate.

Similar things have happened to me where I shut down in the moment. I've come to realize that my mind will always come up with the perfect thing to say...24 hours later. Never when I need it in the moment.

Not helpful, brain.

>Just looking for consolation, I guess. I know I'm not likely to ever change their mind, but it's just a real hit of reality that if I were to come out they wouldn't respect or understand me.


A big component of how minds change with regards to acceptance or comfort level is how much casual/regular exposure the individual has had to the concept that makes them uncomfortable. The more exposure opportunities they have that *don't* fulfill their negative expectations, the more desensitized they become to it. Right now, Non-binary is a new concept to many. They don't understand it, and the primary thing they've been told about enbies is probably something like ""they're really sensitive about pronouns"". 

I'd speculate that this person doesn't know any (out of the closet) enbies. They thought they were in a safe space for that sort of bigotry, so they said what they said assuming they wouldn't be contradicted. Had they known how you identify, and then said that, it might have been perceived as antagonistic towards you by the rest of the group. 

All that being said, you should only come out when it's safe, and in a manner and timeframe that suits your needs.
what a ridiculous notion that they somehow have the right to make that choice. Does this theory then also allow you the right to choose their pronouns for them? If all these fools were misgendered on purpose, as they enjoy doing, they would likely jump to defend their own pronouns. I see you, and you are valid.
Damn, a quick ""I'm nonbinary"" with a flat affect and a blank staredown would have been amazing during that convo. Sorry you missed that opportunity to put that shitty feeling awkwardness right back on them. Next time!
I understand that you didn't have the spoons for it, but when you can, it's important to cultivate the ability to stand up when you hear these things. I've had a few occasions of people being against queer, nonbinary, trans, even gay people (still, somehow, in Canada) and there has yet to be a time that I've politely said, just flat out, ""I'm nonbinary. I don't identify as a man or a woman :) "" that they haven't done a double take and apologized.

Most of the time people say this shit because they don't know anyone whom it affects. Change that <3
Sounds like someone should be called using the wrong pronouns for a month, maybe they'll learn to shut the fuck up.

&#x200B;

In any case, it's 100% ok to not always feel comfortable defending this position. That doesn't mean you're not doing the right thing, it's a simple matter of stake. Your coworker saying some ill-advised bullshit about gender has essentially no effect on them, while you willfully standing up for yourself would put you at a disadvantage. That's why it's so easy for dickheads to hate on everyone, they are emotionally indifferent to the matter.
I fully understand this, as an adult that works with many phobic people, they don't like binary trans people already so anything off the binary is just way to much for them to even try and comprehend. 

I know without a doubt if I came out the gendering would become aggressively female, so I just stay closeted because I'll be misgendered regardless but at least they don't know they are actively doing it. 

Do know that chances are that there's probably at least one other queer person where you work unless it's a small team. 
They may not be queer in a gender way but there are many people out there that have some tie to LGBTQ. 

I'm sorry so many people don't understand trans / nonbinary experience or even attempt to learn and grow. 

You are yourself no matter what people call you, on the inside you are a non-binary person.
Goddang, that's one of the most disrespectful things I've ever heard someone say. I'm sorry that you had to deal with this at work. To me, anyone who says something like that is extremely selfish and lacks respect or care for others. Of course I can't really tell to pay them no mind because that doesn't always help, but unfortunately, I can't tell you anything else other than ""that person is a dick."" If you feel comfortable, I would recommend talking to HR or your boss or whoever handles things like this, because that behaviour is certainly not appropriate for the workplace.
Fuck those people. They’re shitty people with shitty opinions.
So much love to you… you are valid and i so understand the feeling♥️🫂
I'd report this to HR for transphobia tbh. Especially reading that y'all work with kids, younger generations are more and more open about gender and she's a danger to have the potential of working with queer kiddos
They sound like a complete prick, how fucking ignorant can someone be?

I'm sorry you had to sit and listen to that, I've been in similar situations and it's always really shitty. The realisation that a person you would consider your friend is a massive douche can hurt so much, I can relate to the feeling.

Don't beat yourself up over not being able to voice your thoughts either, it's easy for people to say 'well you should've said this' but in the moment it's really difficult to speak up (not to mention potentially dangerous in some cases). Take care of yourself first and don't feel pressured to confront them about it or anything if you don't want to. 

(although if they continue to make you uncomfortable taking it up with HR might be an idea.)
""I dont care about your made up hippie dippie nonsense. There are only 7 colors. You can call that brown all you want but youre wrong and im right and i think im super smart bc im refusing to acknowledge that brown is a color""

Probably not very helpful but i just cant take people like that seriously. I either will just tune them out and avoid, or mock them to their face (if its somewhere where i can do that without like... being fired)
Well, now we know your coworker identifies as a piece of shit.
I *hate* this kind of shit. I'm a still-mostly-in-the-closet enby too (I'm out to my husband and a handful of friends) and these kind of comments make me die a bit inside too. Knowing how some people basically don't see us as valid human beings makes it even harder to ever come fully out.

If you do hugs, I have one for you *hug*
Hi friend! Congratulations on your marriage!

Your feelings are completely valid. It's normal to be saddened by other people's misunderstanding. If this is someone you have a good relationship with and respect, you may consider sharing your feelings honestly after you've had a moment to compose yourself. 

On the other hand, some people legitimately believe our Earth is flat. We can't change their mind. If they don't pose a serious threat, just internally acknowledge the absurdity of the situation and carry on with life, I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

Good luck and remember you're a valid human, no gender required!
Hello! I think others in the comments have said pretty much what I wanted to convey, so I'll just say that I'm sending you strength and courage to deal with this situation. I'm sorry that you had to be in that situation and hear all of that nonsense. 

And I hope that your workers will go on to understand and learn that us non binary people aren't what they think us to be, and even if they don't, that's not on you. Sending you tons of love, you and your emotions are valid. May you have a better weekend!
Well that's kind of what dimorphism is... Whether you're male, female or ""male in origin"", ""female in origin"" is important to an enormous number of people and professionals and is extremely important (and relevant) to medical treatment and organization...

The explanation is a quick google search away but, for the sake of commenting, dimorphism is where (in animals and humans) sex and size are directly correlated (e.g. men are larger with a narrow pelvis broad shoulders, women are smaller with a wider pelvis, narrow shoulders). Non-dimorphism is any scenario wherein dimorphism does not actually apply (e.g. when a women is taller than most men, a man shorter than most women, a man with a wide pelvis, a woman with a narrow pelvis, etc. ...), something which is technically typical in humans and uncommon in animals. 

They're not antagonizing the system for the sake of exclusion - the categorization of this community isn't something they agree with as a point of it being, for all intents and purposes, bureaucratically ineffective.
So from my knowledge gender disforua  is a thing. However like depression or a sugar addiction. It doesn’t define you. Sure you get depressed sometimes or you are just miserable if you don’t have your sugar. But also you get miserable if you can’t identify and project to the world they way you want to. Honestly I think it’s fucked that anything that IS NOT the status quo could be linked to one mental illness or another. If something makes you happy and you can remain healthy with it then there’s nothing to treat. It’s all this black and white thinking in society today. I’m gender nonconforming or non-binary depending on the day so I know how you feel.
Im a they for ME. I present masculine and accept being referred to as male so long as it does not confer or imply privilege in the context.  

Let assholes be assholes let them identify themselves as an asshole how they choose to.  Set your boundries and respect yourself enough to enforce them without expecting other people to change and conform to your expectations.

Because that is what you are asking from them.
This isn't on you, this is on employees having an inappropriate conversation for the workplace. Those are opinions that shouldn't be expressed in that sort of environment (or any really but especially there). It's discriminatory and grounds for reporting to HR. Which is not your responsibility, I'm just saying that this was workplace discrimination. 

I'm so sorry that happened. Work should be a safe space.
Younger person here (not necessarily nb) with multiple nb teachers, one of them AFAB and wore both a tux and dress for their wedding. I still see them as nb. I know its not a lot, especially from someone not around your age group, but maybe it is comforting to know that there are people who will simply appreciate the beauty of your wedding and what you wore while not relating it to a binary gender. <3
Thank you. I've heard similar things said by other coworkers (mainly those in the 40 to 60 year old age range), but I consider this person a friend so it hurts knowing how they really feel. It worries me a little, as we work with kids and I hate the idea of a kid being treated badly for who they are.

Still working on not needing to be accepted by or needing approval from the people around me. It's a long journey.
Hello! I'm not OP and I know this is not directed at me, but it's very nice to hear this. Needed to see this today, thank you
Thank you ❤️ as an aside, ""I see you"" was a part of my fiancé's vows at our wedding, and hearing it on a day where I was dressed and presenting very femme meant so much. I don't really understand why people have difficulty conceiving of genders outside of 'male' and 'female' - it's not new, there are quite a lot of cultures out there that acknowledge amd celebrate more than two genders.

Thinking about this more, when trans people have been brought up in the past in discussion, my coworkers seem to understand and have respect for binary trans people, but not non binary or gnc trans people.

Thanks again for your comment, I really appreciate it
Knowing her, that would have been met with an equally blank stare and either a ""and what does that mean?"" or ""so you don't think you're a woman"" or some shit.

Honestly, I'm feeling like typing that out, maybe she's not a great 'friend' lol
Thank you - I was thinking the same. I will try to speak up next time.
I’m in a similar situation - out to my husband a few friends, and just…completely resonate with what you’re saying.  It’s so hard to come out completely when people are so ghastly about our very existence.  I own my own business, and work closely with strangers often, so it would be…very difficult for me to remain successful in what I do if I publicly came out😓  
Sending big hugs to you🫶🏽💚
I'm struggling to understand how your comment relates to my post. I work in a medical field, but the sex of a patient is irrelevant to treatment and isn't even recorded for patients - only the gender they identify as. I didn't mention that though, so I'm still confused about why you feel dimorphism relates to the situation I posted about. 

I think she's incredibly stubborn, doesn't want to learn, and doesn't realise how hurtful being misgendered is for people. At least, I hope she doesn't realise. She's quite churchy, and while she isn't the most traditional person, she doesn't like things she doesn't understand. But like I said, she's also stubborn and doesn't seem to want to learn. I feel that's more the issue here than dimorphism.
I can't help but notice your name.  Are you an electrician?  I say you're good for about 50 amps, or 40 if you're in a cable 🤔🤣
Not sure if you're a teacher / aide at a school, but if you are I'd still say to try your best to gender the kids as how they want. 
I understand that coworkers can be a pain with this. 
As a teachers aide myself I wouldn't change a thing on how I respect our children here when it comes to gender identity, yes I get crap from people but that kid will never forget the person who listened, and possibly the only person who would respect them. 

I've helped a few kids out while working at school, and they seem so much mentally better just knowing there's at least one person who will listen. 

I'd definitely say treat them how you want to be treated yourself.
some folks are slow to accept new things. trans info has finally been around long enough that the average person now has a framework to understand them. that makes it easier to accept them. non-binary stuff is harder (for them) because it's nuanced and they can't just look at someone and assume their gender, and that's embarrassing. but rather than owning they need to change, they'd rather just invalidate and complain.
sounds like this just brought to light the red flags you've been missing up to this point!
>... ""to me everyone is either a 'he' or 'she' 

my point was that there is legitimate rhetoric to that notion and a basis of foundation in the science which regards the notion as ""correct"", be that something which is described by outdated vernacular or otherwise - the ultimate result pursued by the demographic is to be something which *is* either ""male"" or ""female"", correct? The result of all effort therein would regard a body identified within the demographic as being ""male"" or ""female"" in summary, be that in origin or otherwise... No?
I have 2 NBs. Both born male, I'll explain why this matters. The 16 yr old  is built like a warrior and 6f 4Inches. My 13yr old is almost 6ft and likewise built. The older is truly nonbinary/genderless. The younger is NB/Fem. Out in public it messes with people when they see these giants and think MALE! of course! And then see painted long nails, earrings, or in my youngests case, a sundress over pants. I have a trans niece as well who is over 6ft. So for us, everyone is a they/them until they tell us otherwise. And I would like to have a ..... talk ....

Normalizing trans and non binary going to the obgyn	"Today at the obgyn looking very gender neutral (except for the fact I'm very pregnant) and I noticed a ""gentleman"" sitting in the office. Ok Normal probably waiting for his woman. (I know not nice to assume) and the doctor calls them back. I'm just thinking to myself awesome they are getting the proper medical help they need dispute what others may think. Too many people won't go especially if they look more on the masculine side. (Which they did.) So good on those who don't care what others think and take care of themselves.

I do want to make an edit... I am not saying it's easy for trans and those who lean more towards the masculine side to go. Especially since so many places are non LGBT friendly. What I am saying is we need to normalize this. And more places need to be more excepting of the LGBT community. Especially since so many people are not getting the proper medical care they need. I am very happy that my doc is LGBT friendly they ask for pronouns, and gender identity, and are very respectful, unfortunately this is not the case with all places. It's not as easy for some to just get up and go to the OB/GYN But I hope one day it will be that easy in them."	"my obgyn had various gender options and asks your pronouns. really pleased that there seems to be a push toward this sort of thing.
I’m wondering when they will stop being called/advertised as a “Woman’s Health Clinic”.
Individuals and groups are trying very hard (I speak as part of one of those medical groups trying to change things!) 

For some top obs care check out brighton’s pregnancy service because it’s pretty great! https://www.bsuh.nhs.uk/documents/support-for-trans-and-non-binary-people-during-pregnancy-birth-and-the-postnatal-period/ 🙌🙌🙌
My doc is at a community health center that caters to lgbt folks and has ob/gyn / family doctors that can do all the stuff. Definitely would feel too weird going to one that wasn't explicitly lgbt friendly since I present more masculine and have facial hair and a deeper voice
This is very important, especially since going to an obgyn can be an extremely dysphoria inducing and possibly traumatic experience for many trans people. I know that it was not a great experience for me
I get my birth control from Planned Parenthood, and have been addressed by my preferred pronouns and name by most people working there. I was so relieved the last time I went and they called me they/them etc. However the actual doctor herself misgendered me and I found that really annoying. The rest of the staff was really cool though.
A very close friend of mine, a trans man, died of cervical cancer last year that wasn't caught til very late and his hysterectomy kept getting delayed because of covid restrictions. Trans men & dfab nonbinary folks frequently skip gyno visits because many reproductive health clinics are so heavily Woman branded, causing alienation and dysphoria.

Please please please get your pelvic exams, your pap smears, your gardisil shot, no matter if you have a girl pussy, boy pussy, or gender neutral pussy!

If you're unsure what provider offers good & gender neutral gyno care, I've had luck finding providers in my city's queer exchange Facebook group! Local queer sex toy shops may also have a community board you can check out.
My gyn clinic has been asking for pronouns as long as I've been going there >5 years. They also asked not so much about partner(s) gender as what I put in my orifices. I got the rec for this office from my radically inclusive feminist bicycling group.
For many people, not going isn't a simple matter of personal comfort, but that doctor's will sometimes cause more harm than good. Not every OB/GYN is trans friendly and finding one that is can be nearly impossible in some areas. There's countless stories of transmasculine people being misgendered and harassed at these clinics by staff and medical professionals. Receiving inadequate or flatout wrong care, and even being straightup denied the medical services they need. It can be extremely humiliating and traumatic on top on that. Framing this as an issue of ""transmasculine people just gotta go there"" completely ignores the real struggles and systemic barriers which exist for trans folks seeking healthcare.
yes I have gotten asked my pronouns and if I have a preferred name at most of my (many) dr's appointments in the last two years. it's been a significant increase and I'm glad to see it
Yeah, actually seeing this at more offices around as well, like my derm's intake form asked pronouns.
Mine is actually called a ""Reproductive Health Clinic."" Apart from the fact that they exclusively serve people with internal reproductive organs, there's nothing gendered about the environment at all. Even the reading material is for anyone at a doctor's office. They're paired with the"" Reproductive Health Clinic"" that my husband briefly used when we were tying to conceive, and it is set up almost exactly the same apart from being a different building (so slightly different layout.)

One of the many reasons I'd never live in a non-blue state.
Alot of places around where I live are just called obgyn clinic. Though I go to one specifically called woman's health specialist.
So… dumb question but… do you just ask the clinic or the doctor if they are LGBT friendly? I just moved to a new city and made an appointment with a family doctor as my new primary care provider. I’m a little worried about asking, you never know what the reaction will be.
I'm sorry to hear about your friends passing. This is exactly why more clinics need to be open to everyone. I just convinced my best friend of 16 years to go to the OB GYN. I spent so much time researching one that was trans friendly. Sending friendly love your way.
This is really cool and makes me happy!
Well planned parenthood pretty much always is. But Google worked for me. Most cities have at least one lgbt health clinic, even though they may be more focused on hiv/aids prevention and the gay male population. Just search lgbt + whatever you're looking for. Google allows businesses to add lgbt frieny flair to their landing page like for example when you do a search on maps.  also search transgender + what you're looking for. And check the doctors website. Most will list what services they offer and usually they will say like lgbt , hrt, etc. I personally don't go unless I see that on their website. But I'm sure calling would work too if you say something like,"" do you offer transgender/gender-affirming healthcare services at your office?"""	rpwasx	NonBinary	291	0.99	2021-12-27 20:18:40

I can’t imagine how shitty that must feel. The thing that most strikes me for non-cis-het-white-dudes is just how exhausting it must be. No-one should have to justify their existence.

I hope that you still manage to rest, treat yourself and have a nice day.
My sister said I wasn't allowed to come over until I apologized for coming out as NB. Phobes are selfish garbage.
So sorry you are going through that. Sending warmth and love. Hoping it gets better over time.
Holidays are nonsense and your family are buttholes :p
You have a loving community here. My mom recently told me some straight batshittery (""Though there have been nonbinary ET races that are the subject of human myth, humans are binary.""). So I decided that I'm just going to focus on my chosen family. They love and support me for being me.

If your family is choosing peace and order over showing you love and respect, they're making their priorities loud and clear, and you deserve to surround yourself with people who love and respect you.

There's plenty of us out there. You're not alone. ♥️♥️♥️
Being who you are never suck. Some members of your family, however, can suck a lot. I'm a teacher, openly pansexual and openly enby, so many students come to me seeking advice for how to deal with their families ""acceptance"".

I'll tell you what I usually tell 'em: Fuck acceptance. You don't need it from anyone other than yourself. What your relatives can decide is only wether they're gonna be part of your life or not. And if they choose the later, their loss. You'll eventually find your own weird, beautiful and loving family, even if they doesn't share the same blood as yours.
I'm sorry. Your identity shouldn't be political and that fucking sucks.
That sucks, if you were looking to be heard only, pls disregard what I typed below. I'm so sorry for going through something like that. Bigotry is a disease that's so hard to heal. Ugh. Sending you virtual socially distanced hugs if you consent, otherwise, virtual emotional warmth!

Is there a way to do a holiday celebration with people around you who don't celebrate xmas or don't have fam or holiday dinners to go to?

Or are there events that you can attend solo? I'm so sorry that your family is bigoted in this way. I find substituting plans, making interesting stories that end up in my memories helpful in feeling better.
If they don’t choose you then choose people that do. Family doesn’t have to be blood related. Family can be the ones you choose.
Felt that.. So sorry you have to deal witj this shit. Fuck phobes.
That sucks. My family doesn't think it is political. They also don't accept it yet do,  Pretty much they tell me I am A girl and make a big deal out of it. But they will also get mad at anyone whom isn't family whom misgenders me.
I feel for you that this is the reaction others have and are rejecting you for. That’s on them, not on you. It’s very shameful in them that they are the kind of person who can’t be mature enough, even if they disagree with someone, to put aside their differences and be together on a holiday and  share the love. 

You are enough and you are loved and you deserve your chosen family and will find one. You are worthy - I do hope you realize this in spite of their words and actions.

You are enough. You are good enough. They are not. Maybe it is better to move on to your own chapter and your own traditions than feel angst and suffering and pain and rejection. 

You are loved and you are enough! More than enough! Love to you now and always. May your day be full of peace and know that you are loved!
I wish I were a part of your family, I would invite you with open arms and heart.
I hate that anything that isn't cis het is deemed as political. Then just telling you that it'll stir something sucks. I also don't like that your family is willing to cut you from family activity because of it. Sorry your family is treating you like that.
Sorry. It'll get better
I’m sorry people have to be like this. Merry Christmas!
That’s awful, it’s despicable that your family is treating you like a political talking point, and basically shunning you. It’s not right, you don’t deserve any of that. I hope one day either your family comes around and treats you with respect, or you find a chosen family that treats you better. Sending love and positive energy from my family to you. ❤️ you deserve better
It indeed sucks being anything outside of the heteronormative, religious, or political mainstream (even among liberals, if you're more left leaning) when you're spending time with families.  I actually hate how my girlfriend's family can't leave us alone to actually relax, and they assume we want to build up a family to be just like theirs when we're both LGBTQ and child free.  It's ok to sit on the couch doing nothing for a whole hour, but the moment I pull out a book or try to make progress in a videogame they get on us for not participating.
Hugs :/
I wish you a merry holidays ❤️
Yep.  Alone today.  It's just easier for my family to pretend I never existed.

Like, they were abusive as hell, so I'm glad they're not in my life.  But even the half assed card they usually send is absent.

I never knew life could be like this, given that everyone I know has a family today.
Yes and also I have to say being guilted into going, treated like crap if you don't do, and still not going because you don't want to be attacked for existing is another aspect. >_> the holidays are such a load of shit anyways even for my cis het friends, so it's a minefield for people like us.
So pals I didn't open reddit the past 5 days and lemme tell you I'm BAWLING rn. Thank you so much for all the messages, the support and all your kind words. For all those who relates, I see you and I feel you. We gotta look after each other 🌟💜

Also, thank you for all the comments telling me being myself doesn't suck; others views on me do. I have a lot of internalized self transphobia in the sense of sometimes I just hate being trans for the social consequences and you made me realize that. I'm working on those internalized issues because I'm not gonna let myself down cause of it again.

I can't emphasize this enough, thank you all so much
I’m not a fan of politics in general. I’ve gotten into arguments with left and right. I know that isn’t a popular view but whenever political discussions start that are insulting or disrespectful, you can politely ask people to stop, or call them out on being children when they should be an adult about it.

Thank you, random citizen. I am now bawling on christmas eve, but I appreciate you 🎄💛
Your sister is just....jezus.  Really feeling the meaning of love and Christmas from her (sarcasm)
Apologised? She should apologise, that is stupid behaviour on her part. I hope you can fix this, she sounds horrible, she needs to sort that out
You re right. Sometimes even the links of blood are better left behind, at least during the time they need to adapt correctly by themselves if they want to
I cried a lot reading your message, thank you very much for your kind words. My partners, our friends and I are gonna have a late Yule next week 🥰
It sucks. Sometimes no matter how bad family treats us, we still want them to love us even a bit. I feel you, it's hard when they start to act like they forgot you exist.
We'll all have a chosen family one day with who we could spend some nice holidays, and in the meantime, just know you re not alone in this situation
Yeah, that's what happened last year, and probably participated in the fact I wasn't invited this Christmas too. 
I feel you, I just would like to spend the holidays eating good food and sharing stories without the constant fear too
Ofc I'm supposed to tell them they re childish when they ask me if I want fucking conversion therapy for Christmas 

I dont have to be polite or nice to people who wants me erased from the face of the earth just because of who I am
💚💚💚i hope happy tears, i love u, wherever you are my dear
She said she ""didn't believe in it"" and now I've ""made it awkward"" because she thinks I shouldn't be around her kids now. Was never a problem before.
Not if you don't want to no. I'm just someone who has gotten into fights where blood was drawn so I just wasn't trying to go that far with it or recommend anything illegal. I almost got the cops called on me before because of something sort of like that. 

I had an abusive sibling that said something nasty to me and I went way overboard with the beating. It escalted to us trying to maim each other or worse. I don't like fighting but tend to hold grudges and go in for the kill if I'm in one. Therapy has helped a bit.

I wasn't trying to say don't defend yourself, just try not to bash someone's head in like I tried to do once. You don't deserve the consequences for that.

They don't deserve your respect if they're going to treat you like that. I'm really sorry if that came across wrong.
She ""made it awkward"" and then blamed you for her own bigotry....what an asshole.
It breaks my heart because hasnt always been this way. Her husband practically brainwashed her into being his ideal tradwife."	zufblc	NonBinary	283	1.0	2022-12-24 18:13:30
Black and Non-binary Intersection	I am black and non-binary (amab) and throughout my life I have often found it difficult to navigate black spaces. For one, there are times when I am in “black male” spaces that there are hidden rules to leave my non-binary identity at the door. For my black non-binary folx, do you find that you fit into those spaces? Why or why not? Where have you felt accepted and truly like your non-binary identity is accepted and welcome?	"Very few places make me feel accepted tbh. At least around other black ppl I get to feel that sort of pride and belonging bc of shared experiences/struggle, but with queer spaces (unless their specifically BIPOC oriented) being nonbinary still leaves me feeling like an outsider if I don't present a certain way bc otherwise I'm misgendered constantly or shunned for not being a binary Trans person. And for whatever reason in the year of our lord 2023, ppl still feel threatened by my dark skin.
Black nonbinary here as well. It's a bit complicated, honestly. In some ways, I only really ""feel"" nonbinary because I don't fit into the white standard of gender, but I can exist in the black spectrum of gender and identity. So, it really depends on the group of black people. Some of them are really trying to conform to white society, are too heterosexual, conservative/religious or whatever and that is what it is. 

My biggest problem with Queer POC spaces has been how aggressively wrong they are in their politics lmao. Sooo many of them need to uninstall twitter and tiktok because it's making them immensely negative, insufferable and literally puritanical in their beliefs.

And somehow, lots of the LGBT spaces I find are racist and/or TERF-y? Like???? 

It's a fucking minefield out there. I still keep searching, though.
Black and nonbinary here. It’s really hard. There aren’t many spaces for us at all. It feels really isolating and I feel like I never hear about people like me. There’s a group on Facebook I’m in for Black people of marginalized genders w ADHD, but I feel like they forget that not everyone in that group is a woman. 

I really wish there was a space for us
the code switching has been one of the most negative parts about watching the global NB/Queer community grow over the last 10/15 years, because queer spaces will make you leave your Black at the door too. years & years of wanting/waiting for community only come to realize… oh shit these spaces are super racist (too.) Even this reddit skews a certain way that makes my eyes roll sometimes. 
But the most success in expressing myself I’ve found is being in QTPOC exclusive spaces. Dance floors, networking events, business meetings, gaming clubs, even clothes shopping, etc. Probably a win if it’s centering QTPOC just from all inherent inclusivity work. you’re right though - it’s a constant struggle
Idk, I’m just me. My skin is just pigment to me personally. I own my blackness as much as I own my left toenail, but again that’s just me. I understand for a lot of us QPOC, the OC is a badge of pride. I just never really cared that much in general.

 Wherever and with whomever the vibe is good, that’s where I am. My primary identity before anything else is skateboarder. My local park is decently queer friendly so that’s where I feel safest.
Not black but I walk a very similar road. Never do leave any of my identity’s behind I’d rather be isolated than do that
I truly believe we've been taught to think that we are rare. I adore my intersectionality and I refuse to believe it isolated me, even if I see this in practice. I'm mixed, so I'm also from an Arab and Muslim immigrant family on one side, so I've been told that I'm super rare. The more I see online the more I don't believe I'm alone. We are out here, we just have to work a little harder to find one another. As for irl, I don't have the privilege of being stealth so I've been actively told I'm crazy in spaces for folks of my ethnicity. I haven't really found trans accepting Black or Arab spaces. 
 This had me jumping to white queer spaces, but it was also not a good fit. 
I found white trans folks are white first, then trans. I lived in WI for school and it was like, white trans folks couldn't relate to my experiences but really thought they could. It was annoying. But at the end of the day, it gave me momentum to find more people like me. I even went on to create some spaces online for folks like me. I hope you have luck doing the same. ✌️
i’ve only felt accepted in queer and trans poc exclusive spaces. i have found in my experience white dominated trans spaces as well as black cishet spaces to be a source of dysphoria and really bad misgendering/gaslighting about my identity. for me at least, i only really advocate for myself in the most important spaces to me, to be visible as a nonbinary black person, ie my intimate and platonic relationships and in medical settings. those are of kind of my non-negotiables since i find myself not being honored in places like work or in-person gatherings/events
I feel the same way. Right now for me it is really hard because when I’m with a group of black cishet people I feel like I have to fit into the “woman” box even though I’m nonbinary trans fem. This is so frustrating for me and it’s been hard for me to not feel fake. It would be good if we could create black nonbinary spaces for ourselves because it’s getting really annoying. Colonization has done a number on our people because none of us black people fit into the gender binary that white colonizers created.
My two best friends who are also genderqueer and queer in general I feel completely myself and understood. But neither are black, one Korean-mexican and the others white. Otherwise I only feel that around other black genderqueer folk.
I have the same issues. I’m nonbinary/trans masculine. I don’t fit in the typical trans spaces. I have no desire to be a man, but I like the way the male body looks on me. Sometimes it gets very lonely out here… (afab)
Well, my take is if you keep looking for people who are exactly like you, you’re not gonna find many. I mean… black genderqueer people with ADHD is ridiculously specific. Thats literally a cognitive minority of a gender minority of a racial minority. Idk if you saw my comment, but I feel like because I’m not looking for anything specific, I find a lot of people I have in common with on a weekly basis and I’m not limited by those who are exactly like me☮️🤙
contrary to the point I made here, I can’t resist pointing out my own irony 😂 black genderqueer person with ADHD here, nice to meet ya😂
Black non-binary person with ADHD here. It seems that there are more of us out there than we think
Well, there are three of us now. We should start a group chat 😂

Finally feeling confident in my identity as a nonbinary person. Keeping the name I picked when I thought I was FtM, but with the more neutral nickname of Emmy as an alternative to the full name		"You look amazing!!

after spending a lottt of time exploring my gender identity, I finally decided to shave my head. I feel so amazing and so free right now		"Special thanks to this community for being so accepting and helping me feel valid in who I am
YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE!! big congrats! also shaved head gang 🤝
It’s so awesome. You rock it so well!
Omg, you look fantastic!! 🥰 I love it!!
It's look so good on you!
In love with this and in love with your piercing jewelry ✨
You look so great!
It looks so good on u, I'm thinking about shaving my head would you recommend it?
One of us one of us
Yes! It feels freeing. It’s a reminder that hair is only hair. It will grow back. It’s easier to wash, and no brushing or styling when you wake up. There’s also the freedom of being able to present more masculine, feminine, or androgynous whenever you want
I put some earrings on and some lipstick this morning and I feel like a badass. Tomorrow I’m gonna steal my boyfriends clothes and try a button up look hehe
Thanks for the detailed response, the advice is really helpful :)"	obbvfo	NonBinary	268	1.0	2021-07-01 02:05:30
Had an experience at the barber shop. It was awful, but then it wasn't.	"My context: I identify as agender/nonbinary and usually present neutrally. People tend to read me as female unless I make an effort to present in a very masculine way. I live in an area with a decent queer population but not a ton of trans awareness, so most people tend to read me as a butch lesbian without thinking gender identity might be relevant to my presentation. I'm usually ok with that, since I also identify with dyke culture to some degree and I'm the sort of agender person who finds it seriously ironic that not identifying with the concept of gender means I end up explaining gender to people all the time, so I don't mind just not having the conversation. But... you will understand that this is a compromise that can lead to uncomfortable situations.

I get my hair cut at a little local barbershop. Good barber shops are among my favorite things. This is a traditional shop in many ways: no hipster stuff, no brews on tap, no fancy styling, just a trained barber who gives me a solid $10 haircut that looks exactly like I want it to every time. But it's also not the kind of shop that has Playboy mags in the waiting area. I have always experienced it as a friendly space with good banter.

So, I'm in there a couple days ago for my usual shearing, and there is a group of several guys ahead of me all getting cuts, with two guys left in line. They're just having typical bro conversation and leaving me alone while I do introvert things on my phone and wait... until the last guy in line sits down for his cut. This guy starts going off about how much he hates... well, just about everything I value, actually. There are plenty of Trumpsters on the fringes of this city, so I'm used to hearing/ignoring a lot of this. But when he starts in on trans issues, saying things like ""there's just no moral decency left in the world any more"" and ""if you're a human, you can't just up and be an airplane"" and ""they're gonna try to get rid of real men and women and take over"" and ""it's Sodom and Gomorrah out there,"" I feel the blood starting to drain from my face, my heart rate rising, that floating feeling coming on... all that fun triggery stuff. 

He's leaving no room for anyone else to speak, and I wish I could jump in, but I don't feel safe--I'm surrounded by this dude's bro friends in a small shop without a whole lot of other people nearby. I assume this is not directed at me; he has probably read me as female, as most people do; he also hasn't said anything about gay issues, which would be less socially acceptable to rant about in this city, so I think he's just an oblivious asshole rather than a deliberate troll. I know that if I say anything, I'll out myself. I physically can't make myself speak. I feel myself trying to make my body small. I'm staring at the same text message on my phone unable to read the words, angry with him for thinking it's ok to blast like this and angry with myself for being unable to do anything but keep breathing. I finally get to the point where I think I should just leave. But I need a haircut, and I've waited a while, and I don't want to let this guy chase me out of my usual barber shop.

Finally, he pauses his rant long enough to ask the barber, ""Do you know what I mean, man?"" And the barber says, ""No, I really don't know what you mean. I don't agree with anything you just said. You are entitled to your own opinion, but I think your opinion is wrong. Hey, I'm done--do you want to look at the back?""

And the guy just stops talking, pays, and leaves with his whole group. 

I then get the reliable haircut I came for. There isn't as much bantering with the barber as there usually would be, since I'm still coming down from what just happened. Again, I feel I want to say something, but I can't. I have all these conflicting feelings. I would have liked for him to step in and stop the guy from going off like that before it happened, but that's not his job any more than it is mine. He has no clue I am trans any more than the random guy, so he probably thought those words weren't hurting anyone who was actually present. But they were, and I do wish he would have taken that extra step to make his shop feel safe for everyone. 

But on the other hand, the second he replied the way he did, I felt so incredibly relieved, like the weight just lifted. I don't care what a random asshole thinks. I do care that my barber doesn't agree with him, and I give him credit for saying so, and it did shut the guy up when he did--just a little late. I'm grateful to him and a little resentful towards him all at once, which of course makes me feel greedy for wanting just a little more than I got. He could have said nothing at all, and I would still be triggered, and I might have just walked out. But instead I feel safe again and I got my hair cut.

When it's time to pay, I tip well (as always), and I say, ""This is for today's haircut. The next time I come in, that will be for what you said to that guy."" He shakes my hand and smiles, and while you can never really know from a simple gesture like that, it feels to me like he understands more than just what I said. And I go about my day.

I don't think anyone in this situation did exactly the right thing, but I also think it's rarely possible to do exactly the right thing. All I know is that I got triggered, bigtime, but I walked out of that place with the same great no-drama masculine haircut I like, and I felt good again. Maybe even a little better than I had before, because I already knew there were transphobic assholes all over, but I didn't know that my barber isn't one of them. Now I do, and I can keep coming back to this shop even though I had a nasty experience there today. That feels like a small victory, even if it's not a pure and glorious one.

I'm not feeling like I need support over this; I'm just sharing an experience others might be able to identify with, and would welcome any ideas about how others handle situations like this."	"Oh, Lord...I live in cow country, REPUBLICAN RED NECK USA....I feel for you.

Especially if this is your first time having to hear someone spout this crap in public, as if it were normal.

I had culture shock *big time* when I moved here.

In my neck of the woods, the barber would have either just nodded and smiled, or actually agreed with the asshole.

I'm glad yours didn't!
I know it was incredibly uncomfortable for you, but I actually like the way the barber handled it - he let the guy go all the way out on his hateful gangplank, gave him all the rope he wanted, and then let him dangle the moment he sought affirmation for his hate. What a deeply unsatisfying moment that must have been for him! He spent all that time speechifying, rolling out his entire spiel, breathlessly exuding the whole nasty fart of his personal belief system on everyone in the room, then tries to throw up his arms at the finish line ... and gets completely shut down in front of absolutely everyone. Devastation! And he didn't get to enjoy starting an argument or making anyone engage with the many points of his foolishness. Nope. Just a whole bag of hot air, smacked flat right in his face.

Because of my own presentation throughout life, I've had far too many interactions with those jackasses and their stupid entitlement in any particular moment. Seeing them get shut down like this has become a treasured delight, especially because it's so rare. The only other thing I find more satisfying is the more complicated and time-consuming Socratic Method applied diligently, patiently, and unrelentingly to their BS. I'm generally too internally worked up to be the one to deliver these moments for myself, so my appreciation for others is already high, but even moreso when it's someone they thought of as a potential supporter of their inanity.

Again, I'm sorry that you were uncomfortable in that lengthily painful moment, rightfully but regrettably so, not knowing how this was going to play out. Regardless of how slapped down he felt at the end, the fact that you were made to suffer through that isn't right. All in all, I'm glad you found that a modicum of trust you'd extended had proven to be worthwhile, while regretful at how it was proven.
What a great story. Thank you for sharing!
Ok this made me happy cry a bit.  I'm so glad that your barber stood up to him even if it may not have been for your sake.  It shouldn't have to be because you or any other LGBT+ person is there.  I live in a somewhat liberal town surrounded by conservatives in all the surrounding areas and I have to be careful about how I present myself when I go certain places.  I hope things are changing for the better for all of us. 🤗
I am a straight male and have absolutely no way of sympathizing with the experience you had. I find trans culture both alluring and fascinating. You touched on it when writing it out but my feeling is that you should really analyze the feeling of the barber not saying/doing enough. He is a person too and you said it yourself he isn't obligated to be the guy who tells the jerk in the chair what for, I would have but that isn't how it always works. I'm touched by this story and I want you to know there are people out here who love and appreciate you FOR YOU. It isn't always about how you wish people would act towards you and be accepting towards you its in my opinion more about cherishing the people who normalize trans issues. Who will say the things that barber said without a second thought. You are an extension of all of us and we MUST treat trans people just as they are; our sisters and our brothers. 

Love you, thanks for sharing your story. Best wishes :)
I think the end of your story touches on what a cis Irish drag queen who campaigned for marriage equality said.

Prior to the referendum, if someone made an off colour remark, he felt alone as a gay man, say, at the bus stop. He felt like the asshole, that nobody likes.

Now that the country has voted for eqiality, if someone says something, he knows that the rest of the country accepts him and disagrees. Bigots will still be bigots, but they can only be openly bigoted if everyone else goes along with it. When they are called out, they keep it to themselves next time.

What your Barber did didn't help you in this situation. It did help to stop the bigot next time, so props to him. Baby steps get us all the way, just slowly.
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Thank you for sharing your story. Also, you’re a really strong writer. Do you write professionally? (Cheers to no-drama, masculine haircuts. I love my velvety buzzcut.)
Thanks. It's not the first time, as I grew up in redneck cow country, but it's the first time since trans issues hit the mainstream as a topic of conversation, and the first time since my trans egg cracked. I have lived in the warm, safe bubble of probably the queer/trans-friendliest area in the world for the past several years, and the move to my current city has been worth it but still hard. 

I have heard everything he said before--in fact, it was all so familiar that I'm pretty sure he got his talking points from the Internet--but not out loud, in public, in person, and in my face, at least not since I have understood that those words were about me. It felt so different from seeing those same things online, when I am safely far away from the person who wrote them and can easily retreat to a safer community like this one.

Side note: I'm usually afraid to post to Reddit, as I have had the usual ""Experiences(TM)"" with that in the past. This is actually my first day on r/nonbinary. I just didn't know it existed before now. I'm glad I found you all here!
Thank you so much for every sentence of this reply.

I like what the barber did too, even more after having talked about the situation with some other locals who have lived here longer than I have. It's worth noting also that this guy's friends were clearly not on the same page, but were saying nothing. I would be willing to bet that what the barber said led to a conversation after they left, and at least one of those guys might have felt empowered to disagree when he might not have without that little seed of ""nope"" being planted. That's powerful stuff.

I too long for the Socratic Method takedown. That's what I aim for when I meet people in safe environments whom I believe can be reasoned with. This simply did not feel like one of those instances, but of course I fantasize that if I were a perfect person, I could have created the opportunity for that. 

The situation as it played out did remind me of how important it is to emphasize to my straight/cis friends who are allies that their voices matter too--and we need them so much, because we can't always be the standard bearers for things that matter to us, and because some people simply won't listen to us because of who we are, but might listen to them. A couple of this guy's friends were giving him disapproving looks the whole time he was ranting; if just one of them had given him a little verbal pushback, I think it might have shut him down. He wasn't exactly showing any evidence that he had thought through his opinions; people like that tend to respond to peer pressure, in my experience.

Your point about your own presentation leading to these experiences made me think. I just started testosterone, and I think this experience hit me harder because I realized that I am about to surrender the privilege of being invisible in situations like this one. I'm not interested in passing as male, so starting a few months from now, I will probably register as ""other"" to this guy and people like him for the rest of my life. That's where I feel most comfortable within myself, but I won't deny that it hurts to give up the small bit of privilege I have enjoyed by passing as female when that has been convenient for the past 30 years. I won't lie: I am a little afraid of how the world will react to this change. But I am so certain that it is right for me that I don't really care. Bring on the next challenge and I'll do my best with it as exactly who I am.
Also, it's nice to think about how he likely didn't get the nice haircut - he got an angry haircut.
I think things are changing for the better, all in all, in the long-term sense. People are self-segregating ideologically in ways that make me worry, but I still truly believe that the march of history is with us. It sounds like we are in similar places right now; I wish you luck and strength. I know I need it!
I appreciate the way you chose your words, for starters, and want to add my two cents. 

We can agree that the barber handled the situation still. I think it's also fine to feel like you want more out of an interaction without necessarily placing blame on anyone for not bringing that. When we feel threatened I think it's only reasonable to wish people could stand up for us. I'm very familiar with the simultaneous gratitude and feeling it's nor enough in this situation that the op describes. I don't consider it a reflection on anyone else so much as an observation that their good reaction doesn't fully solve the problem. It's a recognition that someone else has a lot more power in that situation that they chose not to use, for any number of good reasons we aren't privy to, but not a judgment necessarily. 
Thank you for your reply. I appreciate it! I responded to neurophilos' reply to your comment in a way that was mostly intended for you, if you are interested.
I agree! And that's a great anecdote/reference to keep on file. Thank you.
Actually, I have never heard of /r/nonbinary...I have no idea how your post made it to my front page. 

But I'm glad it did, if I was in any way able to help.
Thank you for replying in a helpful way before I came back to this comment.

For the person you replied to: I do appreciate your thoughts, truly. It's worth stating that I recently moved to this area from a place where the kind of ranting this guy was doing would have been shut down immediately by SOMEONE in the room. It was a bubble, and the experiences I enjoyed there that played out like that were not the kind of thing that trans people experience in 99% of the world. We got to enjoy a certain kind of privilege and safety that trans people almost never get, and it's unreasonable to expect that of the rest of the world as it is. I know this. But it was also a beautiful thing to feel normal and supported there, and it's very hard to adjust to a more typical environment, with less awareness of trans issues, and less of a default consensus that trans people should be accepted and it's not cool to go off the way he did.

I do think the way the barber responded was a big deal, and I am happy it went down that way. He could have taken the easy route and simply given a noncommittal ""yeah"" when asked ""do you know what I mean?"" That implicit confirmation means something, although people give it all the time when they don't really agree without realizing that failing to challenge bigotry only emboldens it. That's what I expected him to say, just to avoid confrontation, and I wouldn't have blamed him. That's why what he actually said gave me such relief. But... I have lived in a place where this guy's rant never would have gotten to that point at all, and that was undeniably better and safer for me as a trans person. So there is an adjustment that comes with moving to a less accepting environment, and the disappointment I felt was part of that, as was the guilt for feeling that disappointment at all. 

I am willing to take the discomfort and the occasional triggers that result from living here in exchange for the other reasons I have for being here, and I feel that in a way my presence here is more important than it was in the more accepting place I lived before, if only because I can be the person to shake the barber's hand and tell him that what he said mattered, and if I had not been there, maybe nobody would have been able to give that feedback. 
No, I totally understand where you are coming from. I agree whole-heartedly that your presence in that environment is absolutely a benefit to those who don't have the same ideologies as unempathetic meatheads. What is so interesting to me is the unwavering abhorrence to anything different from what we the 40's and 50's taught us. A bullshit; unrealistic ideal of what community, family, love, and happiness is. I wish the best for you just as easily as I would wish the best for a family member. Hate is a lack of empathy and humanism. I identify as straight, and I lean that way 85% of the time but I'll be damned if I don't see a trans person and say ""fuck yeah, they have got it going on."" That's what makes humans so funny, we cling on to conformity so much that we often times rob ourselves of new experiences, some that very well could be more meaningful than the ones we planned. 

As always, with love

I'm still not sure about my identity etc. But I know I feel more comfortable in this community than in Binary trans or Cis spaces		"For clarity, I'm Amab (ofc) but I've been on HRT for ~3 years to deal with some gender dysphoria. I tend to identify as a cis man but I empathise a lot with then NB community given my not exactly standard relationship with gender
love your look!!🙌✨ also, try not to put too much pressure on yourself to identify, either. I don't fit much of anywhere but I find that NOT being labeled is so much more cathartic (in my personal exp.) than being labeled. But regardless, I wish you the best on your self-discovery journey!!🌹
You be you beautiful. XXX Love your hair!
Feel comfortable where you’d like choice is always a liberating thing
We support you 💜
We welcome you! I’m glad you found a space where you’re comfortable!
You are absolutely gorgeous, no matter what label you decide on. Pics like this give me hope that I can look like how I want to.
Hah I guess you're right. I'm in a weird spot where I feel like I need a label that'll adequately explain to people who I am but on the other hand I'm kind of a gender abolitionist and I'd just love it if we lived in a world where those labels are gone
Lol I'm trying to get it under control with CG. Trying to reduce all that frizz :P

"Do you get offended or triggered when cis people ask you ""what's your bio sex""?"	"I don't know but personally I don't like getting asked that question from strangers because I feel like they will start misgender me or they invalidate my gender identity. 

Thoughts?"	"I don't get offended, but I definitely make it clear that it's none of their business
""You're neither my doctor nor my type, so you'll never know""
""Why are you asking me about my genitals? What are you, some kind of pervert??""
Other than like a medical or legal situation, I get pissy because I can't think of a single reason to ask other than someone being inappropriately nosy. What does knowing my agab have to do with anything? It doesn't tell you what people refer to me by, how I act, how I feel, how I move through the world today. I really feel like if someone is insistent that I tell them my agab they just want to misgender me on some level.
Totally inappropriate for an adult to ask unless they’re giving you medical care but if a child asks me I feel flattered 😌
Typically they don't but in all honesty, since I realized *the cis absolutely do this to each other 100% of the time anyway*, I know it has nothing to do with me or any trans person actually being trans. These are people who take for granted that someone's genitals can be guessed by their presentation, and they only react poorly when what they've assumed has been countered, or they can't make an assumption. They get so weird about us specifically BECAUSE **they feel completely, wholly entitled to know what any given individual's genitals are in the first place.** They are just as perverse about each other and other cis people, literally every single child born, and binary trans people. So I don't take it personally anymore, LOL. However, since I physically resemble one binary gender, it's not  a problem I often get to encounter, since they just presume they already know. But the same entitlement complex is at the root of both behaviors.
It's never happened to me. I think my general plan is to respond by asking if we're going to be having sex.
I find it annoying bc it's none of their business. 99% of the time they're just being nosy and invasive at best, fetishizing and dangerous at worst. My body type makes it very clear that I'm AFAB but on the very rare occasion I make sure they end up uncomfortable. ""Why are you asking what my genitals look like? That makes you sound like a predator. Do I need to call security? Why do you think that's any of your business? You're not my type, so piss off and learn some manners."" Any variation of those.
No one has asked me, but if they did, I would definitely be offended. I would probably say something like, 'Oh, you want to know what's in my pants? Let's talk about what's in your pants first"" or ""It seems really weird how interested you are in my genitals.""

My dad's wife recently asked my sister if my spouse had ""fully transitioned"" and my sister said, ""I don't know what \[spouse's\] genitals look like because IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.""
I get a bit grouchy, because that's unimportant information to anyone who isn't a doctor. People ask that if they plan to misgender.
Depends how they ask. If they just said that as quoted probably annoyed. But if they're genuinely just trying to learn and improve their understanding of the experience and shit like that then I don't mind talking about anything. Its pretty easy to tell the difference for me since it's still pretty obvious lol
Yes. That and questions about how I've medically transitioned.
It's just another gross way of asking about your genitals. I like to uno reverse that uncomfortable feeling onto them by asking ""Wow , do you ask everyone about their genitals?"" . 

The exception is if this is pertinent to health care related needs.
If someone's not trying to get IN MY PANTS they don't need to know what's there.
Unless they are my medical provider, someone asking fot legal reasons, or someone who is interested in a sexual situation then it isn't their business. I find it annoying and triggering
Besides my doctor and someone I’m actively having sex with, there is no reason for anyone to inquire about my birth sex. “Offended” isn’t the right word, but annoyed and exhausted maybe.
yes
idk ask them an inappropriate question about their genitals back like “cut or uncut?” or “hot dog bun or taco?”
> ‘are you afab or amab’ why? you tryna figure out what typa holes i got? you tryna bang??

""sorry love im taken"" used to be my reaponse
Personally, it would depend more on who and why, but nobody has ever asked me and I feel that I would actually be happy if they did as it would mean that they can't tell themselves.
""Yeah, but are you a boy or a girl? Like, originally?""

""Wouldn't you like to know, weatherboy?""
Why are they asking about private medical information? Is this show and tell? Do they have diabetes? What birth defects do they have? We're they born with a tail? Come on, tell me the gorey details if we're sharing. /s 🙄
whenever someone asks me what i was assigned at birth i save myself the headache and automatically assume they’re asking “so what are you *actually*?”
Yeah it's... Eh.

It feels like they do that so they can mentally know """"what I actually am"""" and praise themselves for the effort of still gendering me correctly despite that
Yes. It's invasive and creepy.
I don’t get triggered but it is a really creepy thing for people to ask, and I guarantee if I was cis they wouldn’t be asking pervy questions. You don’t need to know what’s in my pants. Period.
As an intersex person I love completely pwning people who ask that question
No because they think i am my bio sex no matter how many nonbinary badges flags and bracelets i have
Considering ""bio gender"" isn't a thing I get real annoyed. It's rude af and incredibly misinformed.
not sure of the right words but I usually troll them a bit
when they do this or even if they start asking what my ""real"" name is 

 I'm AFAB trans masc
but agender auDHD in the like alien way 

 anyway when they hear I'm trans tend to assume I'm a ""pre"" trans femme 

it's probably not great to ask them ""what do you think it is"" but I usually couple it with ""how old do you think I am"" 

cause I also get clocked for like 10 years younger 

and just train wrecking their expectations

but I'll also counter any snowflake bs with well I did join the military (not that means jack and or shit and I'll say queer people especially gender queer == braver than any US marine )

but it has happened where they start using she her etc when they find out or I've told that I'm trans masc 
I then usually will call them by a name that is on the side of the binary they are not but won't misgender
if you plan on having sex with me, then you get to ask.  i think that's part of consent, making sure that nobody has any expectations that might cause confusion or embarrassment.  and a hetero or homo preference is totally valid.  some people just aren't into what you're packing.

but outside of that or your doctor trying to figure out if there could be any potential side effects of a drug?  fuck off outta there.
Not so much offended as creeped out at people’s audacity to ask what sex parts you have. Especially because I used to get asked this a lot more in high school.. and it was mostly fully grown adults asking
Yup, 100%
It makes me wanna go haywire fr, like what is that info to them? 
Besides medical stuff only the doctors have to know, it's really not important in day to day life smh
The vast majority of cis people who do that later on use it to try an invalidate me so that's also maybe why I just get mad at this point
I hate it so much
I haven’t gotten this yet (I still very much present my agab 😒), but I could see myself being really really annoyed by it outside of a medical context.
i’ve reached a point that when i mention i’m trans people ask me “oh so which way are you transitioning?” which peak andro euphoria tbh, but frankly i live in a hard red state where a lot of people have never even talked to gay people let alone a trans person so although i get some…rude questions it’s never been intentionally so they’re trying their best to understand and that’s so much more than i expect where i live. the best thing is to redirect their questions and let them know they shouldn’t word it/ask/ whatever it may be in the way they did bc it’s offensive. i’m fine with explaining things in detail if it means the other person gains knowledge of trans stuff and a positive first experience with a trans person
If someone asks, I make it a point to tell people it's not their business. Aside from a medical professional who may need to know it for treatment options, it's nobody's business what's in my pants.
I look way too femme for people to ask sadly. I'd be thrilled and annoyed at the same time, like wow, you had to ask?? :O But also bugger off, I'm not gonna tell you
Triggered? No. Offended? That's complicated. Most people that are engaging for this line of questions are being disingenuous. Intentionally being cruel for the sake of cruelty. If we get to that point in the conversation it means I fucked up and let my guard down and wasn't paying attention to cut them off long before we got there.
Yes.
Never happened to me. I might actually feel some accomplishment if I got that inquiry to be honest..

However thinking about it on principal it’s obviously wrong and isn’t a normal or polite question to ask someone!
The only time I get offended is when being asked during surveys. You know, those things that \*should\* be anonymous for. Overall, unless my doctor, it is no one's business but my own.
It’s absolutely unnecessary unless it’s a medical provider. I definitely feel like they will disregard my chosen gender to label me by my sex if they ask this.
I don't get offended but I gess it could come of this way because usually when I got asked this it was in arguments with my old friends to try upset me or make me uncomfortable because they knew me before I knew I was enby and still look like AGAB
I wouldn’t go as far to say I get attended but it weird me out cause they have no business knowing. It’s not important.
I never had it happened but I can imagine I’d say “why?”. People either think I’m a guy or gal which makes me usually stare at them and not respond
Idk if offended is the right word but it definitely would make me super uncomfortable
To be asked that would imply there's a question, so I'm not gonna lie I think itd feel kinda euphoric.  Still none of their business tho, wouldn't let them know that 😂
I've never been asked this by an adult thanks to the place I live being pretty accepting, but I used to get asked by kids a lot bc I've always been androgynous. It definitely feels icky, but even though it sucks you can't really blame kids because sometimes they don't know any better, they're just curious. The best case with that is just to be honest, explain, and try to let it not get to you.
there’s just no reason for anyone to ever need to know that about me unless they’re my doctor or working with my doctor. and this hasn’t happened to me (that i remember tbf) but i wouldn’t say i’d be offended or triggered. i’d just be a pretty weirded out
Literally wildly bizarre that strangers would ever come up to you and ask you what genitals you have. If someone asks you politely if they can ask, and then asks due to potentially questioning their own gender/being LGBTQ, in a setting where that's been established as acceptable, that's... almost permissible, but even then, they're on thin ice.
In just about every context except one, yea, I'd probably be offended, at the very least really uncomfortable. The only time it wouldn't be is if we were having a genuine conversation about gender vs sex or something like that.
I assume it's either 1. 'but what are you really?' or 2. ignorant curiosity. Either way, none of their gd business. It really annoys me.
I don’t really know how I feel. It doesn’t really happen to me, cus it’s visually fairly obvious. Unless I’m in a full beat, and even then, I feel like there’s no hiding the AMAB origins.

I guess it happened once on Grindr. A guy asked “What ARE you?” And that sucked. But I always figured that was because of his shit delivery and subsequent transphobia.
Not offended! Not at all! It’s human behavior to be curious. Too bad this often isn’t a place of curiosity, but more so a way to mock or belittle. Have you explain yourself to them so they feel like the bigger person. Personally, I’m non-binary because I feel gender is a concept that should simply be abolished! It’s outdated and hardly does anyone any favors! So asking me what I was before realizing I was ENBY is simply pointless :] it’s like asking a person what they were before they were born, like all you are is a mere concept before then
Unless they're a medical person, they don't need to know. I'm not dating anyone, so a potential partner doesn't need to know. I get grossed out honestly.
No one’s ever asked me directly about mine, but someone did ask about my ex’. It caught me off guard & made my feel uneasy, but I didn’t get “offended” (you have every right to tho). I just told her “it doesn’t matter”. Im not 100% sure she kept pushing but it’s possible, in which case I just repeat what I said in a sterner voice. 

So personally I don’t really get offended/triggered at first, but if the person doesn’t respect my answer I’ll definitely start getting upset. I’ll also tend to get more hesitant around the person cause I don’t feel comfortable with ppl who could possibly be transphobic.
I personally don't get offended or triggered. I would rather get confused and/or a bit disappointed. like- why does it matter? why do you care? what difference will it make in how you look at me? or anything like that. It's just a weird and stupid question.
No not really I just say “ I’m your mum”
Depends on the circumstances 
If it's not meant in an offensive or disrespectful way then I'm fine with it
If the person isn't a sex partner or medical professional currently treating you they actually have no right to know the current or former state of your genitals.

Sex partner is negotiable. If it's me, surprise me.
Yes because frankly it’s none of their business in the first place and secondly it feels very invasive. Cisgender people ask that question like they automatically have the right to know what sex we were assigned to at birth. 

It’s similar to asking what our deadnames are. I don’t get that question a lot because my chosen name is gender-neutral, and everyone thinks that it is my birth name. But trust me, gender-neutral or not, I would not stick with my birth name regardless.

They almost feel entitled to knowing it, when that is something shouldn’t have to share with anyone.
I personally don’t care about gender like… at all. I prefer they/them pronouns and I see myself as agender but I’m fine with people seeing me as whatever so asking me that question is valid for me I guess
I'm not out/confusing-looking yet, but I don't think.I'll care much.

Maybe enough to be coy about it.

But ask again in a couple years...🤷
Neither, tbh. I very much look like a woman and don't mind being called one. I love women. I'm just not one.
I don't get offended/triggered but I always ask them why they want to know what genitals a minor has. If they keep asking I then start to call them a pervert and gross for wanting to know a minors genitals. lol.
What does this mean?
I mean it's very context dependent. Most of the time something like this happens to me it's either out of ignorance because they genuinely don't think a question like that could be seen as rude, or it's because they are interested in hooking up with me and want to know what genitals I have.

The former I will usually answer with something cheeky like ""why do you want to know what genitals I have"" which I feel like is a subtle way of making a point of how weird of a question it is. The latter I will just straight up say what genitals I have to get to the point.

I could see a scenario where someone is asking this in a derogatory way ""I don't believe you're non-binary so what gender are you really"", in which case yes that would definitely offend me and I wouldn't even bother to answer.
Idc
I mean to me if they are my doctor it's fine. It's more so that cis people have this weird thing where they need to know what your genitalia is, to see how to act around you as if they could become more with you. It's annoying when they base you based if they are sexually interested in you based on their own sexuality.
Completely depends, when we're talking about theater where I need to choose characters that look like me or someone like a doctor where they need to know what problems I can and can't have, I don't mind, but if it's someone who doesn't need to know, I do
Not personally. Although I’m non-binary I’m still connected to being AFAB and identify as such.
I haven't had this happen to me yet as I can't dress androgynous, but if I did I'd say ""Sorry I don't think I heard you quite right, are you asking me to describe my genitals?"".
My partner’s mom keeps asking what my chromosomes are and I’m like, “I don’t know, do you know yours?? You been tested??”
No, sometimes it gives me the opposite effect. I love to say, ""Wouldn't you like to know? :) ""
I’m actually fine with it, but with how I present I usually don’t have to since I’m a Demi-boy. It depends on how they ask and the context obviously. But generally no one really asks
Before non binary was a widely recognized thing.  I would get asked this all the time.  But people would more so say, I’m sorry, I dont mean to be rude. But are you a boy or a girl? It was uncomfortable then and it’s uncomfortable now, haha
I just get uncomfortably flirtatious with them
Kinda sad I don’t get asked that, because I look so much like what people expect with my AGAB, but, if it did happen, then I’d probably just correct the question, “You mean my *assigned gender at birth*.“

I also tend to not be offended, because I expect it to happen and because I don’t want to let others affect me like that, in any subject. Just seems healthier to ignore people when I can. The only time I was offended when it came to my gender, I was very sick, so I think that had to do with that; I don’t even remember exactly what was said, but had something to do with being a mother/parent.
No, but no one asks, they just assume...
“I’m sorry, I just feel weird disclosing my medical history to people I’m not close with.”
Never really happens at all.  I just get mad that people keep assuming I identify as a man
Yeah, that starts the ""worry train"" for me too... But it rarely happens, cuz I'm not appearing the way I want...
It's a gross question no matter who gets offended by it.  Unless there's attraction between you two and you're about to start talking about sex, they don't need to know at all
Cis people not be obsessed with trans people's genitals challenge.

Why would you ask anybody that?! It's just gross.
I don't really care what anyone calls me or what they think.

But I understand if those things bother you, and if they do bother you, I'd support you in asking them to be respectful.
Yes
ahh ppl dont ask me that bc im an afab femme presenting which kinda sucks cuz ppl instantly assume im a cis woman. it would be fun to confuse them:(
Not really, but I always reject to answer, telling them it doesn’t matter.
Offended or triggered is the wrong word, I get pissed off that a stranger thinks they are entitled to knowing what's in my pants. Generally, I don't share that with strangers, nor do they share it with me, and I believe that's a boundary that most people want to maintain (unless in specific settings and circumstances, eg. cruising, sexpositive parties or hookups) and indeed have a fundamental human right to uphold.
Strangers, yes. and creeped out. Like are they trying to imagine my anatomical structure or body parts? 

My friends, not really. They usually know because I can't bind constantly and I openly talk about periods and other ""girl"" topics. *still plan to once i transition cus just cus I plan to get rid of those processes doesn't mean i wont try to be helpful if others have it, and to reduce the taboo.* 

In high school ppl would just ask for my ""real name"" and either from awareness, the town I am in, or other things but most people don't as for my deadname. I do make jokes about it, and am open to telling people as long as I know them and they know me long enough to never think of using my deadname.
Not offended as such - just hit 'em with the ""none of your business 😎👉👉""
It used to happen to me so much growing up (years before I was an adult or out of the pantry) that my knee jerk response is to ask ""Are you my doctor??"" When they look confused or try to double down I can usually change the subject or walk away at that point.

Some folks are the worst. Triggered? Yeah, still fuckin yeah.
I get irritated. Not full-blown offended or triggered. I just think it’s a pointless invasive question.
ummm... not offended but uncomfortabke
Oooh imma have to start using this lmao
I do the same thing! Especially cause I'm a minor and its normally adults asking me that.
This. Little kids just want to learn and know things.
🤯 thanks so much for articulating this!
I hadn't thought of it that way before, thank you
And if they are it's a different kind of conversation.
Hot dog bun or taco 💀
Same
this is also my attitude 😂 otherwise i'd get too angry about the fact that someone thought it was totally fine & appropriate to ask another person what's in their pants! bc, really, that's what it boils down to.
Bro wtf with those surveys? They were was a survey asking for my gender when I succeed passing in my university and the only options were ""man/woman"" 💀.

Like first of why you need to know that???
Second of wtf I'm neither!!!!
exactly!
Ew. What in all hell
I'm afab and sometimes watch my friends kiddos. The youngest insists on using he/him pronouns with me and when we make video game avatars she always designs me as a boy. Not only do I find it really affirming in a sense, but it's just so fuckin cute dude.
When I realized, it was definitely a ""...well *fuck me*"" moment, and it has absolutely been weirdly validating since then. 

To me personally, it's at least a little reassuring that the cis are this kind of gross about literally everyone, and it just flies under the radar until they're confronted with a person they can't guess. They simply feel entitled to information about the genitals of any human they see in the first place. And they're, like, weirdly proud to participate in that entitlement, too? I've come across no small handful of bigots who are like ""OF COURSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW I HAVE A PENIS JUST BY LOOKING AT ME, NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN BEING ABLE TO TELL, I'D SHOW YOU WHAT'S IN MY PANTS IN AN INSTANT TO PROVE IT!"" 

So as fucking bizarre and reductive as it is, it's oddly comforting that it's at least a form of scrutiny they subject *everyone* to, including themselves.
Yeah its gross and weird but happens quite often to me at least. lol"	12ktm0r	NonBinary	263	0.97	2023-04-13 15:51:37

Thank you so much lovely xx 🥰🥰 good to be back
Too kind lovely thank you! I am absolutely in a way better mindset than I was late last year 🥰🥰 hope this year has been good for you as well ❤❤
I'm happy to hear that. Life can be a little unkind sometimes, throwing too much at us at once. Glad to hear that you faced your challenges head on and came out on top. I can't know what difficulties you face from my experience. But if you ever need to talk about anything I'm willing to listen. Hope you stay strong.
Too sweet my lovely! X it was mostly gender identity stuff and finding out where I am in the community but I think I found my nook and I'm happy with where I am 🥰
That's wonderful. Inner reflection is hard sometimes but uplifting. Knowing who you are and feeling comfortable with it is important. Glad you were able to get to that point"	pvpp1w	NonBinary	267	1.0	2021-09-26 08:17:16

So tired of the ignorance (transphobia warning)	"Transphobia has been inescapable lately, it feels like no place is safe. I already got horrid vibes from my job, but my coworkers having a very uneducated discussion really proved it. I’m not out to anyone, that’s why they decided to run their fucking mouths. And even if I was it hurts knowing they would have silently and constantly disrespected me. 

I’m so tired of Trans people having to constantly prove who and what they are, when other cis people don’t even meet up to their obscure and superficial standards. What’s even more ironic is them questions why all this “gender and identity stuff has to be in school it that’s not what it’s about” hm, I don’t know, maybe it’s because dipshits like you can’t even be bothered to look more into to people “you don’t understand” in the era of the fucking internet. It hurt when my coworker said “they/them is stupid as fuck” glad to know you would have and never will respect me. 

Im terrified of our future and I hate confirming that yeah, im not Fucking safe anywhere. And im terrified of being out online, it just feels like putting a target on my back. All we want to do is live are life’s with some fucking respect. Why is this so Fucking complicated"	"Couldn't agree more if I'm honest. Im so sorry your coworkers are being horrible to you and hope it gets better.
i’m so sick of talking about it and being told by cis people that i’m dramatic for thinking these anti-trans bills are trying to erase us. they refuse to read between the lines or do any critical thinking at all. they say “it’s just banning drag in public! it has nothing to do with trans people being persecuted 🙄” but refuse to listen when you explain that conservatives & the police dgaf about and don’t know any difference between doing drag and being transgender. they just want us gone. i’m sick and tired of cisgender people gaslighting me and pretending nothing is happening and saying nothing about this.
I agree I feel like this recent political wave of scapegoating’s trans people is part of the radicalization of conservative ideology. I’m hoping it’s just part of the venomous death gurgle of a group of people that are preying on the worst instincts of people to stay relevant.

It still feels like we are at a critical moment and things could go either way. But I really really hope it’s the death cries of a failed ideology and that things will get better. 

I do see a lot of positivity around me. As bad as the anti trans legislation is and the vile rhetoric being spewed. I’m seeing a lot of people stand up to it as a consequence. I personally am seeing people wearing pronoun pins at the supermarket. Im seeing marches and T-shirt’s. I myself am getting fired up. 

These intolerant people and politicians that are trying to light a match will hopefully get burned at their own game as people respond to their intolerance.
I very recently figured out I was nb. And I just am thinking back to an old coworker I used to play D&D with. 

How I said I was gonna play a pan character, and he said ""ok, but don't try to get the group to respect your pronouns"" or the time he really proudly told me that he likes harassing his trans cousin. Constantly trying to debate him on politics. 

Really just the tip of the iceberg with that group, but I'm just so happy that I don't play with that group anymore. I'm not out, but probably the first place I would come out is my new D&D group.
I feel you- I feel like transphobia is everywhere. I live in the San Francisco Area and one of the colleges here is hosting Riley Gaines at an event called “save women’s sports.” I can’t believe the school is hosting this event, it’s fucking San Francisco!! I found a subreddit for the school and posted urging people to email the Dean of students and the vast majority of the responses I got were so transphobic and ignorant about HRT. I tried to calmly explain it to people but they don’t want to listen. I’m feeling so heartbreaking and like, even in the most progressive part of the US we’re seeing regression.
I came out of the closet just under a year ago, and I've been feeling so bad lately, like I'd just crawl back into the closet if I could.  I hate that so much; it's not fair.  The whole last year has been horrifying, and I feel overwhelmed, to say the least.
I’d like to find a more lgbtq space at work.. it’s like I’m surrounded by the straight and boring.  This one woman didn’t even know what Pride meant.. and when our manager told her, she gave a weird mocking laugh.  It’s friggin annoying
""Why does gender have to be included in school, that's not what it's about""

Honestly don't get this line of thinking from transphobes. Gender has always, especially in conservative towns in the Bible belt, been included in schools. Just not the ""trans gender"" version.

When I was a kid, we were constantly grouped in ""girls and boys"". And little kid me always felt off by it. I was already excluded from all the girls in my class due to me having adhd and possible autism. I got along much better with the boys. But for some reason, I wasn't allowed to play with them. Either the teachers enforced this, or the boys themselves did believing a girl couldn't do anything they could do, or believing they'd be gay if they hung out with girls.

I was ridiculed for doing what boys did, playing in the mud, finding snakes and calling them my friends, etc. But I was constantly shoved dresses and barbie dolls.

School always enforced gender. But it was the gender the bigots are *used* to. And now that times have changed they are screaming because now kids have the opportunity to grow up with a support system that, when I was their age, could never have.
I feel the same. I recently came out to my parents( did not work)  and it feels like I'm walking on eggshells whenever I'm in the same room as them, or talk with them. Its terrifying, and it's likely that my fear is miniscule compared to yours.
I’m in a similar situation, I don’t come out to people unless i know for a fact that they are trans or at least allies already. But with all the shit on the news and the fear mongering about trans people I become more and more scared of what might happen if i express myself more openly
The worst part is they don’t even realize how much they are, everyone I work with in completely two faced. In a way I’m glad I got to know what they really think without having to shift through hundreds of sugar coated conversations, but it doesn’t stop it from hurting.
It’s also the fact they keep leaving bills open ended and pretty much refuse to refine and state what they mean in order to continue manipulating the government. I also wish that people could see the bigger picture. At this point it’s not about what you believe. Our rights are human rights, if they come after us, what makes them think they’re safe?
Dogwhistling exists exactly for this purpose. So that idiots that don't want responsibility and their fascist friends can have plausible deniability.
Seems like it's not just conservatives anymore.
ur new D&D group sounds like the dream! 🥰
It’s cause of these “masculinity” groups like Andrew Taint crowd near San Jose area.. they think they saving society by using words like Patriotism and under those umbrellas they hide.. they blame the lgbtq community for every thing and lump pedos in the lgbtq community .. look at this example: 

https://www.instagram.com/p/CqhfD14uAMG/
This is why we need it taught in schools, Queer culture is still on a if you know you know basis and unfortunately the majority of people don’t even bother to look into anything once they’re done with it. 
People are so horribly unaware of our lives and can go their whole lives without ever knowing (or fully knowing) a queer person. 
I’d like it if people could at least get a baseline, let alone just anything about us other then “we exist btw)
We are fighting and fearing the same thing my friend.  Fearing for our safety and well being is never minuscule no matter the situation.
I always test it by brining up stories, seeing how they react to someone who is trans behind their back. Especially since they have no idea I’m non-binary. They just assume I’m cis and then continue to say the most uneducated and disgusting misinterpretation of trans people and gender in general.
Sorry to hear this. I’ve worked with a lot of losers in the past. People who are dumb, robotic, and really uninteresting. 

Work is kinda that melting pot where you can get all kinds of people together. I’m glad I’m working on a better team now where there is positivity and support between people. But I’ve worked plenty of jobs where my coworkers didn’t care if I lived or died.  

Hang in there and I hope you can find a job where you don’t feel this level of toxicity. It’s not easy and jobs change overtime so it’s a constant battle. I just hope you can get in a better place. For me a toxic environment at works follows me home and makes me very miserable.
exactly! it’s much bigger than any of these people who are fighting over meaningless politics release. they’re trying to infiltrate our privacy under the facade of banning tiktok as well and everyone is at risk. it’s just unfortunate that so many people are so willingly ignorant.
thank you for that, truly"	12avi0k	NonBinary	261	0.99	2023-04-03 19:46:55

I wish the NB community would move away from the constant 'masc' 'femme' and 'androgynous' descriptors	"It just feels like Binary Gender 2.0/Gender Binary Lite™. 

Let me tell you that when I found the descriptor ""virid"" (a ""neutral"" gender expression, NOT the same as andro, which is a mix of femme and masc. I'm talking totally unrelated to the gender binary. Think virid as green vs femme pink, masc blue, andro purple.) it totally and completely changed my perspective on gender expression. 

We're taught that dresses and long hair = women/feminine and pants and short hair = men/masculine. What I keep seeing is essentially NB people doing the opposite of what they were told to do for their AGAB in defiance of the gender binary in order to ""look"" nonbinary (can we talk about the concept of ""looking nonbinary""? What does that even mean? It shouldn't be a thing imo just as women and men should have more room for their respective genders). Which, I think a lot of the time can just replicate and reinforce traditional gender roles because we keep saying makeup is femme and short hair is masc. 

People are constantly asking on here ""Do I look androgynous"" ""Do I look nonbinary"" ""I feel like I'm not nonbinary enough"" ""Can nonbinary people do x"" etc. And I think this points to a lot of the confusion that especially questioning people have when they start exploring NB identity. AFAB people feel this pressure to cut off their long hair and get a pixie and AMAB people feel this pressure to wear makeup or grow out their hair or wear skirts, because ""That's what NB people do"".

And these are AWESOME things to do if you genuinely find joy in this! Gender euphoria is always an amazing thing to experience and everyone's idea of what they want to be, look like and feel is different. I know a lot of nonbinary people genuinely enjoy using masc/femme/Andro as descriptors or goals for themselves because it's what they like! And it's how they feel.

But I also think having this ONE, ubiquitous way of describing our looks with no alternatives is harmful sometimes-- I know it was for me, as an AFAB individual I ended up using my NB identity to justify my internalized sexism and thought I was ""basic"" and ""just a woman"" if I had long hair, so I cut mine off and held myself to these really unfair standards for years until I finally figured out what I ACTUALLY wanted to look like and not what I thought I should look like in order to be NB. Now I rock long hair because I just genuinely like it, and saw plenty of men and nonbinary people with long hair and different gender expressions rocking it too, and wear whatever the fuck I want, and I'm still NB.

Anyway, I like terms like virid, the Galactian gender system, and even the sexualities made specifically for NB people (trixic, toric, tiric) which help get rid of the ""do I call myself straight/gay/bi/etc."" issue. I think they help move away from the very binary-centered interpretation of physical appearance and internal feeling. The Galactian system can also sometimes feel like binary 2.0 in a way but at least it attempts to find new language and create new perspectives and interpretations on things we traditionally associate with binary genders. 

I'm a neutrois/agender person; wearing a dress and heels doesn't make me ""femme"" and wearing ripped up jeans, converse and a hoodie doesn't make me 'masc', because I'm not femme or masc-- I'm just a neutrois person wearing clothing that I like. 

I think this can be a difficult avenue to explore because almost all clothing and beauty practices in the world currently have historically been crafted and consumed within the context of men vs women, and even ""gender neutral"" clothing (in the west, usually mean's 'mens clothing'...) isn't necessarily without its associations. And I also understand that there's still use for using these terms for beauty practices we do bc we are still interpreted in a binary way by binary people and that affects our lives in similar ways according to what binary side you might be associated with.

Even when I say I'm looking positively virid to others that might just be, in their minds, masc or femme and they might not know what I mean when I say that because it could mean anything in this case. But I think using alternative language for people who want to do so would be a step in the right direction to give people even more freedom to look or feel how they want.

I look forward to the ways the NB community can continue to break norms and not just in the ""do the opposite of what I've been told to do thereby reinforcing the original system"" but ACTUALLY bringing in new perspectives and crafting new areas of aesthetics that can broaden the aesthetic world into places we've never been before.

Sorry if this came off as ""old man shakes fist at cloud + doesn't offer many solutions"" but I just wanted to vent and see what other people thought. I've just felt a bit alienated particularly from the nonbinary community as of late. Thanks for reading this far!

Edit: I think people are repeatedly misinterpreting my post as saying ""We should abolish the use of femme/andro/masc completely"". That's not what I'm saying. My point is that I wish it weren't the overwhelming majority of the language used in NB spaces at the expense of potential conversations about alternative language for NBs who don't identify with the binary at all."	"I get what you mean, often people (even within the community) talk about nb people as basically two quasi-binary genders where one is ""FTM lite"" and the other is ""MTF lite"". There should definitely be space to make up your own signifiers that aren't based on masc or femme at all.
I do agree with you and I wish it would be a realistic possibility. For me there's more to it though. I'm afab non binary and everywhere I go, I get constantly called ""she"". I fucking hate it. Aside from the fact that my native language doesn't have any neutral pronouns, the only thing that helps me a little in social spaces, is to present myself as masc as possible. Might change after I transioned, might not. What I'm getting at is, that the world we live in, is dominated by the binary system. I don't want to perceived as a girl. Although I'm not a boy, it feels better for me, if people think I'm a boy. Ideally they would respect and recognise me as non binary, but that's not gonna happen with strangers. I think some might feel similar. In order to be perceived in a way that doesn't cause gender dysphoria, I and maybe also other comply to the binary system in our own way.
I dunno like I get what you're saying and agree to the extent that we obviously need to have better vocabulary. But also, I don't think that non-binary means totally unrelated to masc and fem. There's a continuum between the two and it's still useful to use these terms to describe our position along that axis even if it isn't at the binary endpoints.
>I look forward to the ways the NB community can continue to break norms and not just in the ""do the opposite of what I've been told to do thereby reinforcing the original system"" but ACTUALLY bringing in new perspectives and crafting new areas of aesthetics that can broaden the aesthetic world into places we've never been before.

The only way to do this is to design your own clothes and define your own style. Submit designs to actual lgbtq+ positive fashion companies. Start an Instagram or hash tag. Spread designs and spread the word that this is an untapped market and people will try. Sometimes when there isn't something out there you just have to go for it and be open to criticism but still know not everything will suit everyone's style. I'm also agender/neutrois and have been trying to form my own style that completely envelopes me in euphoria. It's slow and will take some time, especially since I have a few medical transition goals. 

I understand it can be a nightmare to sew or tackle things like this but it's SO worth it. What I did to start was make a hidden pinterest board of all the things that gave me euphoria, makeup, clothes, styles, mood boards, bedrooms, anything. Even if it was ""close"" but not perfect I threw it on there. Then I started trying to play with those things in my own style and see what actually felt right on me. If I try something out and end up hating it, I take it off the board. If I try something and it's close, I alter it until I like it. Im not the greatest seamstr/ess so I have my limits currently, though I plan to keep pushing into this and will hopefully come up with some decent designs that others can adapt for themselves.

Final thoughts: It's uncharted territory, which can be both exciting and intimidating. I personally am thrilled to see what kind of stuff we can come up with if we really try!
I really feel this! Even though im comfortable using femme/masc/andro to describe my expression or gender, sometimes it just doesnt feel like it enough or that its quite accurate, and i also have found myself projecting those labels onto others in my mind. I try hard to separate the concepts of gender expression as a trans/queer person from what society has taught me, but i definitely still find myself thinking in a very binary or binary 2.0 way. I really appreciate your post on this, i dont have many thoughts myself to offer but its definitely making me think some and i feel the need to look into virid and other terms of expression that dont rely on the binary system as a comparison. Thanks! :)
I don’t mind using words like femme, masc or andro when talking about exploring your gender presentation because is simply easier when you talk about something so abstract, to me it wouldn’t be useful to get rid of those words. My main issue is how people use or perceive certain terms, I still believe that something being masculine or feminine is extremely subjective. Most stuff traditionally associated with femininity can’t be seen as neutral by most people and that bothers me a lot, to me my gender presentation is androgynous because that’s how I choose to see myself. Ugh, I feel like I’m over the place trying to explain what I want to say, but like you said, I wish people move on from the idea that non-binary is a third gender with more stupid norms. I just want to chill out in a field full of flowers with my titties out and stop seeing posts policing how being non-binary should look like.
I understand your perspective, but don’t personally 100% agree. I think it’s valid to prefer the non “masc/femme” gender language, but that is not going to be every non binary persons experience. I think you see a lot of NB people talking about gender and gender expression using more “traditional” language because many non-binary people do not identify as completely separate from those terms. It’s valid to identify as non-binary and identify with terms like “masculine and feminine” to different extents or not at all.

Just because your personal experience as a non-binary person is more toward neutrois doesn’t mean that other people have that same experience, and that’s going to be reflected in the language this community uses. I understand your feelings, but this does feel like a perspective that does not take into account a good chunk of the non-binary community’s experiences. 

Tldr: I think it’s valid to prefer agender/gender neutral language, but also important to recognize that not all non-binary people identify as completely separate from masculinity/femininity/gendered language.
I think we need to stop asking what we need to be non binary and start saying “this is me and I’m non binary”
like what would mtf have to be femme or ftm masc? what if they like dressing not taht way but are transitioning? Like is osmoene femme masc if they alternate styles?
It would be great to have words for all kinds of gender expressions! I'm personally femme and feel quite connected to that word and don't feel like to me it's ""woman enby"" implying, but completely understand how others don't like terms like masc and femme and andro for themselves. 
For me, it's all about how we tend to view femme VS masc on a sliding scale rather than pinpoints on a constellation of different gender expressions. That's no different than the male VS female binary. 
Femme is more than 'cis people think you're a woman or want to be a woman' so I try not to let cis people change how I see myself. We are infinite 😊
For me personally masculine and feminine are just descriptive words to what we can see, just as tall, petite, etc
These words are not related to gender but they exist which makes it easy to use. I know we need new words but it's hard to just implement them into language because it's not how language works.
We can push them, but if they are actually used in the future is another thing. 
I think it would be easier to get rid of the connection between masculine/feminine and man/woman than to invent new words that only the lgbt community knows about. Because in the end we are part of society and this is how society works.
Atleast that's how i see it.

We just need to teach the world that nothing that exist is binary and that everything that can't be put into boxes.
While I did cut my hair short it's because I wanted to. I got it before I realized I was non-binary and fell in love with the short hair, it was also a way of dealing with trauma, and decided to keep it that way. I do use the terms because I'm comfortable with it for myself. I appear extremely girly but I am fine with that I wear what I want. I just wear whatever I'm comfortable with that day. Some days I don't want to wear a dress and some days I do. I am just being who I am without holding back.
I agree with most of this but masc and fem is useful for a lot of people. Like I'm ftm as in f to masc. I'm nb but lean heavily towards male. For people who do lean towards the binary they are useful but yeah having better words for certain situations would be better
My gender is: tired and just trying to be true to myself as much as possible. 👍
I'm me. Non-binary, dress how I please but the NB is how I feel inside. It fits how I feel like a glove. I don't like pigeonholes and too many descriptors confuse me.  Does it really validate how you feel about yourself to squeeze into very tiny multiple pigeonholes? Probably, for some people who haven't found quite where they fit but for me, NB is awesome and nothing more is needed.  It covers a very broad spectrum!

For me, it's how I feel inside that is more important that the clothes I wear.
yeah, I’ve always been green ;) i don’t try to explain it to people if they don’t want to know — far too great a leap for most people, unfortunately 👽
To u/washa30786 , I can see your comment in my emails but for the life of me cannot find it to reply to on this post lol maybe it's a mobile issue. So I'm replying this way. Hopefully it's actually on here and it's just a me problem! 

I would disagree that nonbinary exists because of the binary, at least not in its entirety. I think for us westerners here and most of the English speaking nonbinary community, that IS the case because the binary has been part of European cultures for a long time, but historically there have been cultures with ""nonbinary"", third gender or otherwise, in our definition, gender non conforming genders, and these are good examples of genders that come from a different perspective and are a different ""flavor"" than many western NB identities that emerged recently because the gender binary wasn't necessarily as much of a thing for them. Even people from other countries like Japan or Spain (random countries off the top of my head that I know have NB communities) might now have different terms or feelings about NB simply due to language difference. So, not every NB identity might have necessarily been precluded by a binary. Nowadays, many have though.

Yeah, as other people have made me realize, I am neglecting a bit the NB who genuinely need these descriptors because it DOES fit them. 

Haha, yeah I totally agree with you on the absolute finickyness and subjectivity of using gendered descriptors only for people to disagree and interpret differently. I think this is just something that each person will have to decide how they want to handle these-- it's kind of the same as how a trans woman might feel like a woman, in her eyes look like a woman, BE a woman, but a transphobic cis man would disagree because his interpretation doesn't match. Doesn't mean saying she's a woman isn't accurate or isn't useful. People will interpret how they want but it's up to YOU to decide how you want to navigate the world. 

I think you posting a selfie but making your gender identity clear would only backfire simply BECAUSE people have these associations for what femme and masc might mean even in the NB community, tho tbh people who post on the NB subreddit and don't """"""""do the NB costuming"""""""" ie don't go out of their way to dress against what society might like of them, they're still accepted warmly and gendered correctly (ex, ""Even tho I'm femme I'm still a them""), tho how each person might see them inside silently might be very individual. I actually think making your identity clear can give a nice cue for others to determine what compliments or gendered language to use for you, such as the determinations you used just when reading my post.

And this is where I think whether or not to keep your identity to yourself is a personal thing. For me personally, I just don't talk about it unless asked 90% of the time in public. Drs appts, grocery store, job, etc. My gender is beyond them, so to speak lol. If someone outright says ""You're a girl"" due to a line of convo or something, I will at that point correct them because it's just wrong. Pronouns are less of a deal for unimportant strangers who dont know my pronouns tho bc like... Who has the energy. Lmao. Only people I work with who I think would be supportive, and close friends and family. 

Thanks for commenting, I like talking about this kind of thing! Lol
I see you. I personally get stuck in a weird place, and I think a lot of other people do to, of things I do because I want to and things I do out of dysphoria. No most people aren’t going to understand my gender and treat me appropriately- but that hurts me so if I try I can atleast make it so I am treated like my agab less often. I think too I have different sets of language- for cis ppl I’m just meeting, for binary trans people, for other non-binary people- I describe myself in different ways and they are all true but they all serve to describe myself to the listener. I don’t need to describe myself to me- I just am, and using words to myself doesn’t make me see myself more clearly.

Idk- so I’m non-binary, asexual, biromantic (attracted to two or more genders) and transmasc. But I’m mostly a lot of things words don’t capture. I look pretty neutral, some people could see me as masc or androgynous- but I just want to look and feel neutral. 🤷
Could you expand on the Galactian system? I found a description online, but it seems basically the same as the normal gender binary, except that 'female' is named for the moon and 'male' named for the sun (maybe its just the specific Wikis I found?). Is virid similar?
I appreciate this post. First of all, I learned some new words. That's always a blessing. Second, I feel like I'm always trying to justify to people that I'm nonbinary because they consider my presentation femme and I am AFAB. I don't feel things considered generally femme have to be considered that forever in society. I'm more comfortable in tighter clothing. I like makeup because it makes it so you can see my eyebrows and eyelashes because I'm blonde not because it makes me look for feminine. There just doesn't always seem to be room for me in this community based on the things you pointed out in your post, but I'm hopeful when I see posts from people like me. It helps to see everyone from every corner of the community. Third, I don't think gender is a spectrum from femme to masc because we don't have to be limited to think of gender just in terms of those things. What about intersex people? They're not broken versions of the other genders - they can be a gender in themselves and that is more how I feel and what I want to emulate in my behavior (less my appearance and more in the ways I interact with the world like my personality). Does that make sense? Loved the post once again, thank you for the learning.
omg thank you for this, I always wear clothes I like and I'm confortable in and I'm tired to hear people say I dress like a woman just because I wear a skirt, I feel amazing in my skirt doesn't mean I'm feminine and not non binary anymore, I didnt leave to binary box to be put in another box!
I absolutely love your thoughts on this! I think I feel similarly to you in regards to having distinct language for my experience that doesn't center binary understandings of expression. Like i just want to express myself and explore expressions that I was not allowed to experience due to the restrictive norms imposed upon me at birth. I think its perfectly valid to articulate your experience using the 'traditional' ways of describing expression (masc, femme, andro) and still recognize your own connection as being distinct from the nominal association to them. Just like if a nonbinary person uses binary pronouns it doesn't mean that they carry the conventional association to these things. I personally believe that someone can completely not relate to the binary and still use the 'traditional' language to describe expression but I do think it's also important to expand our understanding and allow people to have a more intentional and potentially accurate way of reflecting their expressions and identity. 

It's things like this that give me hope and remind me of how much beauty there is in finding intentional ways to reflect your being. I love this community ❤️
My pet peeve is that the community has taken up saying andro as short for androgynous when it means man because the word is a mashup of the binary. Really gets my goat.

You’re far from alone, I generally abhor pinning myself and others down on some gradient of man to woman. But some nonbinary people aren’t as distant from the binary as others. And there’s no hierarchy of “whose experience is more right?” There are a massive amount of nonbinary people for whom these labels do provide useful description of their goals and desires.

It can feel awkward when that’s not you, and confirmation bias + the nature of Reddit provides you with ammo to feel drowned in this terminology, but other people using these words doesn’t say anything about you and what you ‘should’ want, because nonbinary is defined by what it’s not, and you can be incredibly different from 5 other nonbinary folks in the same room. Most nonbinary people understand not to push masc/fem/androgynous labels and descriptors onto others, or they do after a quick discussion of why not to.

There’s another thing at play here, and that’s the bias of this sub towards people at the very beginning of their journey. When I was first figuring this shit out I had “girl days” and “boy days” because I didn’t know how to be my neither self yet. When first expanding past the binary, most people still need it as guardrails and guideposts to begin flexing outside their norm and find what’s better.
This is an interesting discussion because, as I understand it, the very reason why non-binary exists is *because* of the binary. The very reason why I identify as enby is *because* I feel like a mix of boy and girl. For example, if I had to do a somewhat mathematical proof of my gender to someone, I could not do so without using ""feeling like a boy"" and ""feeling like a girl"" or derivatives of those concepts. These are the basic building blocks on which my gender identity is built. And that *is* stupid in a sense, because the very concepts of ""feeling like a boy"" or ""feeling like a girl"" are themelves built upon the very stereotypes I would like to see destroyed in the first place. The problem is that, at least right now, I do need them. It *does* make sense to me to see at least some of my clothes as ""girl clothes"" and others as more boyish or neutral. Similarly, I would assume the very reason why you identify as neutrois is *because* you *don't* feel either like a boy or a girl. The very reason why we are here is because we had to formulate our gender identity in terms of the binary, because this is how we've been raised. You settled for ""neither"" while I settled for ""both"". The fact that it bothers you that people might think of you using gendered terms seems to me like just another pointer towards the fact that you identify with a neutral gender so it makes sense for you to somewhat ""reject"" those terms altogether. That being said, they definitely are useful in my opinion, especially for new enby who still need to refer to the binary because this is all new to them and the binary is the only way they know to perceive the world, at least for now.

That being said, there is something very alluring in being able to talk about gender and gender expression without having to refer to the original binary terms. Being able to say something that basically means ""I'm cute like a girl™"" but without ever using a truly gendered term. I think that would be freeing to some extent, but obviously you would lose the ability to talk with people who are unaware of those new words. I mean, you could always revert to the gendered version but that kind of defeats the purpose.

Actually, what I've seen being done here a lot, and I really like it, is saying things like ""I feel very gender"". To be honest I don't know what that means for sure, but I interpreted as ""I don't really know where I stand on the gender spectrum and I don't care, this style suits me and I feel happy"" and I *love* this approach. I prefer it to the galactian system or any other new words system because, ultimately, gender perception is not universal. For example, some things that I see as ""girly"" or let's say ""female-leaning"", or ""lunarian"", my wife would disagree and say that for her those things are perfectly neutral. Or, the opposite, I do have some clothes that are litteraly labeled as ""men"" that my wife considers to be ""female-leaning"". So this would be a more interesting approach in my opinion: just forgo those concepts altogether. It doesn't help that much to label yourself as ""femme"" or ""lunarian"" or whatever, because people will interpret your gender using their *own* prism anyway. If you say ""I'm lunarian"" and people don't see enough ""lunarianeness"" in your gender expression then it could quickly evolve in an awkward situation, while actually it shouldn't even matter. We are all valid as it is, no matter what label we use, so basically the label serves no purpose outside of our own mind. Therefore, I'd suggest maybe to keep the label to yourself ? For example, if I was to post a selfie of myself right now, while I feel like I'm mixing both feminine and masculine clothings, I'm sure most people would also see a guy with a skinny jean. So basically the label would not help anything and could only backfire in this particular case. I don't think this community would blame anyone for not really physically matching the label we put on ourselves but the point is that the label is useless outside of our own mind. We're all very gender anyway and it's awesome.
We have similar feelings. I want to create a mind eraser where we would forget all of the social programming that has been jammed inside of us and start from neutral. Have it where regardless of anything (e.g., AGAB, the way society thinks you look or should act/dress) you have access and ability to do whatever you want with your body as it seems fit and right to you. I would love if a piece of clothing was just that - clothing. Something you put on your body that doesn’t have a gender. Because why the fuck did clothing become gender?! 

I can understand why some others in this subreddit want to go the opposite of their AGAB because they are also feeling external pressure, as well as internal, to fit what society still expects of them. It’s hard to push off doubts when you are presenting close to your AGAB and are constantly being misgendered and thus experiencing gender dysphoria. Sometimes extremes might seem like the only choice. Who knows. I just try to respect their decisions and know it’s not mine and that’s fine. I will continue to work in my way, in my space for now and maybe leading by example (e.g., confidence in who I am regardless of what society wants me to be based on what I wear) will help someone who is struggling.
And that's why I'm transneutral and neutrois!
Everything is just another binary system to shove us into. People can't help but think in terms of binary systems. Male/female masc/femme. Even binary/non-binary is a damned binary system. It's one easy way for humans to categorize things. We won't escape it until we can release our need for labels & categories. There will always be boxes to be shoved into and labels and people who don't fit them and make new ones and then someone else doesn't fit those and makes their own. So why don't we just stop? Idk. Why think of gender as pink, blue, purple, and green? Why not a gender void. Just nothingness. 

Sorry I'm just rambling.
Finally someone else who I gets it! OMG. I also feel like agender/neutrois is a good descriptor for me.
Yes! I will say I didn’t read the second half, readings is hard for me, but I really get the “I’m AGAB, so I can’t do this thing I wanted to do because it’s associated with that gender”  stuff. I’m afab, and I like wearing makeup, but I’ve always thought that o shouldn’t because associations and everything, or I wouldn’t be “masc” enough
Ugh, yes exactly 😩
Honestly, I get it. I used to say I'd rather be called a boy and have male descriptors used than female because at least I'm not being called a woman. I haven't considered it from the perspective of people who use other languages though-- I likely have privilege of complaining here because the English language has room for it where other languages might not. Because of that room, I've had the ability to discover that honestly, I don't like being called a boy anymore either, because I had space to come to terms with separating my body and other people's perceptions from what I see as my actual reality. Almost as if I'm, y'know, nonbinary! Lmao and not binary, make or female.   
But yeah. Like I mentioned, I don't think masc/femme/andro needs to be gotten rid of entirely, but I just have this giant suspicion that a lot of NBs might also be using those just because again, there's no other alternatives they know of, and it would be nice to see otherwise. In the English language at least :( That doesn't go for people who are CONSCIOUSLY using these because they honest to god like it and made the decision to do so in the face of alternatives. I'm glad you have that safe spot to fall back onto it when it comes to a masc identity or presentation!
Yeah, that's fair. I'm coming at this from the perspective of a neutrois person like I mentioned, and have felt alienated by the continued ubiquity of binary influence on nonbinary communities, but yes there's probably quite a large, if not majority population of the NB community who have connection to masc/fem in some way or another so it's still relative to them.

I think the thing that bothers me the most is that because of the limited language that we have, I get the feeling if I posted selfies here for instance, other NB people would still be interpreting my appearance in terms of masc/femme which is like... I can't escape it! Lol and additionally, just the thought (and evidence that this is happening just from all the posts I see) of newcomers thinking that this is ALL that nonbinary is bc it's the majority of what they see.

Perhaps I'm prioritizing my own perspective here over the perspectives of others. Either way, I do still think more diverse language is needed and I'd like to see more circles where these things aren't the case. There's r/agender but it's still such a small community and isn't quite the same as other NB circles.
Holy crap, that's so awesome! I have so much admiration for people in creative spheres, especially those who work with clothing because it's never been an area I felt confident in unlike with painting or drawing. I love to hear that! 

I think honestly that's one of the biggest ways to go too, right now the NB community is still in its infancy and this was one of things I can't wait to see from people because it can change the way we see fashion. I personally hate altering clothes/sewing/etc unless it's literally painting on fabric 😩 I wish I didnt otherwise I probably would do cool stuff like this and would have less of a hassle just altering my clothes in general! Lmfao
Hey, no problem, and glad to provoke some thought! Tbh there aren't many more descriptors that I know of which has been disheartening, unless you want to count the Galactian descriptors (solarian, lunarian, etc.) But not many people know of that and I suspect many might not like it as it might not be universally relatable + the ""binary roles dressed up in different clothes"" criticism. Hopefully you can find more than I can or maybe eventually people will start coming up with more!
Hell yea babie B)
Yeah, that's fair! I can understand that viewpoint, not everyone will see themselves reflected in this.
Femme or masc can be whatever that means to them. My point here is for NB people to not also feel like they have to use these descriptors when that might not necessarily be their experience. I'm not advocating for people to get rid of femme/masc entirely, just to allow more room for people to use other things if they want and to increase awareness of the alternatives.
😄
My qualm is specifically with the nonbinary community, and not the world population as a whole. NB have adopted plenty of words that we generally only use with each other. That's more my area of concern. That's much more approachable than trying to change English diction on the whole which is not my aim here lol.

I think masc and femme are currently still very tied in with notions of gender. It's how a lot of trans people gauge how well they ""pass"" as their gender.
Hey, that's awesome to hear! I'm glad you found yourself.
My clothes and looks are all figured out and represent me fine. It's being called masc, femme or andro that bothers me because it doesn't suit me at all and it's not true, I'm not those things. It's like being misgendered almost. I almost don't even like being called nonbinary. Lol
Honestly, literally same lmfao
Yeah I used to have plenty of weird display issues on mobile too at some point.

I don't have an extensive knowledge of non-binary genders in other cultures so you might very well be right on that one. I have seen the indian ""two-spirits"" gender been thrown around a lot as a proof that non-binary genders has simply been erased by western society but is nevertheless valid. However, the name itself ""two-spirits"" implies that even then they already had a binary understanding of genders, it just happens that they already got a word to define the people who were outside of this binary way before we did, and that it was a valid accepted gender in their otherwise binary society. That being said, I do not know anything about the history of that particular gender or about any other non-binary gender term in any other language so, again, you might very well be right on that one.

I agree that making your identity clear is useful. I should add some label with ""they/them"" to my account now that I think about it, as I've seen a lot of people do. However, I don't think self-describing your gender expression is that useful. I mean, you don't need to write ""Even tho I'm femme I'm still a them"", because the picture already conveys at least part of your gender expression, and the information about your gender identity can come from somewhere else, like the user labels for example. Gender identity cannot reliably be inferred from gender expression anyway.

Actually, now that I re-read your reply, I feel like you might mean when people use words like ""femme"" or ""masc"" to describe their gender identity ? I don't have a clear understanding of those term when they apply to gender identity rather than gender expression. I have heard of some people labeling themselves ""transmasc"" and ""transfemme"" and I'm not sure I understand what that means. Is it like ""non-binary with a predominently masc/femme gender expression"" ? But then why mix your gender expression with your gender identity ? Or is it like ""non-binary with a predominently masculine or feminine gender identity"" ? But then isn't this very similar to ""demiboy""/""demiman"" and ""demigirl""/""demiwoman"" ? I'm sure it makes sense to the people who use those terms and they are as valid as any other gender. I'm simply genuinely wondering what people truly mean when they use those terms in that particular context.
https://the-mogai-community.fandom.com/wiki/Galactian_Alignment_System

Not sure if you saw that or not. Yeah, it's a redressing   in a way of the binary descriptors, it's specifically a way of saying masc or femme without saying masc or femme, adding a NB spin on it, and adding a whole lot more than that as you'll see if you look at the graphs/list of identities under the system. Kind of in the same way (might be a bad example but not sure how else to put it) that, say, outsiders might interpret fa'afafine and hijra both as ""third gender"" but the flavors are distinctly different because they have different cultural contexts, and are not the same thing, even though they're both often categorized as ""third gender"". Femme and lunarian can be similar or different, just depends one the individual using it.

I still don't think it's a perfect system though bc of the redressing issue. But I do like that it attempts to broach the issue. Honestly, until femme and masc get broadened in our wider culture over time, this language issue might persist because the underlying systemic framework isn't changing with our language. :(

Virid isn't related to the Galactian system, no. It's kind of its own thing lol.
Yeah it makes sense! Glad to provide more sense of community for you :)
😊
Yeah no, everything you've said here is totally right! And is a very fair point lol. Thank you for adding that.
Yeah, I understand people going the opposite too because I literally did it too. I guess from my perspective as someone who came out the other side and saw it for what it was, I'm probably judging too harshly because you kind of just have to make the mistakes before learning from it, lol at least from the people who that kind of thing it ISN'T right for.

I agree with p much everything you said haha.
My goal would be to think like you about people's perceptions; I get you point and I wish I could be like that, but maybe it's possible for me after the mastectomy. Things seem to change after one is freed from crippling dysphoria^^
As a gender fluid person, i live my identity through masc and femme. Its a unique experience for everyone. I honestly dont see the need to stray away from masc or femme because those are two things that help us define our gender identity in the first place! Just because we are non binary doesnt mean we have to do away with the two ends of the spectrum . Some days im a woman some days im a man some days im both 🤷 not sure how it would be described without the use of the two idenities
And what does Solarian/Lunarian mean? Is it just masc and femme respectively, without saying masc and femme? What system does it use? There's multiple old faiths where the moon is male and sun female, including my own, while in others it's the reverse. So would I have to go against my personal beliefs in order to use this galactic system?
Ive definitely heard of galactian because i was looking up a bunch of pride flags and labels and i really liked a lot of the celestarian system genders, sexualities, etc. Galactian was probably linked/recommended but i didnt super look into it at the time, and i haven't heard the term virid before or many other galactian terms to my knowledge. Im definitely gunna have some fun researching more on these and maybe ill find more i identify with!
I hope you have a great day 😊
I was glad too. It took well over a year of questioning myself and growing to accept that. I'm glad you found yourself too.
Yeah, I get where you're coming from. I guess I made my point badly - basically that I don't find MASC/femme etc helpful at all. I do like NB however as it covers a massive amount of different scenarios:)
Nah, I meant when people say ""Having a masc day"" or ""I love looking femme"" or ""What are femme things I can wear"" or ""Am I nonbinary if I dress masculine"" etc. 

Not trashing these people for saying these things and being honest about how they feel, that would be stupid, and some things are kind of hard to NOT say like that bc in order for a language to be effective, everyone has to know what the words mean (like asking for femme clothes communicates an idea quickly and will probably get what the poster wants, probably isn't the time to use non gendered language or it would be confusing.). My gripe was how that seems to be the only lens a lot of NB people see gender expression for everyone, that everyone has to use these labels bc nothing else exists and that a lot of people just seem to think being NB is being either a third gender in between boy or girl (androgyne essentially) or boy/girl lite. For many people that might be true but there's almost this blindness to agender people's perspectives, for instance, and I think ONLY having fem/andro/masc as descriptors in the NB community and almost nothing else is almost odd for how much many of us want to ""smash the binary"" and for such a unique, diverse bunch lol. 

Transmasc/transfemme generally indicates people who feel somewhat attached to male/female concepts but not necessarily in the way a man or woman would be, or yes, kind of just fits gender expression in there because that pointer I made about language having to be widely known to be effective. Like, I can be agender but call myself transmasc if I'm taking testosterone  for indtance. For some, demiboy or demigirl can fit and that can include them also, but for others the feelings are more nebulous, they might not like the name or description or otherwise just might not like being specific or care, it's an easy way of tipping someone off to their general identity.
Thanks for that description! It's really helpful. Yup, that's the site I saw.

I think it's a fantastic idea to develop a gender system that avoids thinking in terms of masc/femme, but it's really hard to implement in a way that doesn't reinforce existing binary stereotypes. 

A lot of it could be unconscious associations - like, with the sun/moon thing in the galactic system, I guess the idea was that the creators were thinking of interchangeable star signs. But it makes me a bit uncomfortable to say that ""masculine"" is this giant powerful source of light that rules the entire solar system, while ""feminine"" is this tiny rock that helplessly revolves around the sun because its influence is so strong.

I guess someone could try developing a gender system that is based on self-perception, personal traits, and self-presentation, but again, there's a big risk that they would still have masc/femm associations, and could come across as even more restrictive than the traditional binary.

 I guess one advantage of the masc/femm binary is that although they do have their rigid stereotypes they have changed so much over the centuries and have basically always been challenged, so there are so many flexible models of masculinity/feminity to follow.
Right, totally get it. It’s a hill we don’t have to die on because people need to grow and learn on their own. We can’t even change peoples minds. Can you imagine where you were, trying out the far far side of the “gender spectrum”, and someone tried to convince you otherwise? You might have resisted and gone further down a path that you (much) later found out was not for you. 

It’s a painful journey for all of us, and you and I as well as some others, are fortunate enough to come out the other end with our true selves intact. But I think as creatures we are always altering ourselves through change and growth and I can never say I won’t go to an extreme again. I think it might be less likely as I am very happy with who I am, but I can’t ever count it out.
That's another perspective I haven't considered! The only times I feel dysphoria now are in social situations and when I did feel dysphoria with my body, it was actually self-induced because of what I was talking about above-- the pressure to look more masculine in order to be a ""true"" NB if you're AFAB. I considered testosterone because I wanted to ""erase"" my current body but I'm glad I didn't go through with it, because it wasn't a nonbinary issue, it was a sexism issue. 

I hope you can get relief from that burden after having time with your new physical form :) Having crippling dysphoria I'm sure just makes everything that much more complicated and I can understand that it might necessitate more black and white thinking for people, and so I might have a different perspective here than others. Thanks for mentioning that!
I can't say whether it's something that would go against your faith or not, I think that's something you personally would have to decide. 

https://the-mogai-community.fandom.com/wiki/Galactian_Alignment_System
Yay! :)
☺️
Yes! Lol 

I do disagree with that interpretation of sun vs moon. Not everything has to be about size or strength, and you don't have to take it literally a la the actual scientific properties of our celestial bodies lol. It can just be more the IDEA of the two. I mean hell, your lunarian could be the moon that eclipses the sun, or the blood moon. Your sun could be a dying star or the sun at dusk. Etc. Lol
And I thank you for your nice words. It's great to know there are awesome people like you in the world. I really appreciate conversation like this - no fighting over arguments, just exchanging point of views in a nice, civil way and enrichen each other's thoughts.
Maybe changing our expectations to be acknowledged for who we are and how we feel by everyone is the key?

A coworker apparently had a ton of beauty procedures done (less than me but mine are subtle and invisible). And I noticed how she struggles with being shamed for it. So I showed her some scars on my nose (was part of ffs) and she opened up with about even her multiple BA and we connected about that topic. 

My point is she is cis but also has to deal with not being accepted by everyone. Maybe its a mistake to want that as it makes me uncomfortable and unhappy, and focus on those who are supporting.
That's my point though. You've said you want everyone to move to that system, as opposed to just you, but that system doesn't fit everyone. It would mean that I, a distinctly not male, more female but still not - hence femme, not female - would have to use an effectively male gender designation. Having to use this system would effectively be me having to give myself dysphoria, and dead gender myself, every time I discussed my gender. I'm less worried about it going against my faith and more worried about it going against my mental health. 

I don't have a problem with a different designation system, though I can't think of any way of them being any better than our current one. They'd have to be very abstract which has its own problems, or stereotypical which has its own worse problems. I think femme/masc/andro are good because it refers to presentation, I understand while disagreeing with your issues, but I genuinely can't think of a better alternative.
This system is interesting thanks for sharing the link
Aww, thanks, and likewise. Yeah that shit's rare on Reddit sometimes lmao.
That's awful! I've also looked at having beauty procedures done but the judgement from other people is insane, particularly for women. You're only worth kindness, admiration and respect as a woman or femme if you're hot but if it's not effortless then you're high maintenance, vain, selfish and mentally ill. That's sad to hear.
I'm a bit confused. A male gender designation? What do you mean?
Yes, I got a lot of close people scared about me and my mental health when I decided to have FFS. Including some trans people. 

Then after it they where extremely relived I still look like me and not like a instagram model or something… it was all about them and their judgments.

Edit: The way I see it is that makeup or surgery will not change your insecurities. But it definitely changes how others view you. Like everyone has  perfect teeth these days… in the 60s you would see people who had natural teeth on film and tv.

If you want something done just get it and ignore the haters as they are just envious you took control of your life.
The moon is male in my beliefs (and many other old beliefs), but based on the link you provided, a femme enby would be lunarian. So I have to be a moon person, but the moon is male with my beliefs, so if I designate myself a moon person, I'm saying I'm a male person.
For sure.
Ohh, I see. Sorry, I thought I was looking at a different comment line so lost the context of this convo.

Never anywhere did I say I wanted people to move en masse to the Galactian system, or really even as a solution to this problem. I personally have my own issues with it which I've stated before (lack of relatability [as your case kind of could be construed as] plus references and reskins to [western] binary concepts). I've been using it as an example of a system that is attempting to address the issue that I've brought up here, and to therefore show that it is possible, either as a current potentiality or a future one that would necessitate further development of the NB community + cis people's education on these kinds of things. Again, not as a solution because it is not haha!
Oh, and as for your point about a ""replacing"" system instead of femme/andro/masc and the issues with finding a suitable one, yeah I agree with that. My focus wasn't on, again, getting rid of those terms (title of my post relies on the presence of the word ""constant"" there lol) but adding more language (hence my focus on 'virid' as an example) and increasing awareness of alternative methods of descriptions. And yeah, the issues you mentioned are an obstacle. I'm not claiming to sit here and have the solutions since this was just a rant + I'm not really an ideas person, I wanted to start a conversation about this phenomenon so that hopefully more people can think about it and hopefully, with more conversations like this, the community as a whole can decide what it wants to do, what direction to go in and hopefully that will include more people like me who don't feel attachment to the concepts discussed here."	tlxkfz	NonBinary	252	0.96	2022-03-24 04:24:14
Daily reminder that not all non-binary people have to look androgynous.	"You can be a very feminine or masculine person and still be non-binary. You can lean to one side of the spectrum more, but that does not make you invalid. I'm a more feminine demigirl (although I do have my masc days), and that's completely okay.

*Your appearance has nothing to do with your identity!*

🌸"	"This is the kind of validation I needed today, thank you. 💖
Thank you, this made me feel so much better. When I first realized I was nonbinary I was leaning very masc, but lately I’ve been wanting to dress and present much more femme again and it’s got me questioning my identity. Thank you for reminding me I can be a basic white girl AND still be my enby self 💜
if only we all looked like we actually wanted to look, right? 
thank you so much!!!! i’m trying so hard to accept this about myself rn!! 
So true!!!! 💚❤️💙💜😌
AMEN! Thank you for the PSA! <3
💖💖💖
I've been super femme lately and this is just so.. everything I needed. Thank you 💜
Thanks so much, I needed this
Thanks, I try to remind myself of this all the time...to varying degrees of success.
Always good to hear <3 I'm feminine as hell, I love wearing cute dresses and blouses and everything. I'm starting to branch out a little into traditionally ""masculine"" clothing, but even there I don't usually look androgynous. 
This is the best thing I’ve seen on reddit today! We are a beautiful, diverse community, and each of us brings unique presentation to the table 🌈💞 you rock OP!
I love reminders like these! Thank you!
Often I wonder, how do you have to present yourself to be Enby?  Can't I just express myself and how I am feeling and still be accepted.  If ""girly things"" and ""boy things"" are to be truly non gender, I should be able to just be and not feel like I have to be androgynous.  

&#x200B;

Often men's clothing are just not as comfortable as women's and so I prefer wearing legging and long skirts.  I guess I choose things more for what feels good and makes me happy and not just to express how I identify.  
That makes me feel better. Thanks again!
 To others I come off (physically) very femme but lean more masc mentally & energetically - ty for much needed reminder xx 
I was sitting here wondering if I could really be non-binary if I feel non-binary, but AFAB and pass as female and like my boobs and curves so long as they don't live in overtly feminine clothes (no dresses please) and have no interest in changing pronouns right now.
Sounds like you're saying the answer is yes.
Still a barely conceived notion here and yet one I've had for my whole life at the same time.
Thanks
Thank you, I've been feeling quite insecure about how masc I generally look so this hit at the right time
I’m glad it helped!!
I relaaate! I’m glad this helped you feel more comfortable with yourself!
Exactly... Things I definitely need to remember! ❤
Exactly! And a lot of that is how I feel, yet I still identify as non-binary. And that's awesome!"	9kv0m5	NonBinary	249	1.0	2018-10-02 21:49:51
On it / its / itself pronouns.	"I saw some questions about this in another subreddit and thought I'd take my comment and expand on it here for anyone who is curious about this.  Note that these are my personal feelings on using ""it"" pronouns, and other peoples' opinions may differ.

**""It / its / itself"" is only for non-living objects, right?**

Not necessarily.  Most animals are referred to as ""it"" in every day speech - even animals that are sentient, self-aware, and can even communicate (such as parrots or monkeys).  Plants are also referred to as ""it"", even though they are alive.  Furthermore, in ancient texts such as the Bible, angels, demons, and talking animals (such as The Four Living Creatures) are also often referred to as ""it"", despite being unquestionably alive and sentient.

Further, this argument bears resemblance to ""he is only for boys"" and ""she is only for girls"" - language is always changing and does not remain static.  Plus, pronouns are special in that they can be used for many types of people; plenty of nonbinary people use gendered pronouns.

This argument also bears resemblance to ""they is only for multiple people"".  Not only has this been incorrect for a long time (just like ""'it' is only for inanimate objects"" has been incorrect for a long time), even if it *was* a correct sentiment, words can change.  Language is not concrete - it is always evolving and adapting to new changes in society.

**Isn't ""it"" demeaning and dehumanizing?**

Not for me.  I see people refer to animals and plants as ""it"" - the Earth and planets as ""it"" - the universe as ""it"".  She/he/they are ""for humans"", but why?  Is the line dividing animals, nature, and humans that strict?  I like the idea of being another entity in the world - not above or below other things, but with them.  ""It"" makes me feel closer to nature in a gender-neutral way.

Yes, objects are referred to as ""it"", but many other things are too, particularly in mythology.  [Here is an example](https://books.google.com/books?id=8QZLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA336&lpg=PA336&dq=%22it+spoke%22+myth&source=bl&ots=7FoCz75Bg3&sig=ACfU3U1Ry7LY2JlGR585Q4nqq2fAV2iZWw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0ttXqmcPgAhVxUd8KHWLgBqYQ6AEwB3oECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22it%20spoke%22%20myth&f=false) of a Scandinavian myth in which Odin and Loki encounter a ""human-headed eagle"".  *""Give me my share of the feast,"" it said, ""and the meat shall presently be done"".*  The creature is alive, sentient, and shares the appearance of a human - but it is referred to as ""it"" to indicate a lack of gender.  To me, that sentence sounds natural still - the creature is undoubtedly alive and important and real, but simply genderless and another entity in the world.

**Even if you don't think it's dehumanizing, most people do.**

Maybe.  But most people don't think there are more than 2 genders.  That doesn't mean that they are correct, or that people should live their lives according to what most people think and do.  

Pronouns are a personal choice intrinsic to you and you alone.  Many men would never want to be called ""she"" - it feels wrong to them, it removes the legitimacy of their identity in their eyes.  That doesn't mean that someone else can't use ""she"", and it doesn't mean that ""she"" is a bad, dehumanizing pronoun.  Pronouns are about what you want to be called, and how you see yourself.  If you don't see your pronouns as dehumanizing, then they are not dehumanizing for you.

**Couldn't you just use ""they""?**

Yes.  It doesn't feel as right to me, though.  Personally, ""they"" always struck me as too ambiguous, not concrete enough.  To me, ""they"" seems more like you're referring to an abstract concept or placeholder (""one should always make sure they wash the dishes after eating"") or someone you don't really know (""I met someone today."" ""Oh, who are they?"").  Personally, to me, it's too general - I like ""it"" because it's concrete and definite - you are talking about something specific.  And as I explained above, ""it"" does not feel demeaning or dehumanizing to me.  I am a human still, I am alive and my thoughts are real, regardless of the pronouns used for me.

**But ""it"" has been used to dehumanize trans people.**

This is true, and it's horrible.  I myself have actually been subject to the derogatory use of ""it"" to indicate non-humanness in the past - it surprised me when I realized I don't mind it now, even though I did back then.  It's important to remember that *all* pronouns have been used to dehumanize and delegitimize trans people.  Calling a trans woman ""he"" is belittling, horrible, and delegitimizing.  However, ""he"" is still a valid pronoun to use if it suits you, because it is not the pronoun itself that is bad, but the way the person is using it and the intentions they are using it with.

**You can't expect people to call you ""it"", and you shouldn't call other people ""it"".**

I would never, ever call someone ""it"" unless they specifically requested it.  Similarly, I understand that very few, if any, people will call me ""it"".  What other people do and think, however, does not invalidate what I feel and what I think my truth is.  The point is not for everyone to respect my pronouns - although that would be nice - but for me to understand who I am and what feels right to me.

I'd also like to say that **I do understand that this word can be hurtful** to many NB and trans people; I don't really ask people to call me these pronouns because I understand the connotations that many people have.  I liken it to the word ""queer"" - many people hate it because they were called that in the past, but many people identify with it because they find the word freeing and accurate to who they are.  I find this set of pronouns accurate to who I am, and while I'd like people to accept and use them, I accept other pronouns because it makes so many uncomfortable."	"I’m sorry you were banned for speaking on *your* pronouns that *you* feel comfortable with using for *you*. That’s ridiculous. 
I find this interesting since I've never seen anyone explain why they use it pronouns, but I do find some of your points a bit strange! 'It' is not for inanimate things, it's for non-human things? And most people use he/she/they pronouns for their pets or other non-random animals precisely because they personify them to some degree. I would find it really weird if someone called their own dog an it. But that might just be my culture. 

Of course, I'm cool with language evolving when people need/want it to. But I think it's a difficult one because 'it' can be so genuinely triggering to trabs/nb/gnc folk so it will probably be a long time before many people feel comfortable using it, even for other people. I've been called an it before and yeah..... it stung. I think it's pretty common, sadly. 

How do you feel about your pronouns potentially making other people uncomfortable because of their own bad experiences? 
I have a hard time with it/its pronouns myself but I find it absolutely outrageous that you would be banned for speaking sincerely on *your own* preferred pronouns for *yourself*.  That's just...wild.
I also like 'it' as a pronoun, but it makes most people uncomfortable and 'they' is just as good to me, so I just tell people to use 'they'. I might even like 'it' more if it caught on more, but I feel I can't use it because people will find it too weird.

I think the only reason 'it' seems dehumanizing is because we're so used to the gender binary that to most people, to imply something has no gender is to imply it's not human.

We've adapted 'singular they' instead of 'it'. Singular they works well because it doesn't have the dehumanizing connotation that 'it' does. But before 'they' started being used for non-binary people, it was used in cases where the subject was hypothetical like ""If someone comes to the door, tell *them* we're closed and *they* can come back on Monday."" or when the gender of the subject is unknown, like ""I did not reply to *their* message right away because *they* sent it at 4 in the morning.""

This makes it sometimes feel to me like using 'they' is implying the person's gender is unknown, but my gender is known\*. 

I don't see why 'they' is better than 'it', and if your post to /r/genderqueer was the same as here, I don't understand why you were banned.

\*^(actually I'm still a little unsure about it but that's a discussion for another time)

&#x200B;
I find it disgusting that you were banned for speaking about your pronouns. I would also like to add another point in favour of it/its pronouns:   


**Not all languages have an equivalent to they/them pronouns.**  


Some people use it/its pronouns in the other language(s) they speak and especially if that language is their native, it makes sense that they might prefer the direct translation since that is what they are accustomed to and that is the way they view themselves.
We're opening this thread back up for regular discussion. A couple things:

1. In its behavior with users and r/nonbinary mods, greyrust has given us no reason to believe its actions have been in bad faith. We do not interpret greyrust's OP nor its subsequent behavior here as calling for brigading or instituting a witch hunt. 

2. It's normal to want to vent if you believe you've been treated unfairly and normal to want to sympathize if you agree with the person venting. However, in some comments below, a mod from r/genderqueer says that r/genderqueer's modbox has been getting hatemail. If true, this isn't an appropriate response. Neither is brigading. Either of those things will get you banned from r/nonbinary. 

3. The topic of this post is definitely controversial. The actual discussion content of this thread has been, in my opinion, really thoughtful. Thanks to all you who participated. 

Edit:

javatimes said this below, but since this comment is sticked I'll place it here as well: ""[We] ask that all parties refrain from continuing arguments.""
I've been pronoun agnostic for a while with minor aversion to it/its and this post is persuading me to include that in my ""any pronouns"". I know several people that use it/its for themselves but all of them include it in a multiple-pronouns-are-equally-OK deal and I admit that I usually default to one of their other options. I should revisit why I do that. 

Super disappointed about the controversy over this very reasonable post. 

To elaborate a little 

I think the most novel and convincing part of this discussion for me is the bit about ""ambiguous subject"" vs ""known subject"". That's sort of the reverse of why i *don't* use ""enby""-- i find that word is too concrete for a variable and fluid experience in many cases. It gets used in a way that looks like a stand-in for ""Third Gender"". So I choose the less-personified ""nonbinary"" and usually only as an adjective. It's interesting how not only gender connotations but ""specificity"" is at play in choosing what words are appropriate for us.

This is a really cool post and I appreciate you taking the time to write it! I feel like I understand much better why some people actually like “it” as a personal pronoun. 

I especially loved reading your point about nature and human beings not actually being separate, and that “it” as a personal pronoun can communicate that concept of universality amongst living things. 

I feel that same way about “they” as my pronoun—on the one hand, it’s most comfortable for me personally, but on the other hand it also resonates with my view that people of different genders are not actually that different, and language that keeps us strictly categorized prevents us from seeing each other as members of one human in-group. 

Thanks again for sharing!
Why would this be banned? Even if someone doesn’t agree, you have a well-thought-out opinion on this that deserves to be heard and respected.
Huh.  This is a really great post. I use they/them for exactly the reason you don't: I love that it's vague and amorphous and says very little about me. And now that you phrase it/its as the other side to the same coin, I feel so much more comfortable using it/its for other people. I don't think it's for me, but I *get it* now. 

I also love the very radical aspect of using it/its to help break down the divide between humans and the rest of the planet. I use genderqueer for similar reasons that are equally personal and political. 

Thanks for posting this! (Unexpectedly, this also takes some of the sting out of the times I've been referred to as it with an intent to harm. Basically having another way to frame it/its pronouns makes it hurt less.)
r/linguistics

Hi, what is your first language?

My first language has only one word for she/he/they(singular)/it.
I also found this interesting since, like others here, I haven't seen anyone explain their preference for it pronouns in such detail. I especially connected to the bit about  being another entity in the world - not above or below other things, but with them. I still don't know if I'd use it pronouns for myself (maybe one day after some thought, who knows?), but they're valid if they make you comfortable! That's definitely ridiculous you were banned for talking about your own pronouns, wtf. 
The [dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/it) seems to agree with your use of it

> a person or animal whose sex is unknown or disregarded
~~Well honestly I'm glad that mod commented because I know I should unsubscribe from r/genderqueer now.~~

It pronouns are still weird for me, because I get that pang of ""I'm saying something bad!"" In my chest. That feeling doesn't seem to get overridden by the fact that 'it"" is how you *want* to be referred to. Maybe it's because these pronouns are so uncommon?
kind of sad that i missed out on reading the original post,

is there any way i could see the text of it?
I know this post is ancient, but to me this post was very enlightening! I've been struggling with finding my own identity and what it is I am comfortable with. Whilst thinking about this for the 100th time I suddenly had the revelation of it/its, decided to look it up to see if it was a thing, and therefore stumbled upon this post.

Thanks to you, I have finally gotten a satisfying answer to a problem I've had my entire life, thank you!
THIS!!! THIS SO SO SO MUCH!

Edit:  
ADKFVALFW I just realized I'm very late but still!  
This applies and is absolutely the base of my reasoning.

Apart from that, I also know many people around me think of me as a respectable person, so when I tell them I use it/its pronouns, I hope they have a moment of realization, and/or gain just a little more respect for beings labelled ""it"" simply by connotation :)
Outsider of the community, would the correct thing to put in the bio not be ""it/it""? she/her, she talks, I talk with her, he/him, he talks, I talk with him, it talks, I talk with it. Just grammatically, it would not make sense to write ""it/its"" would it?
I think it is very insensitive and discriminatory to compare people who identify as ""it"" to animals. When some one says ""my pronouns are it/its,"" do you think you yourself, ""They are just like animals."" What you are essentially doing here is looking at a *human* and saying that they are nothing more than a dirty rat. And what if the person were African-American? Why do you think that black people are animals?
The comments are getting closed for now. If they are reopened, I ask that all parties refrain from continuing arguments.
I would rebut that your argument against “they” pronouns is equally as baseless as you argue the common stance against “it” pronouns to be. 

If language is always changing, and *many many people verifiably prefer they/them pronouns,* then to say it’s wrong because “they” refers to an ambiguous entity is just as prescriptivist as “it pronouns are always wrong because it usually refers to things in generic or which are considered low on the animacy hierarchy of our language.”

Source: Linguist, wrote my final paper on the origins and validity of singular “they”. 
Question: would saying 'it' cause ambiguity? Like, the word 'it' can also be used to refer to ideas or subjects which could cause ambiguity. 

Imagine if you're talking about a non-binary person building a DIY bookshelf.  
""It's probably a good idea for it to double-check its measurements before cutting it. It might not end itself up with the right length if it doesn't have its proportions right.""

This could cause ambiguity and confusion, right? Not tryna sound offensive or dehumanizing, it's just a legit question.
>**Even if you don't think it's dehumanizing, most people do.**
>
>Maybe. But most people don't think there are more than 2 genders. That doesn't mean that they are correct, or that people should live their lives according to what most people think and do. 

Humans are also a highly social species, and the social aspects of not only language, but one's own psychology, doesn't really work that way.

>Pronouns are a personal choice intrinsic to you and you alone. 

Not really. That's not the purpose of pronouns in any given language. The city of Toledo, Ohio, has no choice in how one refers to her, and under certain animistic beliefs, she's not only just as sentient as you or I or even the cows on the old dairy farm where my step-by-step grew up, but the nature of her existence makes her of either Sapient (human-like) or Supersapient intelligence. I don't refer to that city as ""she,"" for her sake, but both to convey to my audience a broadly-accurate idea of how I relate to her (after establishing she's the subject of my statement), and also so that I don't have to instead type out:

>*The city of Toledo, Ohio, has no choice in how one refers to the city of Toledo, Ohio, and under certain animistic beliefs, the city of Toledo, Ohio, is not only just as sentient as you or I or even the cows on the old dairy farm where my step-by-step grew up, but the nature of the city of Toledo, Ohio's, existence makes the city of Toledo, Ohio, of either Sapient (human-like) or Supersapient intelligence. I don't refer to that city as ""she,"" for the sake of city of Toledo, Ohio's intelligence, but both to convey to my audience a broadly-accurate idea of how I relate to the city of Toledo, Ohio (after establishing the city of Toledo, Ohio, as the subject of my statement), and also so I won't have to type out or speak ""the city of Toledo, Ohio,"" over-and-over-again, like I just did.*

The reason that interpersonal pronoun preferences are usually honoured by others is cultural: Anglophonic society —especially in the United States— has an especial reverence for the individual, even, if not moreso, as a cultural concept (which, even under the principles of Chaos magic, doesn't even have true sentience, much less Sapience) than necessarily *just* individual human beings. This cultural reality thus illustrates further issues with ""it"" being applied to individual humans with established or forming personalities (as there's an arguably antiquated habit of referring to infants and toddlers as ""it,"" but this habit gradually phased out when Western rates of infant mortality began to plummet, with the introduction of vaccination to replace immunisation):

When one EFL human refers to another as ""it,"" in English, this is typically a slur. It's an act of verbal violence —typically motivated by racism or transphobia— that is being committed to deny the target any basic dignity of individual personhood. When such is one's individual preference, that's an action typically coming from an unconscious train of thought that removes oneself from an experience of individual personhood.

A living language may grow and evolve with use, but it's FAR more nuanced and happening from the psychology of a particular society —not merely the preference of an individual member of that society— than you're willing to acknowledge. Your understanding of how languages, and their social constructions work is simplistic to the point of absurd. 

Language is the penultimate social construct, and it exists for such fundamentally social purposes, that to ignore that completely, in favour of ***a language's any one individual speaker, and that person's preference in how others speak of oneself,*** to the point that one refers to such a preference as being ""intrinsic"" to one's sense of personhood, is so patently nonsensical that it directly contradicts *literally everything* that you said in your post!

This isn't even taking into account the fact that many languages have a linguistic gender. Furthermore, within that group, there are many languages that also have no separate word between an equivalent for the English ""she"" or ""he,"" and the definite article (such as the pronouns of ""it"" and ""that"") for words that are linguistically ""feminine"" or ""masculine,"" respectively. If I were to have a conversation *about you* with someone who, like myself, speaks Welsh —which in ""ef"" has no distinction between between the English ""he"" and the English ""it"" for a linguistically masculine article, and in ""hi"" lacks any distinction between the English ""she"" and ""it"" for when speaking of a linguistically feminine article— which form of ""it"" do you want my hypothetical companion and I to refer to you with? As **you clearly don't speak anything but English,** it's also not your place to put in your own 2¢ on how other languages — *especially* not historically and *actively colonised and marginalised* languages— ought to grow and evolve. 

Sorry, but without an adequate alternative gender-neutral pronoun option from *actual speakers of Welsh,* those are your choices in how you'd prefer those seeking to honour your preferences, **but** who are *speaking about you* in a language that is neither one you speak, nor one that distinguishes between ""he or it"" or ""she or it"" —are you to be ""ef"" or ""hi""? If neither are acceptable to you, and assuming that actual speakers of Welsh (which clearly doesn't include yourself) haven't devised an alternative to your liking, then that ultimately proves that **the only thing that pronouns are ""intrinsic"" to, is the language that they're a part of.** That's how literally all languages work —and they're each far bigger than any individual speaker.

While the existence of languages that both a) have linguistic genders, and b) don't distinguish between (for example) a human who is generally referred to by an equivalent to the English ""she"" versus a non-human definite ""feminine article,"" that would typically be translated to the English ""it,"" *does* support your apparent argument that... 

>>""distinct pronouns for human versus non-human life is a social construct, thus one *should* honour the preference of those who prefer to be referred to as 'it',"" 

...well, this **also** means that... 

>>""distinct pronouns for human versus non-human life is a social construct, meaning that the nuanced social implications of languages that *do* typically distinguish between 'he/she' and 'it,' carry **a social statement about personhood and individuality that extends beyond the preferences of any one individual speaker of that particular language,** as much as *lacking that distinction* between 'she/he' and 'it,' carries a nuance about the culture and society that coexists with that language, which likewise extends beyond the preferences of any individual speaker of that particular language.""

To so staunchly fight against the fundamentally social nuance of English —or any other language— as your post advocates doing, is —to pick up on the nuanced meaning of a word— *intrinsically anti-social,* which suggests a psychological origin to your preference to be called ""it.""
Head mod of /r/genderqueer here. OP wasn't banned because of their pronouns, OP was banned for making a post that looked like the sort of troll posts we get on /r/genderqueer fairly regularly, and behaving similarly, so our mod in question took them for just another troll.

Instead of appealing their ban, OP then went to two other non-binary subreddits to complain about it and stir up more trouble, leaving both up for several hours before PMing me to override our mod's ban.

I'm currently looking into the issue and am waiting to see how OP will respond before making a decision on the matter.

**It's not about the pronouns, it's about the behavior.**

-----

**Edit:** Alright, here's how this looks on our end:

We attract a fair amount of trolls who do things like post things they know will be inflammatory, just to cause a ruckus. It's a form of trolling called 'Just Asking Questions' or 'Sealioning.'

How it works is they go in, post something that looks legit, but they know will be inflammatory, and then go start an argument in the comments. Then, when they get banned for it, or when anyone gives them any grief about it, they throw their hands up and say 'hey, I was just asking questions!' or 'it's just my opinion!'

And then their target looks bad because it looks like you've banned them for their opinion, and they can run to other subreddits and be like 'I totally had a legit question and they banned me for it! Those people are scum!'

(This is a favorite tactic of online trolls; you can see it in action several times a week on /r/subredditcancer, for example.)

So what happened here is the poster got their post flagged by AutoMod because they have no posting history on our sub and little posting history in general. They looked like a JAQ troll, so our mod banned them.

OP then messaged our modmail, insulting our community, and asking why they were banned. Our mod explained why they were banned, and OP didn't like that. OP sent back another insult, exactly as any troll would do, and our mod muted them for it.

OP then ran off into two other subreddits and tried to get a witch hunt going. Again, trying to damage our community. They lied about our mods, saying we had banned them over their pronouns, which is utterly ridiculous; we would *never* ban someone over their pronouns.

But we *do* ban people over poor behavior. We've told OP that, but it isn't listening. I've offered to lift the ban and chalk it up to miscommunication, but OP doesn't want that, either.

I went to check out this issue for the OP, at their request, and I explained exactly what the previous mod did. 'Hey, your post looks like a troll post, we get these things kinda often, so it's possible that your post got pulled by mistake.' OP didn't want to hear that, and didn't want to listen to anything I had to say, preferring to insult me and continue to slander our community for trying to help sort this out for them.

I've asked it to stop attacking our community and agree to follow our subreddit's rules in the future, which is a reasonable request, but it refuses to even do that.

I've offered this user a second chance several times, but every time I extend an olive branch, it swats my hand away. Apparently, it doesn't want to resolve this, it looks like it just wants a target to be angry at because hey, everyone loves a good witch-hunt, right?

So when OP cools off, and after I've had some sleep, then I'll try messaging them again and see if we can sort this out peacefully.

But until then, we're not going to sit around and wait on someone who has insulted our community, lied about our mods, lied to our community members, successfully created a witch hunt on two separate communities, gone out of their way to hurt other people, broken the rules of three different subreddits, and broken the site wide rules.

We would *never* ban someone over their pronouns. That is utterly ridiculous. But we *do* ban people who are disrespectful, antagonistic, and who break the rules.

I don't want to have to bother the admins about this, because I know *exactly* what they will do if I do, and that won't really help anyone. But if folks keep attacking our community, messaging our modmail, sending nastygrams to our mods, and continuing to propagate this witch hunt, then I will have to get the admins involved.

I also use ‘they’ as a secondary choice because it’s hard enough telling people I’m non-binary and want them to use neutral pronouns without having to give a grammar/vocab lesson and explain a set of neopronouns they’ve never heard of.

I think a couple years ago I was more uncomfortable with the idea of being an ‘it’, but nowadays as long as it was coming from a place of someone recognizing my gender and respecting that I’m not a he or she, I’d be ok. I think I would be really upset if someone used ‘it’ in a negative way, but that could happen no matter what pronouns I use and the kind of person willing to demean me like that over gender isn’t going to be respectful whatever I say.
That's a valid point too. 

My language (Norwegian) hasn't had an equivalent for a long time. There's one that's now starting to be used, but it's rare to see, and the time I used it in a text, it was labeled a typo... 

Most people use ""he"" for unknown gender for some reason, along with ""it"" (but ""he"" is still more common) 
>""It / its / itself"" is only for non-living objects, right?  
>  
>Not necessarily.  Most animals are referred to as ""it"" in every day speech - even animals that are sentient, self-aware, and can even communicate (such as parrots or monkeys).  Plants are also referred to as ""it"", even though they are alive.  Furthermore, in ancient texts such as the Bible, angels, demons, and talking animals (such as The Four Living Creatures) are also often referred to as ""it"", despite being unquestionably alive and sentient.

We do not go ahead and check the animals gender to have a conversation about IT
I think it's definitely the jerk-reaction of those specific pronouns, I think.  It makes sense because when you view something as an insult, you'll still get that ""flinch"" moment when someone says it, even if everyone's okay with it.  Just the culture, I think!
This is the original post, I had just copied / pasted it across two different subs.  Unless you mean you can't see this post's contents?
she/her includes a possessive form too, since ""her"" has 2 meanings

some people write all 3 ""they/them/their(s),"" etc., but more often than not it's just shortened to they/them, she/her, he/him

since ""it"" would be the same thing for the first 2, i think they just skip to the possessive form when listing the pronoun since ""it/it"" would be redundant and pointless in comparison to putting its

^(not commenting in support of ""it"" pronouns, but i stumbled upon this post and just wanted to respond to this comment since nobody else has lol)
I'm definitely not saying that ""they"" is wrong to use at all - I just personally don't prefer them for the reasons I wrote above.  Those are just my personal perceptions of the word when it's used to refer to me.
I'm just here to say that OP is not the first nb person I've talked to who uses ""it"" pronouns - it's rare but not unheard of, and isn't just trolling.

Fair enough, I can see that argument! I do feel like it's still using a bit of a different working definition for the pronoun to most people though, so it is sort of asking them to redefine the word. I just associate 'it' so much with non-thinking, non-feeling things. Biblical references to angels don't feel super relevant to daily usage (and indeed sound like a literary effect to say they are beyond human comprehension). I guess we do use it for babies too, but usually when they're still at a point where they lack identity. 

I'm curious, does anyone use 'it' pronouns for you IRL? Not to suggest that affects legitimacy either way of course, I'm just wondering what your experiences are like getting other people to actually use them. 
> Ultimately, I think it’s a bit strange that someone would be hurt or offended by someone calling themself something.

I wanted to sit with this for a second because it’s actually a pretty common thing in my own experience as someone with a learning disorder as well as in the mental illness community. It is actually very hurtful to hear someone using language like “oh I’m so bipolar,” “oops I’m retarded” etc. The difference to me is that the usage that is offensive is clearly glib and insincere. It seems clear from the interactions in this thread that you’re running into problems with people assuming that your usage is one of these insincere ones, but I don’t see any reason to doubt your sincerity personally. It sucks that the climate for these conversations is so volatile and vulnerable now that having unusual pronouns gets you pumped in with the “attack helicopter” crowd.
Yeah, I definitely think that's it. It's like when people reclaim slurs. If I hear them I get alarm bells, but then it's like ""oh wait no he's allowed to say it"" lol
yeah, i can see the title, but the actual post just says \[removed\].

Wow. OP, your anger is totally justified. And the mods calling your behavior problematic just seems like gaslighting to me. Anyone would feel hurt and upset to get a post about their pronouns removed in an nb sub, it's invalidating, and there's nothing at all wrong with letting other nb subs know. It's not ""stirring the pot,"" this is absolutely ridiculous. Seems like a toxic community to me too.
I went to go find the messages you sent our modmail. Your messages are both accusatory and insulting. You have *repeatedly* insulted our community and our modteam, even while I've been spending my time, trying to help you, and you only sought my help *after* you had already gone to two other communities to try and stir up a witch-hunt against our sub and our mods.

I've asked you directly if you would agree to adhere to our rules in the future so I can unban you, and you refused, preferring instead to continue to insult me and our community.

So on my end, I'm trying to help you, you refuse to be helped, have refused multiple times to even agree to follow our rules, keep right on insulting our community, and seem happy to keep right on causing trouble.

Ah, yes, that makes sense - I also get irritated when people say things like that.  I think the main difference is that those kinds of people are using it as a description - they think ""bipolar"" is just ""moody"", ""depressed"" is ""sad"", ""OCD"" is ""kinda neurotic sometimes"", etc. and use it as a description for their behavior or mood at the time.

However, someone who calls themself something as a form of identity is different, I think.  You can't really self-identify into a mental disorder, but you can see this sometimes within the trans and NB community, where sometimes an NB person will identify as trans, and sometimes they won't.  However, if a person who was cis said ""I'm acting so trans right now"" when they wore gender non-conforming clothes, that'd be offensive because they're using it as a descriptor rather than an identity.
That's too bad!  I sent the mods a PM.  Meanwhile, [here is a Google Document of it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nen90xySORr-n8Tx5oOmOS7g2xHz9j-5yKsMAarBHZg/edit?usp=sharing).

You keep characterizing OP's venting as attacks... I just don't see it that way and it's clear that several others don't either. Why does OP need to agree to anything? What rules did OP's original post break? From what I can see, your mod team was 100% in the wrong for removing the original post and OP was completely justified in being upset about it. Your mod team did something extremely invalidating then muted and banned OP for responding with valid anger, called it a troll, and are now demanding some measure of civility from it when it did nothing wrong with it's original post. I hope you can see how hurtful this is. This whole ""I can't help it if it won't help me"" thing is extremely manipulative. You should apologize and unban OP without any conditions, full stop.

Thanks for explaining so much! I think they'll still sound strange to me unless I hear them more commonly used this way (heck, so did 'they' for a while, and I use that myself now) but if I'll definitely understand things more if I meet anyone else who uses the same pronouns. Good luck! 
I think the equivalent — and what people are thinking of when they accuse you of trolling — are the cis people who make jokes like “did you just assume my gender?” or “I identify as [whatever].” Which is clearly not what you’re doing. 
thanks!

Yeah this honestly has me shaking with anger. I'm really sorry you're going through this. Being tone-policed, called a troll, and muted by someone who you're trying to call out for invalidating behavior is SO hurtful. Like, they said they ""suspected you were an elaborate troll"" for using it pronouns? That's just fucked. I myself thought about using it pronouns for a good while but now mostly just use my name. Again I am SO sorry you are going through this. You, your pronouns, and your anger are all 100% valid.
You messaged me directly, wanting me to go review your case and lift your ban. Okay, I go to do that. I find you've spent several hours prior to your appeal lying about our subreddit and our modteam.

You were never banned because of your pronouns, you were banned because your post got pulled and you were disrespectful about it in modmail.

You looked like a troll, you acted like a troll, and you were treated as one, and then you went and lied about our community and tried to get a witch-hunt going over here.

You have insulted me to my face, you have insulted and lied about a community I care about, and despite that, I've offered to lift your ban on two conditions: one, you agree to follow our rules in the future, and two, stop attacking our community.

You refuse to do either. So tell me, if you were in my position, how would you respond to someone who actively attacks your community and refuses to stop doing so?
Ah, yeah, I can see that.  Unfortunate, but what can you do.

You made a post that looked like a troll post. You got banned for it. The *very first message* you sent our modmail, you called our subreddit 'discriminatory.'

So you were already on the attack.

Our mod explained why you were banned. You doubled down and were disrespectful to our mod, so she muted you.

You then went to two other subreddits to complain and make a witch hunt, leaving them up for several hours before messaging me to check things out for you.

I went to go try to help you. I have offered to review this, you've lied about me and you've insulted me directly. You've attacked and lied about /r/genderqueer and our modteam.

I've offered to lift your ban and I've offered to chalk this up to miscommunication if you would simply agree to follow our rules in the future and stop attacking our community, and you have refused to do either.

Instead, you continue to lie about us, continue to assert that we banned you over your pronouns, which is utterly ridiculous, and you keep replying to my comments despite refusing my help.

So, again, here's the offer: You quit attacking our community, you pull the attack posts to end this witch-hunt you've started, and you agree to follow our subreddit's rules when you're on it in the future, and I'll go lift your ban.

If this can't be resolved peacefully and constructively, then I'll go take this to the admins and let them sort it out.

>I'm trying to encourage folks to listen to me and understand what happened and why.

Why won't you listen to anyone else? This is just sad at this point. Your mod team harmed OP initially and should be apologizing. OP didn't respond like a troll, OP responded like someone who is hurt and pissed off which was valid due to the circumstances. Your ""extending an olive branch"" etc is just such obvious fake empathy and super manipulative. This is just sad at this point. I'm done.

Edit: Please just read up on [tone policing](https://everydayfeminism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tone-policing1.png) before you hurt someone else.

I am not a failed child just because I'm not cis	"I recently came out to my mother, and in our conversation she said some very hurtful and ignorant things to me so I just want to post some positive affirmation here for my own mental health and to hopefully let someone else feel better knowing they're not alone.
My identity is not a trend or a phase, I didn't get influenced by the people around me to identify as I do, I never felt fully like a man and I don't feel fully like a woman. My identity is fully my own and I don't identify this way because of some failure on my parent's part, or because I was never a super masculine person, it's how I choose to express myself and what makes me feel comfortable with myself. Its not because I'm ""easily influenced"" and when I do finally start my HRT I will start feeling more like the person I want to be, mood swings and other side effects be damned. I am who I am and I didn't come out for your advise, I came out because I'm tired of hiding who I am for your comfort."	"For sure. Being nonbinary doesn't mean being ""easily influenced."" I grew up in the 00s surrounded by homophobic classmates and knew I was nonbinary, so that argument doesn't fly. 

I'm sorry you didn't get the support you were hoping for from your mother.
I wonder if the ""trend"" argument is the hardest, because you know what, if ""non binary"" had been a phrase in common use in 1983, I would have had a lot less stress and anxiety, I probably wouldn't have been assaulted by a nasty old man in a toilet, and I'd have actually known who I am maybe 40 years earlier.

Grrrrrr.
I’ll tell you my favorite analogy for when people say “it’s just a phase” or a “trend.” 

Being trans can be like being the moon. The moon goes through phases, but no one ever says “oh, it’s just a phase, the moon isn’t really full, look there it’s waning again.” Because behind whether it glows or not, we know it’s always the moon. So whether you knew it or not, you have always been trans. Whether you shine with your truth for the world to see, or if you keep it to yourself like the shadow-hidden moon, you’re always trans, you’re always the moon. Who cares if you go through phases? You’re you, and you’re allowed to figure yourself out, and if you end up being full or new or waxing or waning or all of them and genderfluid, you’re still you. (And if you end up being a dwarf planet instead of a moon, who the fuck cares?)
Parents can really destroy you like no one else. My mom denies that mental health disorders are real, and my younger brother nearly killed himself in a manic episode because his bipolar disorder went untreated.

I never bothered coming out to my mom. I revisit my AGAB on holidays when I visit her.

Bothered isn’t the right word. I meant I would love to be able to tell my mom my gender identity. But I just can’t bear the thought of her denying my gender. So I play pretend, because I still love my mom but I’m done with her hate.
I got the ""who led you to this conclusion"" argument from my dad when I told him too. Hurtful stuff, I'm me I found me on my own. I think the trend argument is the hardest to talk through because of course there are a lot of people coming to this realization now. Our society suppressed it for a long time. That doesn't make it a fad or short term situation though.
Sorry you didn't get the support you were looking for from family. The LGTBQ community is greatly supportive though, so just remember you're never alone.
Proud of you for continuing to believe in yourself. I never plan to come out to my family because I know how that will go. I live far away from any of them, so I can be myself when I’m home. I have a mother who likes to nitpick and complain about everything. If it’s not about me not wearing enough make-up it’s about my hair, or “why haven’t you shaved your legs?” Or “why aren’t you wearing shorts its 80 degrees!” So I do things to appease…shave, put a little eye makeup on, etc…it just makes for an easier visit. And knowing I have an accepting home and chosen family to go back to afterwards keeps me going.
I didn't even know the word trans yet. I was only 2.
It takes a lot of courage to come out to your parents. I'm sorry your mom wasn't accepting and isn't willing to listen. I didn't even come out to mine because she flipped her shit when she found out my date to prom was gay and tried to prevent me from going. It is sad that some people are so hateful they'd rather lose their own child than try to understand LGBT people.
They're so comfortable with the binary they forget that that sureness is proof that it's not about influence. They can't be ""turned"" the same way you aren't. I hate the trend argument. We live in a colonial world. Nonbinary people have been accepted for so long in many cultures and then we got fucked over and now people think it's a trend. Good on you for refusing to live a lie, I'm sad your mom said all those things. All the best on your HRT journey.
Congrats my friend for taking good and positive steps in the light of a really hard situation. Proud of you!
[deleted]
thanks I appreciate the support, I really think that despite the bigotry i was shown it was important that I come out to her, it just showed me whether she will be a part of my life as I transition
That nasty old man better be in prison
This is a beautiful way of looking at it✨
They can destroy you deeper than they even realize. I’ve never come out as nonbinary to my parents, but I was outed as pan when I was in middle school - I tried to explain it better years later to my mom and she asked if pan meant that I was also into beastiality. I’ve tried to tell her how much that hurt me and destroyed our relationship/my trust in her, but she just says that I’m not forgiving and holding a grudge. It’s like… we can have a decent relationship if we never go near that topic ever again. But I don’t know if I’ll ever really heal from knowing that she even thought that was possible.
a gem that I'll share from my convo with my mom ""You're very impressionable and I feel like thats where you got this from, theres things in your childhood I never told you about because I didn't want them to influence your life."" and that turned out to be that when I was in elementary school my teachers tried tell her they suspected I might be autistic and rather than get me tested my mom decide to never tell me so that I could grow up ""normal""
thanks friend, survivorship bias is definitely on full display with the trend argument
I’m not responsible for her or anyone else’s happiness, the fact that she’s my mother doesn’t excuse her hurting me
Realistically he's long dead, which I'm not sad about. As that kind of thing goes it was very low grade, and I'm not too traumatised by it. I know that people have suffered so much worse, and the statistics of how many women have suffered sexual assault is frightening. If I was a ""real man"" I'd be ashamed of my gender."	xs6qqh	NonBinary	245	0.99	2022-09-30 17:09:05
Hello! Annemarie, she/he/they | journey from shaved head to being comfortable with long hair again (growing up, my hair was down to my butt). Pictures from Oct 2018 to April 2020. I realized I miss doing things with longer hair, and see my non-binary identity with our without the hair. 🥰		"Long hair doesn't make you less enby <3
You look awesome no matter what hairstyle
Even though they all fit you very well
Awesome!! I've been thinking about growing my hair out too, how long would you say it took you to get from picture 2 to 4?? Love the colours btw! 😊
Omg my fucking god ur so cuuuutte!!
Question for hair people: could I use a #4 guard on clippers to get the hair length from the second picture, or would it need to grow out from a shorter length? I bought clippers but haven't worked up the nerve to do anything but have my roommate touch up my neck line.
That's my partner!!!!! 🥰 They're wonderful 😍
Very true!
Aw, thank you I appreciate it!
Thanks!! Picture 2 was taken March 31, 2019 and picture 4 was October 28, 2019. 😊
Aw, thank you!! 🙈
I believe in the second picture my hair was around 1-1.5 in long. I'm not sure if the length of a #4 guard, but if it has the lengths listed, that's about what I'd go for. That picture was taken about 3 months after the last time I shaved my head completely. Currently, I shave my undercut with a 1/4"" clipper guard.

Added it to my Amazon wish list. Ty for the suggestion, I'm excited to buy it! 💜
I am a binary resistor. My resistance is 10kOhm.
it’s my computer for college, thanks!! 💕
oh absolutely, it really shows how arbitrary Western societies version of gender is and how many people have seen gender outside the binary for all of their history!
i am glad!!

it’s at Barnes and noble! 

also a part of it that I really enjoy is how it’s a pick your own ending book, which sounds weird but works really, really well and is a very easy read!
I like it because it doesn’t come from the standpoint of anyone doubting it, it’s just stated as fact. We are real  not some people thing that we are not and here is why we are, i love it! (I don’t know if that made sense)

I had a heated argument with a “friend” over pronouns and I’m extremely upset by some of the things he said	"
*Sorry if this isn’t the right place for this discussion, I just need a safe space to rant/ask for possible advice from people who might have faced something similar*

I was on call today with a friend (a former ex boyfriend) and the topic of pronouns/lgbtq rights came up. 

He said and I quote: 

- He will not “bow down” to anyone’s whims just to address them in the way they want, because this opens the gates to more debates and people abusing their ability to be referred to in a particular way (example below) 

- He will not “allow” anyone  to dictate how he should speak to them or address them when there are “more concerning problems out there”

- He said gender/lgbtq problems are first world issues made up by people who have no real suffering in life and compared it to people dying in Syria, stating that that’s a real life problem and not the pronoun debate, and if I argue otherwise I’m out of touch with reality

- Basically ended up stating that issues like body dysmorphia/gender identity confusion are not worth talking about and should not be paid attention to when there are so many “real” issues out there like poverty, world hunger, war etc.

I was at a loss for words, honestly. I tried arguing back with him but whatever I said was met with dismissal and laughter? His entire demeanour left me shocked - it was so degrading and condescending.

I tried to give him some real life examples of my friends who have faced these issues and how it has affected them but to no avail. He ended the argument by quoting Ben Shapiro to me of all people💀

Guys, I need your help. I was left extremely upset and could not reply back with proper arguments to this hateful tirade. 

How do I deal with and respond back to someone who says things like - “If I allow people to dictate what pronoun I should be calling them, what’s stopping them from coming back the next day and telling me that I should refer to them as handsome/beautiful from now on?”"	"""it's clear that you don't care about trans and non binary people. You have every right to speak how you wish, and I have every right to distance myself from people who are hateful to trans and non binary people like me. Consider our friendship over if you are unwilling to see my humanity.""
If your friend has already decided that being courteous, which costs him literally nothing, is not worth doing because someone somewhere else in the world is living in poverty, then that makes him an asshole. The obvious response was ""great, when do you expect to have poverty, murder and war solved? Because the issues I'm talking about a real, and they're happening now to people I care about. Many of whom *live in poverty.*""
Does this guy also refuse to refer to women as “Mrs.” after they get married, and if they change their last name to their husband’s, does he insist on referring to them by their maiden name? 

Everyone everywhere is constantly dictating how people refer to them through titles and names. Are pronouns really such an unthinkable extension? How would he feel if people insisted on misgendering him? Would he be upset, or would he accept it because he also can’t dictate what other people call him? 

Also, the “but other people have it worse” argument is just inane. Should we stop addressing poverty in a certain country because another country is poorer? Fuck no. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity, and your struggle doesn’t have to be the objective worst in order for you to acknowledge that you deserve better.
The funny thing is that people like this usually say that as if they're too busy worrying about poverty, yet they aren't doing anything about poverty either (and often supporting policy that makes it worse, actually) It's a false dichotomy that people use to try and make an excuse for being an ass.

Truth is, people are capable of caring about the many existential problems that we as a species face, while also caring about being decent to people. But your friend sounds like they hold that particular conservative belief and conservative beliefs are generally emotion-based (anger and fear). So I doubt you'd be able to reason with him because that's not the part of his brain he used to get where he is.
Man's over there claiming lgbtq is a first-world issue while people in the middle east are in fear of dying for being lgbtq
This guy is basically saying that people shouldn't have boundaries if they are going to be in his life. His argument essentially boils down to you asking him not to use hurtful names and labels, and him saying that's an unreasonable request. Sounds to me like the only way to end this argument is to say ""okay bye"" and never talk to him again because he cares more about his right to say and do harmful things than other people's right to exist in safety.

The fact that people are dying in Syria is not an excuse for him to be unnecessarily cruel.
I'm sorry this happened to you. It must be really upsetting to realize someone who you used to love and trust is such a cruel person.

One thing that can be useful in situations like this is to reframe someone's argument to see if it still hold any water, of if it's just blatant transphobia/homophobia.

Saying he ""will not bow down to how someone wants to be addressed"" is obviously not true, as this is something he does already. This is no different for trans people than cis people. If he met a cis person who said ""Hi my name is Susan"" and he said ""Nah I'm gonna call you Josh"" no one would question that he's just being an asshole for no reason. 

He already calls cis people by their proper names and pronouns, he just has a problem with doing it for trans people, which makes him a transphobic asshole.

Also, saying ""if I have to use someone's chosen pronoun"" (which again he already does for cis people with no problem) then ""what's to stop someone from saying that I have to call them handsome"" is a slippery slope argument, which is a logical fallacy.

There being ""more pressing problems"" to deal with is also not a good argument. Treating queer and trans people with basic respect and decency is not mutually exclusive with ""solving the world's problems."" No one says we should stop one kind of cancer research because there is another kind that is more severe or widespread. Also, what is this guy doing to solve the world's problems? Probably nothing.

Ben Shapiro is a hack and a troll. He makes his money by making pithy but unsound arguments that collapse under any inspection, and only persuades people who lack critical thinking skills. He's an idiot's idea of a smart person. Whenever someone quotes Ben Shapiro to you, all they are telling you is that they are a moron who has been fooled by a grifter.

Unfortunately this is not an argument you can win with your ex. He is not approaching the conversation in good faith, and is not interested in hearing an alternate viewpoint. He is interested in being condescending and smugly superior and ""owning libs.""

The best thing for you to do here is to not interact with this person anymore. He has shown you his true colors, and is not worth keeping in your life. You can grieve for what you once had, but there is nothing to be gained by trying to discuss this further with him.
I'm sorry your ex is so awful. Personally I wouldn't talk to a person like that ever again
Honestly, he sounds like he listens to Jordan Peterson or Ben Shapiro or both. That sound be an automatic no from any trans/nonbinary person.
>I tried arguing back with him but whatever I said was met with dismissal and laughter

I don't believe he actually care about ""real world"" problems if that's his behavior. I think you should cut contact with him
If I allow x then what's to stop y. This is a straight up  slippery slope fallacy. (False argument). Honestly calling them a girl as a pejorative (demeaning to them and women) will make them mad but I don't think they will take it to heart and realize why they are being an ass hat. It's hard to face people like this. You may choose to limit contact or bully them right back. It's up to you. Killing it with kindness or ignoring their willful blindness is also an option. Unfortunately it's up to them to change their mind.
Ima leave you a quote beautiful human ""Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past."" 

It's basically psychological warfare.  Also reminds me of that Atlantic article from the early days of the Trump presidency and this bizarre anti-reality movement within the Republican party:  [""The Cruelty is the Point.""](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/)   

They relish in being contrarian, not because the opinion is important to *them,* but because it's important to *you*.  For example, they don't give a flying fuck if the earth is flat or round, they just know that *you* know the earth is round, and they hate you.
It sounds like he’s been listening to Jordan Peterson quite a bit given that he’s using all of his talking points. There’s a few different ways of handling this, but here’s how I would handle it, assuming he’s someone I cared about:

It sounds childish, and honestly it kind of is—but I would start calling him by a name that’s completely not his own. And make it a bad name, too. Maybe a woman’s name. Something you know he’d hate. And LAUGH if he seems the mildest bit annoyed by it.

If he asks you not to use it, just use his own logic against him. I believe in free speech, there are bigger issues in the world that what he wants to be called, I don’t let other people dictate my behavior, etc. 

But the key here is to not be tooo aggressive and try and keep it playful and light hearted if at all possible.

If you can get him to see how it’s the exact same thing and how childish it is, he just might be able to come around. And it’s so much better than having an argument or a philosophical debate with someone deep in the Jordan Peterson sphere of bullshit.

Remember, these people are not necessarily bad people, they’ve just been indoctrinated into a really reductionistic and harmful perspective. It’s not our responsibility to help them out of it, but leaving them to fester in that helps nobody, least of which you.
What kind of argument is that last quote lmao. Honestly not a friend of yours and not worth your time. Ik its hard to hear, esp if you were friends for a while, but the pain of ripping the band aid will heal and your life will be improved.         
         
Nothing you will ever say or do will help that person. They’re too far pilled and will have to pull themselves out in their own. This is very hard and very rare for people to do. Chances are better the younger they are, but dont wait for it to happen. It likely won’t.           
It doesnt need to be a dramatic “im never speaking to you again” announcement. You can just drop it and leave him cold turkey style. If you have to say anything, say you cant respect people with views that are so harmful to others. **5 people literally were just murdered due to anti-lgbt rhetoric from people like Ben Shapiro.** Tell him you dont stand for that behavior. Then just drop it. If he tries fighting you just walk away. He is a hot potato. Drop it and do nothing more.
Damn. Wonder how he has all this time to argue when he’s so preoccupied with “real issues.” You’d think that would be all he’s doing, instead of worrying about “fake issues” like uhhh…. being asked to be decent to others
Honestly, put the entire friend in the bin. He doesn't want to actually learn. He is here to be a dick and you will never teach him how to be a decent person because *he is not open to learning*. Bin 'em and find better friends.
Dude thinks his control over others is more fundamental and important than their own autonomy and self-determination. I would stay away from this person. People who think this way don’t merely not respect pronouns. They end up being coercive and boundary violating in other ways too. Because they don’t understand that other people are all the way other people. He thinks that respecting someone’s boundaries is him “bowing down” because he doesn’t like any limitations on his behavior, even if they are healthy. 

Also, ask him to look up stories of LGBTQ folks and what they go through in refugee camps. Queer people don’t just exist in the first world, and some of the people “dying in Syria” are queer. 

I’m sorry you had someone be so disgustingly hateful to you who was once close to you. I hope you start feeling better.
How do you deal with/talk to them?

You don't. Don't JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain) with people like this, let them learn that the consequences for bigotry and phobia are being cut off. Don't engage, don't try to convince. Because you're just giving up your energy to someone who doesn't deserve it and is unlikely to change their mind anyway.
>How do I deal with \[transphobic assholes\]?

Edit mine.

You don't. You cut him off. Sounds like there's a reason he's an ex boyfriend, and twenty thousand reasons he should be an ex friend.
Sounds like he's a LogicBro type, so here are a couple lines of questioning you could follow (well, if you're committed to talking more about it and not just distancing yourself from him lol).

\- Ask how he thinks progress is made in society/humanity more generally. What should we strive for out of humanity? What role do things like art, philosophy, and self actualization play? 

\- Going off that, what makes a ""first world society""? If poverty, disease, etc vanished overnight worldwide, would that mean humanity would inherently stop progressing in any way? You know, now that 'real life problems' had been taken care of. 

\- Are we only defined by our problems? Or can we strive for more - i.e. scientific & cultural progress, human flourishing, etc). If these are purely ""first world issues"" (lol), why wouldn't that simply suggest that more diversity in self-expression might be a natural next step?

It sounds like his, and other LogicBros', problem is having a shallow & unexamined concept of what life should really be about. It ain't just efficiency and profit maximization or whatever.
It's Not ""Letting People Dictate What You Call Them"", It's Just Respect. You Wouldn't Call Someone You Like A F***ing A**hole, Would You? So How Is This Really That Different? (I Mean Maybe Not The Best Example, Because You Still Shouldn't Misgender People You Don't Like, But It's The Best I Could Come Up With.)

Also Yeah, Maybe We're Not Suffering As Much As People Dying In Wars, Doesn't Mean We're Not Suffering, Different People Can Suffer At The Same Time. I'm Sure If He Got Fired From His Job For No Apparent Reason, He'd Try To Fight It, Or Get Another Job, Why? Oh He Doesn't Have A Job? ""What A First World Problem, There Are People Dying Around The World, Children Dying, And You Expect Me To Care That You Just Don't Have A Job?"" See How Stupid That Sounds? Basically The Same Argument He's Making, Perhaps You'd Be Able To Explain That To Him.
You want to know a ""real issue"". The unpoportunate amount of lgbTQ people  taking their lives because they don't feel accepted. He can suck a fat one, he's a dying breed.
You don't. He's right that no one can force him to respect them. That said he can't force you or anyone else to deal with his transphobia and exorsexism so don't. If you have the means cut him out of your life. There are people who will respect you and be opening to learning and growing with you. You have a finite amount of energy and time, friend, don't waste it on a bigoted cis man. Your friendship and you are worth more than this. He doesn't deserve you or the emotional dehumanising labor he's trying to put you through to justify your existence. You don't deserve that. Reclaim your time. Save your energy for yourself and those that respect and love you.
There’s no winning against that. They’d no longer be my friend.
Bruh it doesn't matter if someone is drowning in a puddle or the ocean we should help them even if you consider this a first world problem, also start calling him something mean,and dont back down because He cant be angry abt it lol
I always hate the argument ""there are bigger problems I'm the world"" like what are we supposed to let people starve because of a war going on. Are we supposed to drop anything we're doing for global warming. No humanity is large multiple issues can be dealt with at a time. The fuck are they doing to help people overseas. It's just a simple way of saying ""I don't care about it so why would I help"" and it's a dick mentality.
I mean, I'm an enby who grew up in poverty. I think that kinda proves gender identity isn't just a privileged person problem. Does he think that every trans person had an easy life? 
I'd definitely start phasing him out my life if I were you and if he starts to question it just say that your world views collide too much and being around isn't fun for you
In my experience there is no use arguing with people like that. He obviously found it funny that we suffer and no amount of facts or evidence will change his mind. Now it's just up to you. Do you continue a friendship like that or do you cut it off?
Do we have the same ex? Lol
I would definitely cut ties with this person, but I would also block them on any social media you have them on and make sure you keep a record of them. I had to cut someone out of my life many years ago for racist, homophonic and transphobic rhetoric they kept spouting. At the behest of a family friend who was an attorney, I kept copies of some messages and I also kept the persons phone number and full name. I kept all of this in a file in my desk, just in case. Unfortunately with this kind of attitude we need to be really safe, especially when it's someone whose known us closer and been within our immediate circle and knows more about us. This kind of thinking quickly lends itself to some scary situations and people, and I implore you take extra steps in safety. Even if they seem paranoid. Gotta keep yourself, and your community, safe.
Yikes that sucks I'm sorry you've had to deal with that shit head. He's intentionally blowing this way out of proportion to make you feel bad which is also know as gasslighting. He clearly doesn't believe in trans validity nor trans rights. Was he like this at all in the relationship? He's not worth your time and energy just drop him from your life.
As the old Scottish idiom goes:

“Get him tae fuck”
Honestly, no response is the best response with people like this. He's told you where he stands and that he won't be supportive. So let him stand there alone.

If after what just happened in Colorado isn't enough for him to realize the threat to the LGBTQ+ community is still very real, he's not interested in doing better and is really just trying to get you to validate his bigotry. He's also playing with you and clearly enjoys getting a rise out of you. 

You deserve better friends than that.
Cut him out of your life.

End of.
I'm pretty sure the ""some people have it worse"" argument is a logical fallacy. If he were to use that perspective consistently, and not to support his own bigotry, the only issue he could care about is the single most dire issue in the world. How could he objectively detect the largest issue in the world? 

I don't think he could because human suffering is complex, often hidden, and highly subjective. So instead of trying to triage which issues to care about or dismiss, he should at the bare minimum be able to sympathize with other humans. This is literally free, you don't need to do anything other than say ""I may not understand your suffering, but pain is pain, and I hope you can find peace"".

Also it sounds like this person wasn't engaging in good faith. This isn't someone worth talking to or keeping in your life. If they listened and respected you that would be one thing, but laughter and dismissal is a clear sign that they think less of you (maybe they have thought that way all along).
By his own logic, every problem or challenge  he faces is also a first world problem and not worthy of attention or effort.

Personally I would probably just cut him off.  But if you want you could explain this instead:  Every problem anyone has can always be dismissed if the existence of bigger problems is all it takes.  Or you could take the petty approach and just start dismissing every concern he has.

Doesn't like his asshole boss?  First world problem, get over it. Hungry people exist.

Elbow sprain making it painful to work? So what dude. Ignore it and solve poverty instead.

Broken heart from a break-up? Fuck your feelings, there's global warming to deal with.

Your mom's sick in the hospital? Whatever.
Think about the poor Ukrainians who have lost their entire family

Etc etc.
Here’s how you respond with someone at Ben Shapiro level dipshittery. “If someone says their name is Handsome then that’s what I’m going to call them because I’m not an asshole. See how easy that is?”

What if someone says they’re a cat? Well they probably don’t literally mean they believe themselves to physically belong to a species among the genus feline. They are either pretending or a furry or something else that’s probably not harmful so maybe this one also shouldn’t bother you? 

I don’t know how to tell someone that yes, it is actually incumbent upon you to treat other people with decency and respect if they don’t already believe it. If you choose not to, you are always the problem and no one else.
>“If I allow people to dictate what pronoun I should be calling them, what’s stopping them from coming back the next day and telling me that I should refer to them as handsome/beautiful from now on?”

Does he currently walk around actively telling people that theyre ugly unprompted?
""You have every right to be wrong. Just like I have every right to ignore every thing you just said.""
Ive worked with fundraising in an organisation that is helping dying people in Syria. In our organisation we still respected echothers pronouns. By respecting eachother and making sure everyone felt good, we could do our work better, and get more donations to the dying people in Syria.
I don't know how attached you are to this person, but they sound toxic af.

I'd say cut them out, they ain't going to be bringing any joy or fulfillment into your life disregarding something that is so important to you like that.

But, if you do really want to stay in contact with them. Maybe let them know how much they have hurt you with their disregard. Maybe if you explain the way you view things via text they won't be able to cut you off and laugh, and maybe they will be able to read and sit with the words.

To be honest, I would say a no hoper, though.
What?? It baffles me that people actually think like this. That’s so messed up, I’m so sorry you had to endure that conversation.
First of all tell him that if that's what you want i'll start calling you her/she because now i can call you whatever gender I want correct and there is no real problem correct basically use what he said to your advantage and I think that might work.
I’d just posit with reality:

WE’RE not in that situation. Why is it such an inconvenience for you to use pronouns in the way someone asks you to, the same way someone asks you to call them XYZ name?

Also, LGBTQ issues are NOT limited to the first world, they’re just worse in other countries and the people are far more marginalized. 

we aren’t going out for beers Brad, we aren’t Triage doctors. He’s just being rude about something that would barely inconvenience him. I’d just ask why he’s being so defensive and incurious about gender.
Start calling him something stupid instead of his name and refuse to stop until he either leaves you alone or changes his views
I'm sorry this happened to you. He's not worth the arguing. It's hard to change a self-centered asshole.

He keeps talking about these ""real"" problems. I would be curious to know how much real effort he has put into solving the problems in Syria. If he has actually done a lot, then maybe it's fine. If someone can only focus on one thing their entire life but would really devote their life to it, then it's cool, too.

However, most of the time when someone is really that devoted to solving a specific issue, they wouldn't have the time or energy to go around invalidating other issues. Someone like your ex-friend most likely just doesn't care about other people. They are comfortable with talking about Syria because it sounds far-far-away and he doesn't actually need to do anything to sound supportive. In the meantime, trans people are everywhere and he is asked to do actual things to support them. Now he is feeling uncomfortable and looking for excuses, even though the favor asked is so easy to do.

Also, I'm perfectly fine with calling everybody beautiful because that's what I believe.
I'm not great at this stuff, but I just wanted to say that I'm sorry you had that experience. It sounds like you handled yourself well though in the face of overwhelming dismissal. I hope you're ok and I'm very glad he's ""ex""
I don't argue with people unwilling to listen to me. No friend of mine is going to tell me that they won't address me the way I feel most comfortable. That's super disrespectful and automatically will end any friendship we have. I do try to talk to them before just ending the friendship about how it makes me feel for them not to and if they apologize and actually make an effort to respect my wishes then we are good but if not then I don't want to talk to you ever again. I don't have many friends and the ones I do have are super understand and respectful.
You dont engage with them. They have 0 interest in hearing you out. Just dont interact with people like that.
You should have kept him as an ex, ex partner ,ex friend. You shouldn't keep people like that in your life.
Speaking to you like that, shows he has no respect or consideration for you .
He won't ""bow down"" huh? I'm sorry but I just find it laughable he's acting like using pronouns, an every day occurrence whenever you speak and address people, is some royal treatment- 

It takes zero fucking effort to say ""she"", zero, yet he's resisting and pushing back SO HARD- I just can't fathom that shit. It says a lot about your character you're gonna fuss over how someone's addressed.

If I tell you my name, you don't get to go ""no I'm not following your whims! I'm calling you Jake instead!"" Can he NOT hear himself and how ridiculous that is? How childish that is?

Everyone already broke down why his ""arguments"" are stupid but I wanted to say something too bc WOW, this much ignorance is astounding.

Lgbtq problems aren't important enough? Our community practically gets murdered for existing (hell some shit happened RECENTLY) but oh well I guess death isn't serious enough. If anything he's the one out of touch, he doesn't know first thing about the community's struggles-

If he thinks trans people are privileged in a world that wants us dead I don't know what to tell him.
When someone tells you who they are, believe them. That's first and foremost. This friend told you he doesn't care, so in your shoes I wouldn't waste another breath on em.
It could be that I'm very tired of feeling as though I have to justify my existence, but I'd start using she/her pronouns for him... since ye know, no one should get to 'dictate' how someone else refers to em.
ah yikes, former ex boyfriend. that would sting. don't try to argue with people like this. his mind is made up. you will get hurt engaging with him on this. believe me i've tried. cut people like this out of your life.

>what’s stopping them from coming back the next day and telling me that I should refer to them as handsome/beautiful from now on?

like that would be a bad thing, lol

you know, hearing how strong and demeaing his opinions are, I reckon he is probably non-binary himself and repressing it strongly. I don't think a cis person would think about stuff like this.
There are people dying in other countries but that doesn't make the cost of living crisis in my country or people's inability to heat their homes any less of an issue.  There are lgbt+ people in other countries too, does he think it's solely an affluent Western country thing? Would he hold the same argument about lgbt+ people in Syria, seeing as he's so concerned about Syrians?

Respecting someone's identity isn't also a grand heroic effort to do. The struggles of other people don't stop you from referring to someone correctly, you don't take the food out of an orphan's mouth if you respect someone's pronouns.

Being handsome or beautiful isn't someone's identity, it's a subjective descriptor. If he's quoting Ben Shapiro at you to defend things like this, you probably don't want someone like that in your life. He sounds exhausting to be around and needing to justify your identity to a friend isn't the way to live.

Guarantee he'd have something to say if you referred to him as she/a woman also (don't misgender him by doing this), it's not about him havign issue with 'being told to do things' it's about him justifying why he's a bigot.

(I'm sure he's doing SO MUCH charity work if he's so concerned about these things too, or is it all something he weaponises to not respect people's identities?)
The whole ""starving children in Africa"" argument has always been fucking stupid and IMO, pretty racist, because it's just the speaker deliberately picking somewhere they have no knowledge of and flattening their entire culture into ""people in the poor country who's existence is suffering."" Like, do you know any Syrians? Have you asked them about their culture, their way of life? Why aren't you helping them if you're so single-minded about this issue to the point where nothing else is as important?  


It's bad-faithed. They don't care about Syrians and they don't care about human suffering. They just don't want to have specific concerns in their life and are trying to take shortcuts to keep their world small. I know you're upset, and likely pretty angry, but when someone argues a serious issue like that in bad faith, using fallacies and mocking your viewpoint, they're beyond reproach. They're taking your feelings and turning them into a playground.  It's disgusting and so painful when it happens.   


I used to spend hours thinking of ways to verbally disassemble people like this before removing them from my life, but when you give someone the opportunity to talk, you give them control, and validate their shitty behavior as being worth tolerating. The validity of queer issues is not up for debate, and when you give people the chance to debate, it validifies their hateful POV. You gain nothing from speaking to this person any further, or elaborating on why you've stopped speaking to them. It probably won't change their mind, but it's SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL than any arguments one can come up with.  


I'm so sorry you had to go through that conversation, and even if you don't want to take my advice I recommend at least creating some space between you two where you can have time to confide in other peeps about it and just not talk to this friend for a bit.
Sometimes it’s better to just not associate with those types of people. You could argue until your face turns blue but they refuse to acknowledge any of your points.
That argument really gets me. We can’t try and improve the lives of everyone? Yes world hunger is a big issue but why does the rest of humanity need to be the cost. I personally can focus on both why sacrifice something?
I don't see how someone can be your friend and not your ally. 

Not too long ago I had a similar exchange with someone I'm acquainted with who recommended Abigail Shrier to me because apparently I should do more research. It left me floored. Kind of hurt. I thought about it and finally responded,

""I do not have the time or the crayons"" and blocked their ass.
Then he should clearly stop whining about this cuz there are worse things in the world. He needs to stop wasting time dictating what pronouns other people are allowed to have and get back to fixing world hunger. Why even bring up his first world problems at a time like this
Debates with people like that aren't worth it. If he refuses to respect your pronouns and gender identity, he's not a real friend! Also, invalidating you on the premises of ""other people have it worse"" and ""you could use pronouns to take advantage of how I refer to you"" is super shitty. At this point, his utter lack of respect for you, and his refusal to even attempt to understand what you're dealing with shows that he's not a very empathetic person. At the end of the day, his actions and words speak volumes about him and not about you. Sometimes being friends with an ex is awesome, but sometimes you gotta remember that y'all ain't together for a reason and move on. I know that this doesn't help you with your debate points, but take it from a 28 year old themby: people that don't respect you don't deserve you.
That sounds like a lot of effort just to not change a few letters he says. Imagine wasting all this effort when he could be saving lives in Syria...
Your ""friend"" sounds like he is trying to find ways to justify his response to a topic that makes him uncomfortable. It's easier to blame others than take a hard look at himself.

You probably can't change his mind, but if you think you can get through, you might want to bring attention to the horrifying rates of suicide and self-harm that trans and nonbinary people face, the disproportionate amounts of family rejection and homelessness, the number of hate crimes committed _even in ""first world"" countries_ , and high risk for substance use disorder. If he truly thinks suicide, homelessness, hate crimes, and drug use are all ""first world problems,"" there is absolutely no point in discussing it.

Also, since when are trans rights and refugee rights mutually exclusive? It's not like you can only care about one or the other.
Go no contact. That’s not someone that values you or your safety.
i actually used this almost verbatim to deal with a transphobe. i just blocked her after on everything and she ended up messaging me and infantilizing me saying, “honey, i knew this would happen, here’s what i meant”. didn’t read it, just blocked. people like this aren’t worth engaging after you tell them it’s over!!
I am saving this for later. I feel like my aunt or cousin will say something cause they already made it clear how they view trans people. Especially trans parents like myself. But I'm different cause I'm family. Yeah no I'm different cause you still see me as female.
Exactly
I did tell him that can’t compare these two very different kinds of sufferings and just because someone has it worse doesn’t mean someone else’s pain is automatically invalidated.

His response was to basically call me delusional and out of touch for supporting things that “are an invention of the privileged first world people who haven’t seen real suffering in their lives” and that to him, the pronoun debate is a non issue because others have it sooooo much more worse and that “people are literally dying out there”. 

I was genuinely not expecting this level of vitriol from him and ended the call extremely upset. How do you even begin explaining things to someone like this who is so SO adamant and dismissive?
\^ this ten brajillion percent!

There are always bigger fish to fry, but it's not a zero-sum game and we can fry several at once,,, and the people who make noises about big fish turn out to not be frying anything.
and far too many countries in Africa.
Ben shapiro publicly declared multiple times that he’s never sexually satisfied his wife, while telling us all about her boyfriend from work who actually makes her laugh. 

I cannot imagine how anyone takes him seriously.
to call attention to a problem cause the problem is more useful to you than the solution. and the helps you call attention to yourself.
Why does he think all trans and non-binary people are rich white kids from first-world countries? The vast majority of us *aren’t*. His ignorance is astounding, honestly, and at some point I would evaluate whether having these conversations with him is productive and whether you’re making headway, or whether they’re just a waste of your energy.
You give them one more chance not to be an asshole then you cut them out of your life if possible
> to him, the pronoun debate is a non issue

Great, sounds like it shouldn't be an issue for him to use the pronouns you asked him to use. That's how it's worked for me so far with people to whom the pronoun debate is a non issue.

How much do you think this fucker is doing to help the people who are ""literally dying out there""? How much of the energy he spent being a vitriolic shitbag to you could have been spent solving the real problems he thinks are more important, if he were actually concerned with them? My impression is that people who talk this kind of talk can almost never back it up. (And people who *can* back it up almost never talk this kind of talk.)

I'm not suggesting you bring that up in a debate, I'm suggesting you write his justifications off as reactionary bullshit, because the real thing his responses are rooted in is a feeling of not being in control when he wants to be in control, not any of the pseudomoralistic ""there are worse problems"" excuses he's throwing out there. Of course he'd never admit it. *Maybe* that's because he doesn't even know this about himself. More likely that's because admitting it would mean losing control when he wants to be in control.

Past a certain point, trying to ""reply back with proper arguments"" to this kind of person on these kinds of terms is just playing along with a game that they never took seriously in the first place.
I’m curious about his opinion on trans and non binary people who live in less developed countries with oppressive laws or cultures that show a lot of hostility towards LGBT people - what about their suffering? In fact there is still transphobic violence and murders happening in countries like the USA, people are indeed suffering and dying
If that's the way he feels then you can't really do anything about it. Either way, he gonna wanna change that mentality before he's an old man, yelling on a park bench about things he's too stupid to comprehend. And that's on him, you can't fix stupid.
A great deal of white supremacy's work was to *erase* alternate gender identities. Many, many non-white cultures actually supported and embraced nonbinary identities before white supremacy rolled in. Your friend is a testicle incarnate.
""There are so many REAL problems, like war and poverty!"" 

Same guy probably: ""You want money to feed your family? Get a real job and quit being worthless!""

""China's trying to stand up to us?? I say we show 'em who's boss!!""
Yeah, it's all about control. He clearly holds you in contempt and does not care about you (or really, anyone else) at all. I highly doubt he gives a shit about the people dying in other countries either. He's just being a sorry excuse for a human being. This is not someone you want to spend your time around, OP. I know it's hard to feel like you have the ""right"" to ditch a friendship over a ""disagreement"" about these issues, but you absolutely do and don't let him or anyone else tell you otherwise. A true friend, even if they disagree with you (which on this issue is pretty problematic as it is) will still refer to you how you want to be referred to and will have these discussions with you humbly, actually wanting to understand. This guy isn't worth your gentleness. Fuck him."	z2uu62	NonBinary	236	0.98	2022-11-23 17:19:41
I got a hoodie from the men's section that made me feel euphoric af (not wearing a binder cuz I never felt the need to... also I seriously don't need one; my chest size used to be be an insecurity, but ever since I embraced my agender identity, it kinda all makes sense now?)		"Nice. I feel you about the chest area. I used to have major insecurities about being a AA cup. Now I embrace it and feel grateful I don't have dysphoria about my chest. I look fairly androgynous and I'm digging it.
Looks good on you. 👍🙂
You're rocking it!
So much SAME! I have always dipped into the men's section. They have the best hoodies, flannels or really anything with long sleeves. I have an athletic build (aka small chest thick everywhere else). When I was younger I hated my body. I am lanky and oddly shaped. Now I am grateful. I have non threatening boobies, that are actually great, and I'm not a rail which makes it easier to twerk my problems away. Embrace your goods!! 

Great hoodie choice too BTW!
The men's section has amazing clothes! Sadly, I can't look fairly androgynous since I have c cups, which means the shirts I get have to be really baggy.
This was taken right after I had woken up lmao I look so out of it
asdfghj you look so cool I wish I looked like that ;-;
I have the same kind of experience with my lack of facial hair. All my Guy friends can grow beards but I never could. At first I felt bad about it bit now it feels like a blessing. Also, you look great in that sweater!
Exactly, mood!!
Thanks!! 💖
Thank you 😊
Exactly!!!  Boobs always get in the way of things, why did we ever think we'd be better off with them?? Hell nah, and thanks heh
Baggy clothes are the most comfy though 💖
You look great!
Omg thank you ahh I struggle a lot with my body image though so I'd argue that you really don't but thank you so much, you made my day 🥰
That's valid and thank you!
Agreed. So much space- and they're warm!
Aw thank you 🥰"	k7ocjh	NonBinary	236	0.99	2020-12-06 06:11:25
My gender identity is a mix of these two toys I bought.		"I have an irresistable urge to have skeletor riding that unicorn, just sayin
Ah, your gender identity is the mid-80s? I can relate, TBH! 😂
I relate to this waaaay too much
Same.
I had a dream around new years involving gender represented as action figures which were gifted to me!

I was upset because someone who looked like a duck took the first action figure I unwrapped and suddenly dressed in the clothes which is a style I have been wanting for years.

I was left with a He-Man action figure. I never liked He-Man, he represented toxic masculinity and a friend in hs would mock He-man. It felt like the masculine image I had for myself was taken away, and I was stuck with He-Man.

Funny because irl, I've been dealing with someone who keeps misgendering me and putting me in situations which by even telling people about make them view me as feminine because they're stories associated with female victimhood. Even for what they've put me through for almost a decade is basically one long-*ss story of femake victimhood.

It's like the only way I can be perceived as masculine is if I dive into toxic masculinity versus how I viewed myself (Oh, they did give me my username. I couldn't come up with something better and I liked the shock value where I was initially using it.).

Also, with the clothes taking, the same real-life person tries to take the things I am doing and putting them on like it's part of their identity, and then puts me down and acts like I don't know anything whenever I try to correct him.
Put them together and make Skelecorn.
The centaur potential...
LOL. Might be an idea for my next tattoo!

As an AFAB enby, it took me such a long time to allow myself permission to enjoy being Femme!! Yes I wear earrings and glitter and makeup and heels AND I am not a girl 💕 I feel more confident in my gender identity than ever before, because I'm allowing myself to be nothing and everything at once.		"I’ve had a similar journey as an AMAB and allowing myself to appreciate my facial hair. I’m so happy for you that you’re allowing yourself a femme space. 💛💜🖤
I'm certain you look cute no matters how you present💕
I'm also very glad you've gotten more comfortable with yourself!!!
I've had similar struggles too because I'm afab too and constantly misgendered and I feel like letting myself be a bit fem will make that worse but I love wearing makeup so I'm not gonna let that stop me. I'm so glad that you are happy and confident! You look fantastic! Have a fantastic day/night/whatever! 💚
I definitely recognize that struggle from the amab side kf things and struggling with a more ""masculine"" look, it's hard to shake that idea there's still a certain way we have to look to be NB when really it's looking like however you want
Same. I identified as FTM first and felt so boxed. I felt like I had given up restrictions just to gain others. Once I was out as Non binary for a while, it got easier and easier to be femme. Now I’m just a gender clusterfuck
We need to stop gatekeeping between oppressed communities if we wanna get anywhere. As a non-binary human, my relationship to gender is hard and complicated which means that labels are hard and complicated too! I identify as Femme and I also identify as a Twink! In using these terms I am in no way trying to disrespect the communities they originated from, but I am claiming an identity for myself as a queer person who loves women, men, and anyone in between.
I totally get that sentiment. At the end of the day your identity is yours and no one can take that away from you, it's yours to own, create and love. I still can't wear skirts, but am happy playing with makeup and jewellery, and present so femme in general. I like challenging other people's perception of what gender can be and is, and disrupting my own bias to the binary, because just like you I am femme but also not a lady, too! And that's a real kicker for people to understand, but that's Truth isn't it.  Also, you look amazing, and at the end of the day, looking amazing is genderless!
Femme is not synonymous with feminine. Femme is a lesbian specific term.

Thank you so much that's so wonderful to hear from you and I appreciate your words ✨
You're so sweet thank you!!!💕
This. I'd recommend you use the spelling ""fem"".
Actually femme belongs to the French. It's literally French for women, so ask the French before you use it thanks!!

Go read Stone Butch Blues. In the US it has been in use since the 50s as a lesbian identity. I'm a butch lesbian with a femme girlfriend and I find it  concerning that people who are not lesbians are appropriating our term. It has been a lesbian term since the 50s used to describe the experiences of a subculture within a marginalised group.Taking a term from lesbian culture is appropriation, plain and simple. It undervalues lesbian identity and herstory. 

&#x200B;

A femme is a lesbian who subverts femininity, i.e. takes the femininity she has been taught to perform for men and performing it for only herself and other women. If you are not a lesbian you should not use it.

Hey, AMAB non-binary people	I love you and you’re valid and you deserve more support and representation never doubt your identity no matter how you present	"💚

I normally present masculine, so this is really helpful! Thanks!
Hey! Thanks! It's tough sometimes, I hate my body some days, but I'd hate a female one too. I don't want hormones, I can make it by with some makeup and we'll fitted clothes. I'm not androgenous and am figuring this out. But one thing is for sure. I have myself love no matter of it's a dysphoric day or not. No matter the adversity outside home, or even in it some days. But I am still a person. And I'm awesome. 

And so are you.

Weird post but my boyfriend got me boxers I think for a Christmas gift and a binder and my aunt (who hatey identity) thinks it's weird what do u guys think???		"Getting someone something they want as a gift sounds fairly normal to me.
The binder was just a gift it wasn't for any holiday anniversary it was just him knowing I wanted it XD. and she almost broke us up over it..
Your relationship is yours and your partner’s alone, no one can tell you what’s allowed and what’s not, other than the two of you. If he knows you want these things and supports you in your journey, that’s amazing and so so precious. 

Your aunt doesn’t have a saying cause: 1. Not her life 2. Not her partner. I’m assuming you’re young and she takes care of you, even if that’s the case, you are allowed to have boundaries, you don’t have to be a jerk about it, just let her know that it’s ok if she thinks it’s weird, but that’s not the case for you. Thank her for caring but establish the limits that work for you with kindness.

Now, do you think it’s weird?
I think your aunt should mind her own business 🤷
Your boyfriend seems extremely sweet and considerate. He listened to you and got you gifts you wish use and enjoy. Your aunt sounds like she’s making excuses to be transphobic.
WHAT DO *YOU* THINK?! other peoples opinions on YOUR life are NOT *your* business. Everyone is going to have an opinion on anything you say, do, wear, eat, etc.... stop wasting your time. Spend your time living your life and watch them waste theirs worried about what you do. 

Are YOU happy with gifts like that? Thats all that matters.
OP, you sound like you have a keeper on your hands. I understand your aunt may not be supportive, but it sounds like your bf loves you if he is being supportive like that. You deserve love and even if she tries to make you break up with him, lemme tell you from experience, as I was in a similar position at your age: don't. If you do, you will almost certainly regret it. He sounds like he is listening to your needs, and you can't put a price on that.

Just my two cents.
I think that's very cool and thoughtful of him! It's just clothes and hopefully they'll help you feel happier with yourself :D
Sorry if this sounds rude but your aunt really shouldn't be getting much of a say in what gifts you boyfriend gets for you for Christmas
Fuck ya aunt. Ain't none of her goddamn business
no that's sweet as hell if yoi wanted those things
I think thats super sweet!! 👌🏼  They support you which is amazing! If your aunt can't see how much he loves you by supporting you then their opinions don't matter.
Thank you guys so it wasn't weird after all ☺️
Thats so sweet! She probably just doesn't want to think about underwear, her kid, and their boyfriend all together haha, not inherently a sexual gift but if she doesn't get the significance of binder + boxers, someone openly buying their partner underwear could be seen that way
Fuck your aunt.
Your aunt can, just as a suggestion, pound sand?
Kiddo, you’re allowed to accept meaningful gifts from your boyfriend. That’s a private and personal gift relating to your identity. It’s good that you have someone who supports you and loves you for you and wants to reassure you of that. Your aunt is being weird here ok?
Ultimately, you have only one person to answer to in life, and that is to yourself. I finally started living my life the way I want to, whether it be gifts from others, or quite literally who/what I identify as. No one else can answer that for you. Therefore, what your boyfriend gets you for a gift is between the two of you. Honestly, your aunt sounds toxic.
W boyfriend. Your aunt can stay bitter.
Tell her to mind her own business.
Unless you're like 12 and he's like 24 or something. There's gotta be more to this, right? This seems very obviously like she's in the wrong so far.
Sounds like a good present to me. Why does she care? She sounds controlling
Not weird at all, matter of fact it seems very endearing. Its unsurprising that she feels that way though, given that she probably doesn't understand why you would want those things.
I think that’s honestly really sweet of your boyfriend. They’re trying to be affirming of your gender id.
I’ve given that stuff to my partner as gifts. It’s not weird or inappropriate at all. Sounds like your aunt is just upset by you having those things and it’s just her excuse so she seems less transphobic
I think it's pretty sweet of him
I think your aunt can shut her yaps
Tell her to mind her own business
Depends on the boxers.

If someone gave me some generic Fruit of the Loom boxers for a holiday gift I think it'd be weird too, especially since I prefer briefs, but some cool looking underwear from a brand I'd actually wear, like Blackcraft Cult would be rad.
I really wish sometimes I could just live with my bf but sadly I'm only 15 and I'd need a lottt of paperwork for that..
I just remembered something she was only a tad weirded out by the boxers but drawed the line at my binder (I have plans on getting top surgery when I get legally and financially able)
There's cis women that prefer boxers for one if this is an Identity thing. 

Theres nothing wrong with him buying you those things, it's something you wanted / needed he's doing a great job as your BF. 

I'm sorry your aunt is being like that.
Fuck your aunt
Who gives a shit what your aunt thinks about your underwear. Not really her business, eh? You can tell her as much.
Boxers are way too expensive lol. Of course it’s not weird, you received a gift which you want and that’s Christmas
Uno reverse card, your aunt is the weird one, boom.
Get girl boxers. You will thank yourself
Not Any More Weird Then Getting Someone Any Other Type Of Clothing As A Gift, If Anything I'd Argue It's Less So.
Someone getting something they want isn’t weird.  If it’s supposed to be something about it being “inappropriate”, I watched adults get things like home brewing kits for various spirits when I was like 3 or 4 at gift exchanges and nobody tried to usher me out of the room or shamed the givers/receivers for giving such gifts in front of a child.
It is weird, but not because it isn't good, just rather different and high possibility of failure.

If you like them and they fit then it isn't weird. It is endearing. As the most inappropriate part is if he gets the size wrong and you have to deal with trying to change sizes or what not.

What one gets their lover is special to the lover and telling of how close, strong their communication, and such.  

Just a note. My friends and family don't think getting someone stuff like that is normal as long as you know the size. And if you don't, make a trip of it. Shop and eat a meal out to get more of a fun time from it.
Relationship goals 🥺
For Christmas las year I asked my friends for boxers lol. Same as gifting socks or shit. Not weird to me
She has no control or influence over you, or at least shouldn't. It's YOUR relationship.
I think your aunt should mind there own business. Your bf didn't buy them for your aunt to wear.
it's lovely that he got you sth that you want and like, no matter what anyone else says 🫶🏻
I think you already have your own opinion on it and shouldn’t need to seek the validation of internet strangers when it comes to the matter of what your life partner gives you.
She just thought it was inappropriate
She should not do that. 

It’s really a good sign when a partner listens to your needs and supports you,
Anybody who tries to control your relationships is manipulative, if possible you should limit the contact you have with her for your safety, especially if asking her to respect your boundaries doesn’t work.
Slap her, for us?
Mustard gas her ass
 I'm 15 I honestly got Soo scared yesterday because I thought she was going to make me throw away my binder and make me break up with my boyfriend
I wasn't planning on it XD I have a future planned with him already at 15
Right, maybe mentioning that it’s not sexual, it’s gender affirming (and maybe that he wouldn’t have to buy them for you if your guardians provided you with what you need, but it sounds like she hadn’t).
Well, as a former wayward youth I can say that’s also probably not a good idea either, but you’ll get through this time and make it to the place where you have control over your own life and choices and freaking underwear (geez!) soon. Hang in there.
I'm a non binary transmasc (they/he) XuX and I own a shit ton of girls boxers
They're just clothes... It's not like he bought you a dildo or skimpy lingerie or something. I'm sorry she's being so dumb.
her response is inappropriate. marry this man and be you!
My parents often got me and my brother underwear and socks as Xmas gifts, don't see why this is really any different
If someone was to buy a cis guy boxers for Christmas, would she still consider it inappropriate?

If the answer is no, I don’t think she’s sexualizing the underwear itself, she’s sexualizing queer people doing anything to acknowledge who they are
Ah yes, the most inappropriate thing anybody could ever happen upon… UNDERWEAR!!!
She can fuck off :)
You could also explain that the binder is just a shirt and the boxers are a lot more comfy if she asks a lot of questions, clothes are just pieces of fabric that work for you depending on what you want, some people want them to be pretty, others want them to be comfy (I used to say this back when I was your age and being tomboyish). Although is not the best, it might help you get out of trouble.
Ah okay. If you’re 15 then maybe just try to open these presents privately so you don’t have to deal with judgement from assholes. Have the family gift you give to each other be a proxy present like something extremely cheap but kinda thoughtful/funny like “oh wow I wanted this!” That way they don’t think anything of it.
Make you? What kind of control do you think your aunt will exert?
That's good. I'm happy for you! Stay strong friend!
Ik it's just really stupid living in her house XuX
But I don't like them too much
Even if he did he’s their boyfriend….you can buy your SO sex toys with their consent
She already knows what a binder is XuX and she already knows I'm trans she just thinks I'm still a trans man
Really. I wouldn't be without them.   
Each to their own. 💙
Maybe not the best to unveil that around family though. But yeah, it’s not weird, so long as you keep it private between you two and anyone else who all parties are comfortable including.
She just doesn't support and has made fun of me being trans..
Men's boxers don't mess with my disphoria XuX I only like wearing skirts and stuff but other than that I don't like girls stuff I'm sorry x.x
Damn it, why do families have to be such pain in the ass.
Wear what makes you feel happy. I'm not the Enby fashion police
I have no idea XuX ive felt like this since 7th grade but I thought I was trans now I'm back to trans and nonbinary they/he
Im sorry this person has so much control over your life, clothing, and relationships, that sucks. Stay safe and stay true to yourself, it'll get better and you'll be free to live your best queerest life in just a handful of years"	yidvc1	NonBinary	220	0.99	2022-10-31 14:34:35
People around me say I can’t be non binary because I’m making my girl dog “girly”	i recently got a puppy. shes a little girl and the most precious thing.  a lot of the stuff I’m getting for her is pink or has flowers or is stereotypically ”girly” I just think it looks good (I love florals and she looks good in pink) and idk maybe im getting all the stuff because i like it but struggle with it for myself because that makes me even more femme even though i wish i wasnt but idk really. Anyway people close to be are continually making comments that if I’m so nonbinary why am I making my girl dog so girly. I literally do not know how to respond or what to do. It doesn’t matter but it feels like they’re using this to invalidate my identity and I dont like that. What can I say back or how do I handle this? It feels like the dumbest thing but it’s starting to make me really uncomfortable	"You are non binary not the dog.. plus flowers aren't just for girls and clothes are for everyone
People around you are looking for excuses to be assholes.
Dogs have no gender, only sex. You could dress them as a space alien and it would make no difference. Rude and moronic comment from whoever is saying that to you.
You can be nonbinary without being a gender abolitionist.
Maybe to others it’s all girly stuff but you just like seeing your precious pup surrounded by flowers and pink! Also girly stuff is adorable okay?!? It brings me joy even though I’m non-binary. My personal aesthetic is business goth but when it comes to decor i prefer it to be adorable and colorful.
Because you want to. Being nonbinary does not mean you can’t appreciate feminine things. 

Full stop.
I’m NB and enjoy how much of a Little Dude my cat is. He is so Bro and stereotypically tomcat. Pets have their own personalities and it’s fine to embrace that with whatever feels right for your family!
Jesus Fucking Christ that’s the STUPIDEST THING I ever heard.
Those people want an excuse to question you and your identity. They’re being really rude and ridiculous. Congrats on your pup! You sound like a fantastic pet owner!
Do they have kids?

Dress your daughter like a girl? You must be a woman. Dress your son like a boy? You must be a man.

Straight up idiotic excuses they’re making.
I mean personally I always thought the best part of being enby was not having to worry about gender norms XD. Might sound a little confrontational but honestly my best defense against the questioning and second -guessing was firing back with ""yeah, so what?"" A couple of times it's actually helped me explain what being nonbinary actually means, especially since a lot of people only have the fully androgynous stereotype in their head.
That’s honestly hilarious imo I would just laugh
I used to (when I was a teenager) dress my dog up in dresses all the time and make her very pink and girly and I’m transmasculine. I think it may have been because, back then (I’m 31 now), I really wanted to wear girly stuff so I would “fit in” with everyone else, but it made me super dysphoric and I couldnt wear it, so I got all the things I wanted to wear and put it on my dog, so I could still enjoy it, just not on me
Excuse me, so you are buying accessories for YOUR DOG, and people say that just because YOUR DOG looks girly, you can't be non-binary?! Are people now basing your gender on DOGS ACCESSORIES THAT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE
Personally, I'd be inclined to say something like ""whether you're joking or serious, you're incorrect and being transphobic. We can talk about why what you're saying is wrong, but if you care about me at all, you need to stop."" In my experience, telling someone that they're being transphobic is a very quick way to determine whether or not they're worth keeping around, because either they engage with it in a productive way and they have potential or they get shitty and it's time to part ways.


That said, you don't owe anyone your labor to explain why they're in the wrong, so please don't feel like I'm suggesting you should have to do anything in particular. Take whatever steps you need to so that you can feel ok and safe around your friends.
Do they literally ever bring up the gender identity of themselves/other people they know in direct relation to their pets? Like are they asking their cis friends why their dog is a different gender than them? Seems like a weird and fixative thing to ever mention about your friends.
What the dog doin has nothing to do with your gender identity (lmao sorry, I just had to incorporate that meme in my response).
Safe to say the people around you are assholes
Saying a nonbinary person shouldn't be allowed to decorate a dog to look girly is like saying an artist shouldn't be allowed to keep their dog from chewing their paintbrushes. Gender identity is a complicated thing that takes a lot of brainpower to do, like art. No matter how much I love my dog, I have to admit that she's not bright enough to experience gender identity.
Tell them that if they're women, why do they dress their boys in all blue? And vice versa.

I'm sorry this is happening to you. But it doesn't make your gender any less valid! You got this, friend! Also, dogs in pink and floral are adorable
If you referred to your puppy with they/them pronouns, dressed them only in grey, and insisted that the puppy was nonbinary, people would think you were crazy for ""forcing your gender onto a dog"". There's no winning, people will criticize nonbinary people for whatever we do.
Your gender identity dosage extend beyond yourself. Not any more than if you had a kid. 

I know for me my little I’ve been calling her a girl. It’s easier unless she’s big enough to decide for herself. But I do let her decide activities and fashion. She likes pink, purple, lace, flowers, and hot wheels.

I’m not a fan of “girly”.. like guys can’t like pink without being less a man or something. It’s just a style. Oddly I do like feminine.. maybe it’s the way it feels when I say it. It’s a fun word. I also think most things have a feminine and masculine side to them. Not just people. Nothing wrong with that. Our personal balance and what makes us happy is part of what makes us unique… Dogs really can’t express gender even if they had a concept for it. They can’t see pink or purple. They don’t know people have labeled bedazzled things and lace girly.. it’s just a thing mostly. Unless it makes living their lives difficult. 

It’s just very silly the whole thing
I'm an afab nb with long hair that regularly wears makeup and dresses. I'm still nb when I do that, I just look smoking hot. I agree with everyone else that those people are just being assholes. The point of nb is to do whatever gendered stuff makes you happy at any point, so they can fo
You're nonbinary, your dog isn't. What's hard to understand?  Lmao.
This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard, sorry you have to deal with this brain melting nonsense. Why would dogs follow human gender norms? Esp when a lot of us humans think they're meaningless in the first place? Like a lot of humans don't think there's any such thing as a 'girl color,' why the FUCK would a dog? Dogs are colorblind and flowers rule, both you and your dog deserve to be spared this weird binary gender norm projection, end of conversation.
You don’t have to project your gender in the dog, the dog doesn’t give a rats ass what you gender it as so long as you treat it with love.
they can suka phatwon i buy my boy dogs pink stuff all the time. they even have pink heart tags.
None of that stuff is “girly,” inherently. It’s just stuff. Gender expression comes from what lines up with your *feelings*. If you wear a bunch of pink and florals and feel like that feels “girly” to you, then that’s girly. Same could be true for like, dark flannels, or long hair, or a pixie cut, or anything else. It doesn’t mean it’s “girly” to someone else, but the way that you are expressing yourself with it may be girly, if that’s what feels good to you that’s fine.

However, since the stuff is for the dog, it’s really just stuff. If someone thinks it’s not “non-binary enough” to put your dog in pink and florals, then ask them why they think pink and florals are gendered? Does that mean non-binary people and men can’t wear pink and florals without being “girly”? We all know that’s not true. Pointing out the fallacies in their insults will dry them up.
Just like men can like girly things and not be a girl, you can be nb and like girly things (unless you dont like them for your dog for being femme, which woulc be okay... if you like them just cause it's florals and pink then it doesnt even have anything to do with being femme). 

Either way the people around you are being assholes. I get that a lot too and it is infuriating. Hang in there, and it's so wholesome how much you love your little pup!
Happy cake day, OP 🖤
It’s completely beside the point, but after watching episode 4 of canine intervention on Netflix I stopped putting clothes on my dog. Granted he’s a pitbull lol.
I got my intersex cat a floofy flower collar that’s super girly, but we call him a he. Turns out cats don’t care what they wear.
I feel sligthly dumber after reading that
They are showing their ignorance. You should not have to do the emotional labor of educating them. 

I think I might prepare a pre-packaged statement, such as “am I correct in understanding that you think these flowers negate my gender identity? Interesting.” 

“Oh, I didn’t realize that being NB meant that I can’t enjoy flowers anymore. Thanks for setting me straight.” /s 

Flowers are universal. And NB means we can either be androgenous or gender fluid. What’s important is that you express yourself in the ways that are natural and comfortable to you. They don’t have to understand.
Ok but what do cis people’s brains work this way? Reminds me of back it the day i had a partner who was non-binary (I still thought i was cis at the time) and I explained it to my mother. And one of her first questions was something along the line of “but their pet rabbit is a girl, do they understand that?” 

I am still baffled as to why non-binary people owning pets that have binary sexes is a difficult concept for people to grasp.
Lmao that’s the wildest thing I’ve ever heard 😭 people have some super strange takes sometimes you can absolutely be nb and give your female dog “girly” stuff!! I’m not sure what I’d say to people other than just sort of staring at them lol, gender is fake and applying human gender roles to dogs is wack
I literally put my boy cat in blue collars and sweaters because they look nice on him.

Doesn't mean I'm suddenly not trans-nonbinary.

They're expecting you to fit ""woke"" narrative where you AND your pet are both gender non-conforming. It's not your fault you see pink flowers as pink flowers and they see v•ginas and flowers as things to put in a neat little gender box.
Aside from the fact that your dog is its own thing, do people not realize NB also isn't directly related to how you dress and act? I'm AMAB and I dress both masculine and feminine depending on the day.
so they are confused at how you are presenting your dog? Dude.... It's a dog. And it's not your fault that the items that you find cute for your dog are Fem.

That being said, how do they not know your dog doesn't just like those things?  I had a male dog, it thought it was a female cat. we gave it cat toys and girly things because that was what it liked. And yes we know it thought it was a female cat with the number of times it stole kittens to try to raise and would be scared of other dogs and puppies.
How old are these people around you?
That’s fucking stupid. Tell them as much.
11/10
my thoughts exactly… unlike a child (or any other person for that matter) who has their own idea of who they are and will become, it does no one any damage to gender and dress a dog how you like
For that matter, you can also be a gender abolitionist who likes the color pink. Dismantling the gender binary doesn't mean making everything beige.
Absolutely. Pink on me? No. Nasty. Yucky. Major dysphorios. Pink on my pup? Fetching. Tres elegante. She is the moment.
I think that’s really what I’m doing here too. I love all the stuff but on me it makes me look even more like a cis girl so I’m getting it for her because I still like it but she doesn’t care what’s on her stuff lol
I felt a lot dumber after the 5th person said the same thing to me lol

I’m terrified of talking to the people in my life about my gender. I’m hoping posting here will help me be more confident in finding and expressing my identity.		"I was pretty terrified about it too because my mums a pretty conservative catholic. She would always get angry at me when I was younger if I tried to do feminine things. I don’t even live in the same country any more so I though fuck it while a drunk at my brothers wedding and came out to her as enby. It went well! She told me it makes sense and that she will love me what ever. The only thing that really changes is that she doesn’t give me “that look” when I wear makeup. Still pretty awful at them/they but one step at a time.

So my point is that it might just be fine! You might just feel like it’s a weight of your shoulders. Good luck! <3
I totally feel this. I'm out to a lot of my friends, but not my family. You are 100% valid whether you come out or not, and you never owe anyone information about your gender identity, especially if you don't think they'll be supportive. Know that you have a community here to support you! You look like a lovely elf friend and I hope this subreddit gives you some confidence and joy 💚
Hi terrified of talking to the people in my life about my gender, I’m dad and I’m proud of you.
I was absolutely terrified to come out to my last immediate family member, my oldest brother, who historically hasn't seemed very tolerant. He's sort of a hick and has made a lot of homophobic and transphobic jokes over the years, and I had convinced myself it was going to turn into a fight. I wrote a whole script for myself and called him last week.

It went so incredibly well. Like better than the other conversations I had with family. And when we said goodbye at brunch the other day he gave me a long hug and said, ""I love you. YOU. Not she, or he, or whatever. I love you."" 

Sometimes people surprise you. Lead with love, and they may follow your example. You got this!!
Understandable! Know that no matter what happens, we are here for you 💕
Thank you for all of the kind responses. I just got the chance to read them all. It means a lot to me to know that there’s people out there so ready to support others. I appreciate it ☺️

For the Enbies. Where are you on the Gender Spectrum?	"Hi there, I'm conducting a poll on a few Queer subreddits. I'm curious to what the results will be. I tried to include as much as I could, but Reddit only allows 6 slots in a Poll, so I had to clump some stuff together. Please be respectful in the comments.
Also, if your identity is a combination of two or more of the options in the poll, please choose ""Other"".

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/pql81l)"	"I like velociraptors. It's like deadly but cute size deadly. And the flapflap dinosaur! Like flying dinosaurs. Incredible
I am personally reclaiming the word ""Abomination"".
My true form is that of something horrible and incomprehensible.
Agender gang where you at?
Both non-binary and agender
I am nonbianry. I am genderqueer and trans as well. My gender happens to also always be nonbinary, and it’s fluid and sometimes nonexistent in a way that feels agender. So I’ll default to nonbinary, but I have all these things also tied up in it.
Where’s the option for being hot af, cause that’s mine
Non-binary woman, like... on the edge. (Demi girl may fit, but I'm not 100% sure. I'm happy enough to not delve too deep)
I usually say nonbinary, but I don't particularly have the desire to label it, and it feels kinda personal anyway. I take a "" these are my pronouns, the rest is none of your business"" approach.
I answered Other. My gender is maverique which falls under the nonbinary umbrella but is it’s own gender identity
[deleted]
Both option 1&5. I Don't Know which to pick
Trans guy/demiboy/ **nonbinary?**
r/dinosaurs
I consider myself non binary genderfluid, at times maybe more demigirl but other times bordering trans guy. Dinosaurs are fun though
I dont really perceive my own gender, so agender
Demigenderflux is where I place myself. I feel agender sometimes, sometimes my gender is stronger, and I'll feel weakly feminine at times and demiboy at my most masc
Bigender - She/They

(Non-Binary + Female)
I identify as ✨agenderflux✨
These answers are not really good
Growing up I thought I knew a decent amount about dinosaurs but I have come to terms with the fact I know very little

I do not feel like I can submit any information that you don't already know, my apologies
I use trans masc for right now so I guess that would be demiboy. Still trying to figure out if I’m nonbinary trans masc or fully FtM. Gender is hard sometimes
I’m AMAB and partially identify as male. Where I fall on the spectrum shifts from day-to-day. Sometimes I feel masculine, and sometimes I feel more in the middle. I go with NB for the sake of simplicity.
I have bpd, which causes me identity issues, and recently found the label “bordergender” which perfectly characterizes my confusion. It’s a rare label and sort of odd label, but it’s what makes me feel most comfortable.
Where my fellow multigender folks at?
Can we get an option for “micro labels are hurting our community, especially the racially and socioeconomically oppressed ones”?
As someone who is genderfluid, dinosaurs will always be awesome!
which one is just 'unsubscribe'?
I'm leaning towards more of transgender but I'm not fully ready to identify as that, so I'm just bigender for now
Other: I'm probably in the demigirl catagory. But it just doesn't feel right to me so I'll keep it on Trans Femme Non-binary.
Recently figured out instead of being a demiboy that I'm boyux
I identify as gendernull, A.K.A. I have a gender, but that gender is nonexistent. It is a thing and that thing is nothing

Long story short, my gender is [REDACTED]
Demigirl/agender/genderqueer
Autigender
I used to think I was agender but now I think I might be genderfluid but it comes out in really weird ways.
I'd describe my gender as butch
Genderqueer nonbinary man
Proxvir but occasionally it's fluid on the not-quite-male to everything not feminine spectrum.
Non-binary Transfeminine - see https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Sexes#Assigned_male_at_birth. Disregard link wording.
Aporagender
I consider myself boyflux
**AAAAAAAAAAAAAA**
I am both genderfluidflux and polygender lol
Agender/autiegender/neuroqueer
All and none. Too much pressure to label myself as something other than non-binary
i usually call myself just nonbinary, but truly i feel multigender, and i dont even know what mix of genders but i certainly feel a lot of them !!
im agender but i heavily agree with talking about dinosaurs
i'm a man in a woman way and a woman in a man way also neither and both at the same time. hope this helps <3

also my favorite dinosaur is charcharodontosaurus. big boi.
I identify as Genderqueer and Genderfluid, but I am never 100% a single gender if that makes sense. AMAB on HRT for 4 years.
Made the multigender category into 69 😎
I Contain Multitudes
We are legion
I feel like I'm sort of somewhere in between demigender and gender fluid??? Like I like my AMAB body for the most part, but I also like to present more feminine, it helps that I have a naturally feminine phisique in general, but prefer feminine labels as opposed to most masculine ones. So there's definitely a preference but idk what exactly that falls into. I thought demiboy at first, but idk
mostly non-binary but also i don’t know
neutrois is the closest label i've been able to find, and in lieu of that, i just go by non-binary. in unconventional terms, i will semi-ironically say that my gender is just ""bitch""
my favorite is pteranadons. they fly, mild fuzz, like fish, cool head, love it all
Anyone ever read about how Firgolgs in 5e handle names? That but gender:p
Lurking transfem who joined out of curiosity lmao
A question about the poll-are we meant to vote everytime we see it, or just once? This is the second time I've seen it, and I've voted both.
I'm NB but present masculine and have a connection to masculinity.
Please someone talk about Dinos with me 🥺
Agender now but I consider myself a bit more of a agender-demiboy if that makes any ounce of sense.
Yeah, why aren't we talking about dinosaurs? Did you know that the fastest animal in the world is a flying dinosaur that eats other dinosaurs?
Transfem here. Not a trans woman but i don't usually call myself nonbinary
the terms i use in order of most liked to least: butch, nonbinary, trans-androgynous, multigender, genderqueer, genderfluid.

edit: also while i like dinosaurs i’m biased in favor of temnospondyls over most lizards.
I think agender, even if i reference myself as female, it's only a formality. I feel like nothing, observing my life through my body. I have always felt like this for as long as i can remember.
Demi- and multigender. Because apparently my brain couldn't decide and took only a little bit of two.
nby man but like only a little. like if i was born a guy i wouldnt be trans but im also comfortable as nonbinary
We're no longer part of the Spectrum. We're above the Spectrum. Over it. Beyond it. We're ""them."" We're ""they."" We are the Enbies in Black.
Multigender and genderfluid lol he/she/they swinging back and forth
I always like to switch between using nb/ gender fluid because for me, that’s what i connect to the most.
I identified as genderfluid for a while but now I think I might be a demiboy or a trans man but idk :/
Raptors are great, I'm a big fan of deinonychus. (I feel like a small raptor would be the way to go if you were to get a dinosaur pet)

I like therizinisaurus too, they were *weird*.
T. rex is my favorite dinosaur (you could probably tell from my username). In addition to all the obvious reasons, it’s got some really interesting features as well. 

It had one of the best senses of smell and vision of all dinosaurs. It’s jaws were more built for crushing bone instead of just ripping through flesh. It’s teeth were serrated in a way that meat would get caught in them and rot, so if its prey escaped it could die from infection.

Plus, if you’ve played Saurian (highly recommended for any dinosaur fans), you’ll know that the environment it lived in was BEAUTIFUL!
I like Triceratops the most
Another Dino Nerd! (>▽<)

I like raptors too. They're like Birds of prey combined with Big Cats or Canines. Also, the flying things, which are called Pterosaurs, aren't actually Dinosaurs. They're their own thing. The term ""Arcosaur"" includes stuff like  Dinos, Flappyflaps, Prehistoric Sea Monsters and stuff like that, so you could use that from now on.
Based.
heyoooo 🙌
Hi!
Watup fuck a gender who needs it
sup fam
To me non binary is both an identity and an umbrella term, so I chose agender
Same here! It's hard for me to only identify as just one of those
Non-binary is a broad term. Agender is a specific term. Your being mildly repetitive. 

I like to say non-binary trans femme tho. So we all do it. But yeah like trans femme is easiest to say for me. But it is a non-binary label. Anything that isn’t trans man and trans women can fit under non-binary. 

So I think as far as real life offline goes, for the non-lgbt people, it can benefit us if we don’t overwhelm them with too many terms. I mean as they ask questions open up and educate them.
Saaaame. I always known I was cisn't (ie. not cis) but I didn't really start using the term nonbinary until recently.  I love that nonbinary includes so many...options? Lol.
Literally your using multiple umbrella terms. Trans and non-binary then genderqueer/fluid/agender. All terms are technically trans identities. The latter ones being the most specific. Trans is the most broad, then enby, then the rest. 

You can use them however you like, don’t let my input here try and change anything. 

But personally I pick using the specific or broad terms to start with normies. One or the other. And then I lean towards the opposite for a more broad term or a more specific one depending on their attitude towards understanding. 

I’m finding it’s all a waste and I just want lgbt and trans specifically friends. Cis people I’m finding exhausting and impossible to relate to as I’m starting to socially transition.
I used to know what maverique meant but forgot, could you explain it to me?
I mean Genderless is usually used for things like Deities or Mythical Creatures, So yeah, I guess it does sound cool.
You could pick Other.  I wanted to write ""Combination of two or more of the above options"" in the 6th option but I'd reached the character limit.
Bigender prob
Wdym?
That sounds like Boyflux or Demiboyflux. Have you considered using those labels?
Yes.
What's autiegender? Also, what does neuroqueer mean? It sounds like you're  queer in your brain?
Nice!
Multigender?
I usually just tell people I'm nonbinary and I don't usually get questioned further.
Deinonychuses are really cool. They're basically larger Velociraptors. Also Velociraptors were probably much  smaller than most people think. They probably didn't get taller than 2 feet. 

Therizinosauruses are so epic. Especially some of the newer reconstructions. They look like the Dinosaur Frankenstein.
Have you played The Isle? The therizinosaurus in that game is what Freddy Krueger would look like if he was an emu!

People call it the danger floof
I really like watching PBS Eons, which is where most of my dino knowledge comes from.
They're neat as well!
There are also flying dinosaurs. Flamingos for example
Flappyflaps™
How did you add your pronouns under you name like that?
I don’t say that whole thing, I just fall under both of those categories
Yes, I am.

When there’s a text box entry “what’s your gender?” I usually write it as: transgender nonbinary genderqueer. All of these are umbrellas but also my specific identity. The rest of the things just describe shared experiences with others beyond my overall identity.

When trying to explain to anyone in person or coming out, I literally just say I’m nonbinary, and I’ll make it clear I care about trans issues and consider myself as such as it’s relevant. Most people don’t need to hear the intricacies, all I need is the right forms of address and I keep it very simple.

Trans folks make good friends, it’s easier to just chill and not worry about gender around them. Cis people can be like this too but when you’ve got a group of folks who really get it (and aren’t interested in policing and gatekeeping), wow it’s really freeing.
Sure, the actual definition is “characterized by autonomy and inner conviction regarding a sense of self that is entirely independent of male/masculinity, female/femininity or anything which derives from the two while still being neither without gender nor of a neutral gender”. I experience it as my gender is not related to nor partially man or woman, but unlike agender I do have a strong sense of having a gender. If I were trying to explain to someone outside the community, I’d probably say “my gender is best described as person, not man or woman”
[deleted]
Other it is
You might want to allow selection of multiple and put an abinary and xenine option
Many of these categories overlap
Yeah, that’s what I chose on the poll. While they technically fit, I feel like just saying non binary gives a more accurate idea of who I am, is easier to explain, and allows more “wiggle-room” in case I ever feel more on the fem side. 

Demiboy or boyflux is kinda how I feel atm
Hey, thanks for asking! Lol, it does sound like that, huh? Autiegender is when one's perception and expression of gender is indivisible from one's specifically autistic perception and expression of gender. Because autism has one learning social expectations, including gender roles, in a far different way than a neurotypical, one's understanding of gender roles may only make sense in the context of autism.
Neuroqueer is a more broad context of the intersectionality of neurodiversity (ADHD, OCD, ASD, etc.) with sexuality and gender - so, when one's queerness is expressed indivisibly from one's neurodiversity, and/or vice versa.
genderfluid (...kinda?)

my gender kinda ping-pongs all over the board all the time
Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.

God, I haven't talked about dinosaurs with anyone since I was like, 12? This is so weird to have brought up.

I remember watching a documentary on unusual dinosaur specimens, and one of the last ones they covered was the Therizinissaurus. I thought ""there's no way this thing eats anything other than eggs"" and the narrator was all ""its a gosh dang herbivore, dontcha know! And it's a theropod!""

I really identified with it's weird sort of ""not quite one thing or the other"" vibe, I guess.
Yeah birds are Dinos too! When I say Dino I'm referring to Non Avian Dinosaurs (aka not birds or the ones that went extinct). Birds are Avian Dinosaurs (the ones that survived the extinction). Also some birds are basically just raptors which look different, like Cassowaries.
Try editing the custom flair.
On PC, after selecting an adjustable flair for the subreddit you're in, there's a textbox under the flair selection, above the apply button. You can use that to write pretty much anything under the character limit. In his case, the pronouns to use, in my case, the gender identity. You can also use it for something silly like ""No gender, only robot"". I just advise to make it somehow related to the sub in question, but other than that you can just go nuts with it.
Basically if I tell someone I’m trans femme. And they are lgbt I’m gonna somewhat assume they know I’m non-binary. 

I’ve considering using demigirl, genderfluid, and bi-gender. 

And if I did use any of those I’d prob assume other lgbt people know that those fall under trans non-binary labels. 

While we’re commenting here. I’m really trying to understand why some people identify as non-binary, but don’t identify as trans.

Not identifying as a man or woman seems pretty much “I don’t identify with the gender I was assigned at birth” so that spells trans spectrum to me. 

I TOTALLY understand not wanting to use the trans word as part of your label out of fear of being persecuted. But I just struggle to get people that say they are enby but that they aren’t trans.
Omg you just put into words but I’ve been trying to describe for years, thank you
I'm imagining an Centaur running through a taiga forest. The Centaur has a moustache and a long, braided beard. The Centaur has long eyelashes and dark eyeshadows, and makeup on their face. They're wearing a sparkly, light blue and silver jacket with sequins on it, and a skirt with the same colour, sparkle, and sequins on it as well. The Centaur has a muscular and athletic body, and yet, has a feminine charm.  People speak of the mysterious and beautiful creature in the woods, and are in awe when they catch a glimpse of it.

I just imagined that. It's weird ik. And also, I know that not all Enbies are Androgynous, but that kind of presentation just went well with this character so that's why they're Androgynous.
I wish I could both of those things, but Reddit doesn't let you do that on polls and I can't put more than 6 options. This site is in serious need of improvement. 
Also, what does Abinary mean? I've heard of it before but don't really know the difference between it and Non Binary, so it would be really helpful if you told me the difference.
Yeah, I know that. I wanted to write ""Combination of two or more of the above options"" in the 6th one, but I'd reached the character limit. People who Identity with two or more can pick ""Other"" (I wrote that in the post)
Good bot
Thanks!
Thank you!
I think that we all come to these words at different times and they have slightly different meanings to us based on the people we know who use them and how we see ourselves in relation.

For me I was very much in line with other trans people I knew at the time I was exploring trans identity and my gender. I feel a very strong community connection to this word and my people. Now though if my introduction was when I stumbled into a group that was very trans medicalist or generally nonbinary exclusionary I would have had that as my first impression. Plus, yes a lot of people have heard the message that you have to meet some metric of suffering to be trans, well not only do we often have impostor syndrome, but who wants to be labeled solely based on suffering??

It’s really easy not to feel like you can use a word when people yell at you for using it and claim you’re stealing it from them.

On the other hand, there’s a really easy distinction where some people who are agender see transgender as inherently having a gender to transition to and therefore don’t want to use it. Similarly to how some also don’t use nonbinary as they see it as implying a gender.

There are plenty of other reasons people don’t use the trans label and they can explain better than I can, since I do use it.
Same here! I was trying to describe this yesterday. Like my gender is... Personal? Its me? I have one! Its just not... Male or female or fluid. Thank you for the new term.
No problem, when I learned the term I was like THAT’S IT, that’s what I’ve been trying to explain for the last decade!
Non-binary genders are in the spectrum between masculine and feminine. Abinary genders are in the spectrum unrelated to masculine and feminine.
Username checks out.
That’s what I was hoping it was. Not something like gatekeeeping or transmedicalism. 

Suffering not required to be trans. I don’t even consider viewpoints like that. It’s not an opinion, they are just wrong. “Gold star” trans people or anyone else that’s exclusive and elitist doesn’t get any respect from me.
Oh, that's the difference. Thanks for telling me! I hope you have a nice day! <3
From my understanding, nonbinary genders CAN be somewhere on or between the masculine/feminine spectrum, but don't have to be. (like being a nonbinary transmasculine person would be on the masculine side of the spectrum). So is abinary considered a specification within the nonbinary umbrella of being unialigned with any binary gender? This was a new term to me so I'm just asking questions because the prefixes “non” and “a”seem to mean the same thing. 

(yes i did google first because i dont want to be a burden but I also know hearing from people with direct experience with labels can be more accurate)
One thing I try and keep in mind is that a lot of people are coming to this at a very young age where they’re more likely to internalize the first message they get. Not everyone online is at an age where they can set aside what someone says as being potentially irrelevant or plain ignorant.
Sure, you too!
Unaligned/neutral-aligned non-binary is sometimes used interchangeably with abinary. Essentially both terms indicate a similar concept, outside of the masculine-to-feminine spectrum.

Non-binary includes a lot of identities that abinary does not, however. For example, someone who identifies as demigirl may identify as non-binary but they would not be abinary
Right! That makes a lot of sense just cheking. So abinary can be in the nonbinary umbrella. But not evryrhing in the nonbinary umbrella is abinary. Square/rectangle situation. 

The first answer could be read as “nonbinary identities always fall within the binary” which didnt make any sesne to me. Thank you so much for the response and clarity! (idk how to use tone markers this is genuine thanks)"	pql81l	NonBinary	213	0.98	2021-09-18 12:06:04
I don't know what to do	"When I (19NB) came out to my friend (20F), I sent her a link to a 'What's my gender identity quiz' as a fun activity because I was nervous about telling her straight up.

My results showed I was transgender and I shared it with her she was like ""nah, you're a woman. Everything about your body says so.""
And she's been saying stuff like ""that's my girl!"" or calling me a woman because she knows I don't like that.

I told her I don't mind her using she/her for me because there are no gender neutral pronouns in my language.

This really makes me sad, she's my friend for 7 years and the only friend I've ever had."	"If she won't stop treating you disrespectfully, you'll need to spend a lot less time with her just out of self-defense.  Explain that to her, and then follow-through if she doesn't start treating you with respect.
Real friendship involves respect for the other person. To intentionally misgender you and say things like that indicates she doesn't actually respect you. I can't advise you what to do, but if I were in that situation, I'd rather have fewer or no friends than a false friend who treated me poorly.
What she said about how ""everything about your body says woman"" is really bugging me, among every other dismissive thing she's said. We don't exactly have a great deal of control over the bodies we're born with and all.
Been in a similar situation. It really hurts when the person doubles down on the misgendering but it a seemingly “positive” way.
If you haven't been direct up until now, you should try that. Tell her straight up you're not a woman and she needs to stop referring to you as a woman or the friendship will end. If you're not willing to be direct with her, your options are to continue to deal with the situation as it is now or end the friendship.
Nope you gotta sit her down and show your serious, this is not ok to do and she's gotta know it is a big deal, tell her your serious about it and stand up for yourself even if it may be a bit scary because she's your friend, she's treating it like a joke but a joke shouldn't make someone uncomfortable to the point your asking for help
I'm gonna be completely blunt. That isn't a friend, that's emotional abuse. You deserve to be accepted and respected and embraced. I won't tell you what to do, as everyone handles problems differently but for me, I think I'd probably say some stuff to her that I ***should*** regret, but wouldn't. Friends don't do that, and I was once in a similar state of mind where I was perfectly okay with someone being shitty just because I wanted to have a friend. I eventually realized that I deserved better. ***You*** deserve better.
Did you actually tell her? 

With no other context, that quiz probably doesn’t seem like something to be taken seriously - not saying it wouldn’t be a hint, but if she did not actually hear (from your mouth or from your hints or otherwise) you say you’re nonbinary, maybe she doesn’t realize? Or at least the extent to how hurtful the comments are?

And if she does know, what you do is leave. Someone here suggested an ultimatum, and I think that’s fair. She’s been your friend, sure, but now she’s intentionally adding distress to your life/interactions, and that’s not a solid friendship now. She broke it.
“Everything about your body says so” 

Hell, everything about my body says I am an obese, lazy, cake lover! 

yet all my blood tests prove I have a great diet, have medical problems that keep my body large, and not to mention I take hikes, and have a housekeeping job. I also hate sweets. 🤷‍♀️ 


What you see on the outside is not some end all explanation of who you really are. Such bs 😞 sorry you have a “friend” like that..
>And she's been saying stuff like ""that's my girl!"" or calling me a woman because she knows I don't like that.

she's actively doing things you don't like BECAUSE she knows you don't like them. this girl is a horrible friend and you deserve so much better, i'm so sorry
I'm sorry, but the answer is to give her an ultimatum. If she doesn't stop purposefully misgendering you, stop talking to her. Honestly, I'd stop talking to her anyway. I know that losing a friend is absolutely horrible and painful, I've gone through it, but you will be better off on your own than with a friend who doesn't respect you. And at some point you will find new, better friends.
Sounds like a shitty ""friend"" You deserve better than that
buddy she ain't a real friend. if you think there's a chance she'll listen and change, sit her down, have a serious discussion and let her know that this is a big deal and she needs to stop. otherwise, it's best you try and ease yourself outta that friendship, and find some new buddies to hang with. good luck!!
Does your language have any neopronouns? I know some languages are making some, but it is most common in English. Sucks about your ""friend"" :( She seems like she's not going to be accepting of you. I hope she comes to her senses, but it doesn't seem likely to me.
have you tried lecturing her?
Well, just talk to her about how you feel about her telling about that stuff. Tell her that it hurts how she’s treating you, and if she doesn’t, try to spend less time away from her and more to yourself.
I know it’s harder said then done, but in my experience it’s been much easier to deal without people like that. I’m older than you - 32. My friend of 20 years ended our friendship when I came out. Of course it was upsetting. Way happier with friends who support me.
You can't control her reaction, only your own ♥️ Keep in mind that who YOU feel you are is all that matters. But it sounds like she's been a close friend otherwise, and that sucks. At the end of the day, all you can do is be honest with her about how her language makes you feel and take comfort in the fact that you did all you could do. The rest is up to her to put in the effort and be a good friend. Best of luck and remember that you deserve acceptance at the very least!!
Talk to her about it. Explain how important she is, and explain how important this is. She can take you as you are or leave you as you were.
if i were you, i'd try calmly correcting her. if she refuses to stop excessively calling you a woman, ask her specifically why. explain that gender and gender expression aren't set by birth sex. tell her that she wears pants (i'm assuming she's not from the 1850s here) and that a hundred years ago she would've been attacked like she's currently attacking you. ask if she would be happy if she had been born as a guy, or as intersex and her family incorrectly decided that she would be raised as a boy. these are just some suggestions of things that've helped me before. they might not work for you, but questioning her along these lines (like what if people didn't see her as the gender she wanted to be seen as) will probably start her in the process of accepting you.
Sorry you're dealing with that. Some people get upset when you challenge their idea of you. Dunno how long this has been going on, but if you let it keep going, it'll eat you like a cancer. She isn't being friends with you right now; she's being friends with her idea of you, while dismissing the actual you.

 I wish I had a magic spell that would make her turn this around, but I don't. You might need to brace yourself for a sad ending.

Please take care of yourself, be safe, reach out of you need help.
I’m curious, what language?
That’s not a friend
I would counter argue with something like: Since when gender is in the body? Gender is psychological and social. Get your facts checked. 

Also this might seem petty but- i would misgender her and when she says something, be like: oh im sorry i thought we were playing to gender other incorrectly

I know, im not fun at parties :(
i understand it can be hard but if she isnt accepting of you, distancing yourself is probably the best bet for your mental health. if possible you could maybe look for lgbtq groups in your area to see if you can makes some friends that are understanding of your gender identity?
Seek a professional therapist for an outside pro opinion.
That's easier said than done :(
Yeah! If she invalidates your experience because she ''believe'' you're woman, even if she loves you, she doesn't have the voice to explain you who you are.
One possible response to this is, ""Well my brain is a part of my body and my brain says otherwise ...""
Some people just dont understand :(

They think they are misgendering you for your own good...
Yes to this. Open and honest communication is super important in making any type of relationship be more effective, even if that means ending it due to incompatibility
Precisely
Other than the quiz, no, I didn't say anything.
She has a special place in my heart and I don't want to lose her and I'm scared of being alone.
There's a possibility that the intention isn't ""because she knows I don't like that"". Not to dismiss OP's experience at all - I would ask OP how do they know that is their friend's intention? It could be that there is very real evidence to base that POV on, but it's also a common thought-trap to project your own internalised transphobia onto others. (This is something I do ALL THE TIME.)

Could be that OP's friend is part of cis-het-normative society and thinks she is acting for the best. The question is whether she's open to listen in a more direct conversation, and then to make effort to do better.
Yeah and as part of this ultimatum give her a copy of the book Gender Outlaws and have her write you a book report on it. If you’re feeling kind you could make it a book club style discussion.
She would just dismiss it and say it's not a big deal
Arabic. It's a heavily gendered language.
Some therapy to help get you comfortable with asserting and defending boundaries would be really helpful for you, then.
I feel you. It seems the consensus in the community is to cut off / stop spending time with whoever doesn't acknowledge our identities, but if I did that I would lose so many friends and family, idk what I would do.
I know what you mean. It's too easy for us to dismiss your friendship without worrying about the consequences.

Remember tho: you aren't stuck with only her forever.  Try to make new friends, ones that start off respecting you. (Introvert here: I know that's also easier said than done.) Perhaps if she sees some examples of respectful friendship, she'll figure it out. Or, if she still doesn't, at least you won't be as alone.

Best wishes!
I’m assuming that space in your heart is because of your past relationship/experiences. None of those need to leave. They’ve happened already. Nothing about your response to this will cheapen those. 

But what’s going to happen if you don’t lose her intentionally or tell her straight that you’re trans is that her presence becomes one of anxiety. Sounds like it already has, maybe. And at that point what’s the point, ya know? 

Please think not about why you want a friend in your life but why you want *her* around. Besides the fact that you’ve been together a long time. And if you consider transphobic treatment a dealbreaker - which I highly recommend - then you need to either fix it (telling her and telling her how she better not refer to you, technically you can’t make her do anything) or break that seal.
If you haven't said anything other than the quiz she might be thinking that you shared the quiz with her because you're uncertain if you're 'womanly' enough to be a woman, instead of trying to say you're not a woman. She might be trying to encourage you with her words, and not realise that you came out as enby. Before dropping her I'd make sure you have stated clearly that you aren't a woman and that that's why you shared it, so you don't want to be called a woman.
you need a new friend
If something is a big deal to you and your friend doesn't think it's a big deal, they're not your friend because they don't care about the things that matter to you.
Yeah it sucks for people who have to deal with heavily gendered languages.
I'm sorry that you don't seem to have many friends, then, because someone who doesn't want to acknowledge your identity is not a friend.
I too am sorry that I don't have many friends. But I mean I've got what I've got."	voc2xk	NonBinary	208	1.0	2022-06-30 16:09:38
Happy Bisexual Visibility Day to my fellow Bi Nonbinary folks!	I used to feel strange & bad about my seemingly 'contradictory' identity but then started reading about the less restricting definitions of it - 2 or more, 'same' and 'other', for example. Just wanted to let you know you're not bad and there are others out there like us :) 	"Happy bi enby sounds! ^.^
Exactly!  Being bisexual has nothing to do with the inclusion (or exclusion) of trans or non binary people.
I'm glad you came to terms with it! I don't consider myself bi, but I can totally relate to having seemingly conflicting parts of identity--I call myself nonbinary and also a lady lately, and I had trouble reconciling that before. (Now: it's all good.) We're *complex*, and that's a great quality to have.

Happy Bi day!
Yessss other non**BI**nary people! :)

Happy bi visibility day. 
Same :)
I prefer to say I'm pansexual :)
Thanks! You too!
I had no idea this was today yay! Thank you for mentioning it :)
As a Bi Bear I humbly give you all a WOOF

Bisexual is a different thing from pansexual tho. And you can't choose your sexuality. So you can't really prefer to say one sexuality over another. If you say anything else than what your sexuality is, you would just be lying.


I'm not trying to be mean or anything. Just trying to fight some misconceptions about the difference between pansexuality and bisexuality because the whole ""bisexuality is exclusionary and pansexuality isn't"" misconception seem to be quite common.
>And you can't choose your sexuality. So you can't really prefer to say one sexuality over another. If you say anything else than what your sexuality is, you would just be lying.

I don't agree with this. People choose labels for their sexuality based on a variety of factors including social, cultural, and political. For instance, if a woman identifies as a lesbian and dates only women but enjoys having sex with a man once in a while, does that make her secretly bisexual or a liar? I don't think so, I consider that a totally valid way to identify. If she wanted to identify as bi, that's valid too. Sexuality is fluid for a lot of people too.
...

Is there really a distinct difference? Where it would be *wrong* for a bisexual to identify as pan?
Bisexual really glosses over the whole non-binary section of the gender spectrum so arguing this point on here seems a bit odd ... The prefix Bi (two) is part of the word
I can basically say I'm bi, pan, or just queer with how nebulous my sexuality is. I just switch based on which flag I think looks good that time.
There is a difference, but it's also not wrong for someone to identify as both.
I mean... Its as ""wrong"" as calling yourself heterosexual in the case that you are really bisexual, for example.


I seem to be commenting this a lot lately. But here is the difference:


>Pansexuality, or omnisexuality, is the sexual, romantic or emotional attraction towards people regardless of their sex or gender identity. Pansexual people may refer to themselves as gender-blind, asserting that **gender and sex are not determining factors** in their romantic or sexual attraction to others.


Bisexuality as my favorite quote from Robyn Ochs puts it:


> “I call myself bisexual because I acknowledge that I have in myself the **potential to be attracted** – romantically and/or sexually – to people of more than one sex and/or gender, not necessarily at the same time, not necessarily in the same way, and not necessarily to the same degree.”


If you are pansexual, someones gender is completely unrelated to your attraction to them. You would be equally attracted to every gender.


If you are bisexual, you are attracted to multiple genders, but you can be more attracted to certain genders than to others. 


So lets say you have multiple clones of the same person, identical in everything but their gender. Then a pansexual person would be equally attracted to each version. Where as a bisexual person would be more attracted to certain versions than others. 


So there could be some overlap in the case that you are equally attracted to all genders. But there still is a distinction between bisexuality and pan-sexuality. Not everyone who is bisexual can call themselves pansexual. So to me this just kinda felt like a weird place for u/AT_thruhiker_Flash to say that they ""prefer"" pan-sexuality. Especially when the post was about bi pride (because its bisexual visibility day). And it certainly has nothing to do with one of them being non binary exclusionary, like they suggested in the other comment.
It's unfortunately a common misconception.

Despite the way it might sound to some people, bisexuality does not exclude nonbinary genders. Bisexual just means being attracted to people of the same gender and people of at least one other gender. Or being attracted to two or more genders.
It doesn't. 


Homo means same. Hetero means different. Bi means both same and different. That's the two its reffering too. It has nothing to do with the amount of genders you are attracted to. 


That is exactly what OP mentioned in their post. So this whole bi erasure you're doing, on a post about non binary bi pride nontheless, is kinda fucked up.
Based on the quotes you posted, there is definitely room for overlap between the two.

>If you are bisexual, you are attracted to multiple genders, but you can be more attracted to certain genders than to others.

But nothing says you have to experience unequal attraction. You can be bi and experience equal attraction to both your own and other genders. This would mean you fit the definition of pan as well. You could choose to identify as bi, pan, bi/pan, queer, queer/bi, queer/pan, or even switch it up depending on the situation and all would be equally valid.
I thought bi was liking undisclosed multiple genders and pan a as liking all genders or not having a preference. Im not sure which one one I am more closely. Bi the way, there's nothing wrong with being bi. ❤️💛💚💙💜
Yeah exactly. I am bi and not pan because I am more attracted to certain genders than others. "	9i901e	NonBinary	204	1.0	2018-09-23 15:03:31

can i be nonbinary transmasc without taking surgery or hormones?	"over the last year after a lot of questioning, i've come to the conclusion that i'm nonbinary transmasc (AFAB). i actually questioned if I was FTM as a teenager for 6 months  (down to cutting my hair and dressing like a boy and watching trans youtubers) but ultimately decided that being a binary trans guy wasn't for me. i spent most of the next ten years (from 14 to 24) bouncing back to the other binary and trying to be a cis woman but ultimately not being able to do so. two years ago i started to acknowledge my queer identity and explored my gender identity. about a year ago I realized that i'm definitely nonbinary transmasc. i'd say i'm more a boy than a girl but not completely a boy.

i don't think i want to take testosterone at least not now because i'm not sure i want all the effects. and while i definitely have significant chest dysphoria (my ideal body would have a flat/flat-ish chest) for now i don't want top surgery, because i'm able to lessen my dysphoria enough through clothing. am i still valid in considering myself nonbinary transmasc without taking any medical interventions? i've started to transition in other ways (ie. wear masculine clothing, stopped shaving my legs, prefer they/them pronouns although i'm not insisting on it)."	"[removed]
You can be whoever you want to be* and you don't need others' permission 😊

_*And that might change over time_
You can absolutely be so without HRT or surgery!
 I (AMAB) have been questioning quite a bit and for awhile thought I was transfem, but ultimately landed on just enby. 

I don't think I want to start HRT and I am currently not interested in surgery, but I absolutely consider myself trans non-binary.

I think about it like this non binary isn't just option 3 (after male/female) it is options 3 to infinity. It is everything that _isn't_ male or female. So if non-binary transmasc feels right and like it describes you, then it's 100% valid and awesome!
Hormones and surgery can help you feel more comfortable in your body, if that helps you feel more comfortable in your body. But they are nit required to be Trans of any flavor.
You could always start on a low low dose of testosterone and then go from there. I have a friend who is transmasc but had to go the slow route and they’re still getting a little of a beard and whatnot just slower. If you start taking it and it feels good and natural, then ask to go up.
Thanks, everyone for these comments. I'm not OP, but am going through similar struggles (never-ending wait times for HRT, it's been 2 years now), and I felt like I wasn't valid as a transmasc person, especially after seeing so many posts about people on hormones.

It was really affirming reading all this.
I am so damn glad the answers have been overwhelmingly positive. See, I think of myself as femme-leaning trans-nonbinary lesbian, but amab and not on medication/surgery. It's just the way I feel.
Yes. You don't have to transition in any way you don't want to
Yeah. Being transgender does not require any particular type of transition if that is not something you want.
yeah, I'm transmasc/nonbinary and in the same boat. Have questioned if I'm FTM, but don't fully feel that way and am not sure any kind of medical transition is for me. Sometimes get upset that being nonbinary is really not taken seriously by many people, but I know it's real for me. Even if some people see me as just a masc cis girl - the truth is my experience of gender is outside the norm regardless of what you wanna call it and IDing as nonbinary/transmasc feels most true to me. 

Gender is self-expression and self-exploration, and everyone should be able to determine what gendered things (clothes, pronouns, identities) they align with without having to prove themselves as valid. Gender norms & standards have always been something that is enforced, and gatekeeping trans-ness is an extension of that system. Being nonbinary is, for me, about rejecting that system completely.
You don’t need permission to be who you are
You should look up Ryan Cassata, he’s trans and has had top surgery but does not take T. Good role model :)
I think it's better than taking hormones or getting any other medical interventions done at all. I know that some people feel a lot better with affirming treatments, but gender is a social construct, right?

Just be a dude with a vagina. You're still a guy.

Sometimes I'm a woman with a penis. That's not invalid. Modifying my body is something I don't feel is necessary at all. This one works pretty damn well.
Aside from taking a couple of decades longer to come to the conclusion, I'm in the same place as you but opposite - AMAB, not wanting surgery or hormones, but asserting my gender choice in feminine clothing, starting to shave legs and preferring they/them over he/him but not really caring.

I'll never be, or look, binary feminine, and I chose not to be, or look most of the time, binary masculine, so I think that's a valid definition of being between the two, siding towards female gender, so non-binary transfemme would, I guess, describe me quite well (although just ""non-binary"" is probably sufficient) - and similarly non-binary transmasc sounds a perfectly acceptable box for you to sit in if you desire for a named box :-)
Yes. Ignore people who say you need to medically transition to be trans.
You are valid regardless of where you are in your transition or if you choose not to transition at all. 

You are valid regardless of how you dress, act, or talk.

 you are valid in the closet, you're valid if you're out. 

There is no requirement, you're trans if you feel trans.
You are in charge of how you identify/express your self! Read it again!!! 🫶
Yes! For me being nonbinary is a social thing. I don't want any surgeries or hormone therapy.
Yes
You don’t need to transition to be trans. You are 100% valid, if you feel like you’re trans, you’re trans.
Yes. Do your own thing. You define your own gender! Labels aren't made to be something restrictive that you need to conform yourself to.
You are valid as you are. I’m trans masc nonbinary. No hormones, sometimes I like my chest, sometimes it’s in the way and sometimes I’m indifferent. We’re both valid trans people
You can be anything you want to be, except for a rude person lol you owe no one anything, as long as you're happy, you win
Yes. You are who you are. Gender identity has one definition, how you perceive yourself, and ONLY how you see yourself. No one else can tell you who you are or make that decision for you and there are no requirements. I know it’s messy and anxiety riddled at times but don’t over think it. Just be your favorite you 🤷🏻
Yes!
yes you can <3
Simply, yes
Yup!
Whatever you feel and whatever you present yourself as, you are valid! Even if it doesn't fit into any boxes like we're used to. You are what you call yourself and nobody can change that.
Of course you can. I am
YES. BYE.
yep
you are just as trans as someone who does medically transition. i'm nonbinary transmasc and i'm on a SUUUPER low dose of T because i'm terrified of growing a beard. i'm still trans, and so are you :)
Trans and nonbinary are umbrella terms! You can use as you wish, as long as you identify different than your assigned gender at birth and don't fall within the ""binary"" of male vs female! Technically all nonbinary people are trans(I think / afaik) and you can identify however vague or precise as you like!
explaining isn't needed. it's always going to be yes
Yes.
What way you express yourself or identify yourself is yours. But if you feel unconfident about it I know this other non-binary whom is transfem.... They are more girly than the girls we all know. And as it stands they don't take any meds and just do that with clothes.
We need a bot that just responds to every post beginning with ""can i be non-binary if..."" with ""yes""
you can be whatever you want to be there are no rules except the ones you make for yourself
you are valid, you are you and only you can say who you are <3
is it okay to call myself trans? i definitely don't feel cis.
I reallyyyyyy vibe with your avatar and username lol
If it’s social what is the difference between non-binary and gnc?
are you going to take T for a predetermined time and then stop or cycle on/off? or just feel it out and see how it goes?
[removed]
Trans doesn't mean ""transitioned"". It means across, different from.

Most trans people transition either socially or medically in some way. But even if you don't transition at all, being nonbinary means you're ""across"" from the gender you were assigned at birth — you weren't assigned to be nonbinary at birth after all!
Definitely, yes!
Absolutely you can.
Trans included everyone who does not identify with their gender assigned at birth, so obviously including nonbinary people.

But I do get the feeling, cuz when cis people say trans they usually mean binary trans people (usually only those who fully transition sadly), so oftentimes I also feel like I don't fit into that description of trans, that cis ppl have started to understand and use.
I don't get complements all too often. And I've had this one pop into my head randomly at least once a day all week.

So, thank you.

ଘ(੭ºัᴗºั)━☆ﾟ*:.
Idk for me at least, I definitely have gender dysphoria even though I don't want (right now) hormones and surgery. Also, I feel nonbinary even if I'm wearing a dress or naked lol. I've never felt like a woman regardless of what I'm wearing or how I'm presenting. And I don't quite feel like a man either (though I think that feels more aligned than being a woman).

So socially transitioning (ie. clothing, pronouns, not shaving etc) helps lessen dysphoria and makes my gender presentation more aligned with my gender identity.  Hormones and surgery can also do that, but for now I don't know if it's necessary for me. Maybe down the road that'll change.
I don't know, I'm still discovering my identity and some of those terms are pretty new to me. For the most of my life I lived as gay intersex male, being nonbinary is recent and I'm sorry if I say something wrong or confusing about it.
my plan rn is to feel it out. since i’m on such a low dose changes will come slowly so ill have time to adjust to whatever does happen
thank you guys, this thread was extremely affirming!
Ah, so the way you've decided to transition is what's social then, not your identity. That makes sense.
That's ok. I just think it's really important (for everyone) to know that social roles and presentation are a very different thing from gender itself. Trans people can be GNC too, but it wouldn't make them cis, you know? They're completely separate, like orientation.
I know. I can speak just from my point of view, I'm not trying to make an assumption about the whole community. I have that problem that I'm not trans and cis either so it's hard for me to fit in some spaces.

💛🤍💜🖤	"Hope I don't offend anyone with this post! I don't know I'd go as far as to call myself an enby (genderfluid fits me much better). But from what I understand, non-binary can be both an identity into itself, and an umbrella term for any gender identity that falls between the two binaries. Under that definition I think I'd qualify as within the non-binary umbrella:)

If i ever decide to wear any gender identity stuff at Pride tho, i think I'd have to go for the enby flag! It's soooo cool-looking! Idk, the genderfluid flag doesn't really do much for me 🤷

If I'm wrong in my understanding, please please educate me 💜"	"Gender fluid is for sure under the nonbinary umbrella and you are more than welcome to use the flag and/or refer to yourself as an enby ☺️
Id as enby cause it's easier to explain then agender
First, non-binary means to be something that doesn't neatly fit into the gender binary, which includes gender fluid. So you're totally ok to use non-binary as a general term for yourself.

Second, mood. The non-binary flag is soooo cool. I'm triple queer and the non-binary flag is probably my favorite flag out of all three.
Id as enby because nonbinary bisexual makes me laugh.
Identifying as enby when you’re actually genderfluid because you’re just confused™️ and it’s easier to explain to people than to just constantly be questioning how you feel every day
It's under enby so you're good either way :)
I identify as non-binary because I'm genderfluid. Neither end of the range my gender stays within is binary. By definition I'm expressing and experiencing a non-binary gender every single day, just not always the same one.
I much prefer pink to yellow. I think we can work out a trade.
You are welcome here ❤️
Upvote 4 you too our kind enby idk i just want to play need for speed heat
The fact it’s got black and purple and a lot of us are goth. Jusssssss feels right
Identifying as pansexual = woke. The pansexual flag = broke. It's like having neon lights shone in your eyes. We need a nice soft pastel-tone flag please, some of us have autism and need soft gentle colours 😖
As a gender fluid person, I also prefer the enby flag. I just don’t like the gender fluid flags colors.
I used to use genderqueer but the flag is 🤢 so I switched to nonbinary.
Thanks for this, for some weird reason it made me really happy !
same here. like i’m genderless/agender but legally i’m nonbinary
Same but with bigender
Same but with girlflux
For me it's easier to explain and less of a mouthful than saying I'm a transmasc demi-boy
Agreed. I'm totes agender but I like the nb flag and saying nb
Fuck I'm bisexual too.. hadn't even considered this. What does it MEAN?
It means everyone is fair game and anyone into me is at least a little queer.
Everyone?! Even my biphobic abusive shrew of an ex girlfriend? 😯
It gets really fun when you've got two non-binary genderfluid people with different presentations for their range of genders. My genderfluid partner gets both more masc and more femme than I do, but usually we pick opposite directions for outings in less friendly spaces. I think them in a tank top and jorts leading me around in a skirt is adorable, but I also love when nobody wears the pants.
Well okay. I should have said every gender. Not like I don’t have standards.
No no you misunderstood me! I mean if my hateful ex was attracted to me, and I'm enby, that makes her a little bit queer???

Anybody else newly discovered they're NB? I'm having a pretty shitty time right now but I feel so good about my gender identity it brings me a spark of joy when I think about it		"I figured it out super recently too! It feels very good
My partner is NB and I’m... still figuring out what the heck I am. I’m somewhere between genderfluid and trans, but super terrified by all the negative aspects about being trans. GF lets me turn my femme on and off when I want to. 

But enough about me. You are valid and true and amazing, even during shitty days. Seeing you fills me with hope that I will someday have myself figured out and be truly happy about it. So thank you, my joy. 💜
It’s good to discover yourself. ❤️ I’m so happy that you found that much more about yourself.
I remember when I figured it out- it simultaneously felt super awesome, but also difficult because I didn't feel valid. But that came with time and meeting other NB people.
Hooray! It's such a freeing feeling! 
I'm still not super certain but I've been feeling it out as a fit for me, and it feels pretty nice.
I feel the exact same way. It’s been v tough for me as a femme person who feels invalidated by the fact that they look like a girl and have a vagina bc it’s like why can’t i just be a girl? But I’m me and I’m starting to get better at accepting it. 
I think I figured it out like 2 days ago. It felt right. But also oh god oh god oh god I’m 36 and married oh god oh god oh god. Just delving into the world now. 
Having the freedom to figure yourself out is so wonderful, I hope you find yourself soon 💖
Yesss! Being NB doesn't mean you don't want to be your gender assigned at birth. I'd love to be a girl sometimes 😂 it'd make my life so much easier Haha!
I have a night out coming up and I tried on all my dresses and thought ""no, these are for girls""

I'm stumped 🤣

i’m 27, and have been with my lesbian identified partner for 4 years. i have been on testosterone for over a year and had top surgery. i use he and they pronouns. strangers think i am a man. 

and yet, we are both still lesbians! we  are both still attracted to each other and very much feel this is a lesbian relationship. 

i just want everyone to know you have permission to define your life and relationships in whatever way makes you feel good. your body and your identity are yours. 💖"	"yesss beautiful 👏🏼👏🏼 you validate your experience and decide how to live your life!

Thank you for this! As another non-binary lesbian who has been considering HRT and/or top surgery, it's comforting to know that there are other lesbians out there who are in a similar position and still in relationships!
I love this so much 💖
I'm so happy for you!!! I legit went off T even tho it made me feel amazing because I was so scared wlw would never find me attractive if I was on it too long :(
If you go by He and They do you consider yourself feminine/female?
of course! if there’s people out there who think like we do then there are also people out there who think like we do who will love us and see us for who we are :)
i’m glad i posted then! feel free to ask any follow up questions. i didn’t magically arrive at this wonderful point of my life and did a lot of soul searching to get here :)
aw i’m glad :)
oh no :( i’m sorry you felt you had to make that choice. i hope you feel permission to go back on T if that’s what you want 💘

can't speak for OP, but pronouns and gender identity are not the same thing. for example, an agender person may choose a gendered pronoun like he or she. historically, he/him lesbians have been around since lesbians.
nope! i consider myself a non-binary lesbian.
Then colour me confused about the definition of lesbian.
Some lesbians define their orientation as, “people who aren’t men attracted to other people who aren’t men”. So that includes women, and nonbinary people who don’t identify as partly male. 

Presentation doesn’t equal gender, but gender-nonconforming and nonbinary people may use traditionally gendered things to express themselves. 

English pronouns are really, really strongly gendered, but that doesn’t mean we can’t also use them to express ourselves like we do with our appearance. Some masculine people who aren’t men may be able to pass as one, but nobody would say they can’t still be lesbians (nobody sensible anyway). 

Some lesbians also feel that not being attracted to men influences how they think about their own gender identity. Being attracted to men is one of the primary gender roles for women, so it is easy to feel a disconnect from your assigned gender if you aren’t. They may also feel that their main or only connection to womanhood is their attraction to women and non-men, so their experience of gender doesn’t feel like a traditional binary experience.
thank you for taking the time to write this out 💖
>Some lesbians define their orientation as, “people who aren’t men attracted to other people who aren’t men”. So that includes women, and nonbinary people who don’t identify as partly male.

Okay, but that doesn't include reference back to the gender of the individual. Does the individual need to be female/feminine in some capacity to be a Lesbian? Or can a trans-man, Masc NB, or cis man claim to be a lesbian?

Is lesbianism about women loving women, or is it about non-men loving other non-men? I was hoping for clarity but it just gets more grey as people chime in.
clarity is not always the goal for myself or for some members of my community. our society, our language, our gender stereotypes and more are all very complex and inherently not clear or aiming for clarity. so much of gender and sexuality is about nuanced real lived experiences, not clarity and concrete definitions. i have been identifying as a lesbian for 15 years. it’s who i am. it’s my community. it’s my lens for seeing the world. and my medical transition, new pronouns, and sense of non-binary self didn’t change that.
Trans and cis men are men, so no, they can't be lesbians per either definition of lesbianism. And I would say it does reference their gender, either as ""I am a woman"", or ""I am explicitly not a man"" - for some people, that distinction is more important. Also, some nonbinary people may identify as partly woman as well!

It's difficult to say what lesbianism is ""about"", because you're probably going to get a different definition from every lesbian you ask. For some, it's being a woman who loves other women, for some, it's rejecting the idea that they should be attracted to men, and for some it's a complicated issue that's also tied into their own gender identity. 

The word lesbian was made before the existence of nonbinary people was widely known and before the label nonbinary existed as we know it today.  Historically, people who might be nonbinary now might have identified as butch, stone butch, drag kings or queens, transvestites, or other terms. They may also have identified as being gay or lesbian, so I don't think it's unreasonable to include what we now call nonbinary people under these labels too. 

(Lesbian also used to describe both gay and bi women, but that's a whole other conversation). 

There is a tendency to treat nonbinary people as a single, uniform category, usually as androgynous and genderless or as both male and female. We are also often reduced to how masculine or feminine we are, and counted as being ""basically men"" or ""basically women"" for the purposes of orientation. 

However, for any person of any orientation, there may be a nonbinary person out there they could be attracted to, because we are a very diverse group. Likewise, we may use those labels because it's an easier way of describing our attraction than giving a Gender 101 lecture every time we meet someone or put ourselves out there. 

Hope this helps! As a nonbinary person who sits at the intersection of various identities, it's something I think about a lot."	hq66g2	NonBinary	195	0.98	2020-07-13 01:24:10
Hi I’m Eli and this is my gender identity journey! (so far)		"WHERE DID THE SOCKS GO
Also: amazing comic!!!
I love this comic; I can relate to it so much. Unfortunately, it's taken me until my 30s to recognize my gender identity, but better late than never, right? :D
Yessss the undercut in the future. It must happen.
I love this!
dam, wish I could go back to that childhood mentality
I’m 41, can’ came out about 1 month ago and I think it’s never too late! I’m sooo much more happy and confident in who I am now. Message me anytime!
to be fair, i'm in my 20s right now haha
yeah I'm turning 20 this summer as well xD"	lr3wuw	NonBinary	190	1.0	2021-02-24 04:42:48
I say this in the most polite way possible:	"If someone is *intentionally*  refusing to acknowledge your identity, ***THEY ARE NOT YOUR FRIEND.***

You can try and educate them, even try a few times, but if someone is continuously being willfully ignorant. ***JUST F#CKING LEAVE THEM BEHIND***

Show yourself some basic self respect and remove toxic people from your life. You don't have to deal with people. You can make new or better friends anyway, and even having no friends is better than having shit ""friends"""	"Aye aye, I second this for sure.

It can hurt, sure. It most probably will. But having this hurt is better than having the same over and over again, every day, with no end in sight.
I can't upvote this enough. 

It's heartbreaking to see all these posts about ""my friends"" or ""my parent"" misgenders me.... you dont need em! Move on. For every person in your life refusing to acknowledge your name and pronouns there's AT LEAST one person out there that you dont know yet, that will.
Yep, as soon as I’m stable, I’m going no contact with my family
Amen!
Well lucky for me I don't really have friends
But none of them can house me :(
Then put yourself in a position to house yourself. Cant live alone? Mkve somewhere that has communal households (west coast has plenty). Minor? Cool, you'll be 18 one day, be ready. No matter what the reason, you can make steps now to prepare you to leave these terrible people because YOU DESERVE BETTER. you are a human being deserving of love and respect because your name/pronouns/identity are NOT too much to ask.
Getting kicked out of a communal house as i write this.

Is it really better to live in poverty, to eat poorly and not be sure where I'm living next month?

Don't I deserve better than this?
They weren't saying ""go be homeless"" they were talking about preparing to move elsewhere... *Away from the people who are assholes to you...*
I'm currently underhoused, and planning on moving back in to my parents place

At this point in life, I don't have any options of living in places where people aren't assholes to me, I can't afford it.
No-one is saying ""just move lol"" as if you have unlimited funding, we're talking about preparing to move, stuff like saving up for rent, researching where would be most budget conscious in areas that are more widely accepting? Finding local queer communities may also be helpful to find others in similar situations who could rent with you as a group. Maybe even apply to unis to do stuff you like so that you can meet like-minded people and use student loan to start renting. Use uni to develop skills and a portfolio for what you want to do, then use that to get work during and after uni.
Hi friend, I appreciate your concern, and for trying to help. All of my options, which don't involve my parents, involve abject poverty.

I have multiple advanced degrees from university, and I can't find work.

I am choosing to move to somewhere which is not gender affirming, and choosing to detransition and deadname myself for the job search, because while they can't fire me for transitioning after I find a job, nobody seems to be interested in hiring the me I can put out while scraping by.

It is tough to do interviews when you're not eating well, and you aren't sure if you can justify spending money on professional clothes. It's tough to focus on applying for jobs when I have to spend hours connecting with local queers to try to convince a landlord I'm not a risk to rent to.

I can't do it alone, I have been trying for many months, but it is too hard, and I'm not making progress."	zxk18r	NonBinary	188	1.0	2022-12-28 20:28:47

Why I am now a swamp	So me and my mun were talking last night about the theology of being non binary, there's a verse that says 'male and female he created them' which some use to argue that non binary doesn't exist. Other refute this because in the same passage it says 'he created the land and the sea' but you get things like marsh land or swaps that aren't fully land or sea so it makes sense for their to be genders besides male and female. When I told my mum all this she laughed and said 'so you're a swamp?' cue the two of us laughing about this for the next half hour about my new gender identity as a 'swamp thing'	"If he created them male *and* female (rather than male *or* female), then isn't bigender the default gender identity?
More of this wholesomeness and queer theology pls! <3 Glad you have a cool supportive mom, Swamp Person! :)

Thank you for this post I love this 😂
There's a movie called swamp thing btw, my brother used to watch it loads when I was little and you just reminded me of it! To be fair though all I remember is the swamp thing (it was some guy who got mutated into a plant monster) grew a flower on his foot for some woman, and there was a scene where two people were having a fight via badass scar comparisons
I love this! I’m not christen but i know a good bit of scripture and I love it when people use it to support an idea that others have used scripture to invalidate.
You could also be a frog! I’ve heard that same argument before, but with animals of the land and water and then amphibians being the exception.
Hi, I'm Eadwyn, I'm swamp

omg. i say that im a swamp creature like almost daily so i'm extremely happy to hear i'm right 😂 thanks friend lol

I am a swamp. kinda
If it helps, most theologians and historians agree that Genesis is myth and poetry meant for theological/spiritual truth and not really so focused on science and history (in fact I think the two creation stories, the 7 days and the Adam Eve ones, were written by different, separate cultures btw). And I'm telling you this as a devout Catholic. So go be the swamp you've always wanted to be, and when people get up in your face, just tell them to ""get out of mah swamp!""

Non-binary parents and non-binary baby	I’m a proud nb parent with an nb partner and a baby who we’ve never gendered. They wear whatever clothes because they’re cute, be it neutrals, pink flowers, blue dinos, bows, gnome hats, whatever in between. We’re planning to use they/them for them until they can talk, recalibrate from there, and maintain an open conversation about gender identity. Just wanted fellow nbs to know we’re out here :)	"Hello fellow queer parent! I'm NB, and my partners are a trans man and trans woman. We parent together and have a gender-neutral little one! 

I just wanted to say hello because I know how lonely it can be; most parenting spaces are super heavily gendered, and I'm so tired of being seen as a mother just because I'm the birthing parent.
Yoooo, this is so cool! Nice 👌🏻
Me (nb) and my wife (binary trans woman) are planning to do this. We both would have appreciated it so much why not give our child that opportunity? 

Even though they will most likely be cis its still healthier for the kid.
That's awesome! it's gonna get tougher once they go to school but I believe you would know what to do when such time comes. It would be good to get them a play-buddy when their old enough, that way you get more experienced on how to explain things and communicate with them on how they can be who they want to be even if their friends may seem way different. :D
[deleted]
I have never though on using neutral pronouns for a baby 🤔 that's not a bad idea
❤️❤️❤️ non-binary parent here too :) we were lucky enough to find a daycare that uses they/them for all the babies. We use he/they but keep their wardrobe non gendered and hella colorful. We also like to change all the pronouns when we read them books. One thing I'm curious about is what other parents go by. It felt like a big decision for me to pick my parental title and I haven't met any other nb parents. So happy to see your post!!!
YES! This is definitely how I am going to parent my child/children :)
Would love to do this if I have a baby! Awesome job you’re both doing!!
🥰🥰🥰
Hello hello!! I was also pregnant!! It was a wild ride and I’m also breastfeeding. Solidarity friend
And I love that your kid(s) could have experiences of themselves and others with a broader viewpoint of gender!
Same. Shame I'm aroace, I'll just marry my bestie and we'll adopt or something 😂
I absolutely LOVE the concept!! Let the kiddo tell us when they know & want to ;-)
I like Ren, short for parent. I’m leaning towards Momo, it’s cute and neutral and nods at Mom without feeling too gendered. It’s also Japanese for peach 🍑✨
OMG SAME. Am ace enby, would marry bestie for all of the emotional, social, and financial benefits. :-)"	qyxrkb	NonBinary	183	0.98	2021-11-21 15:52:27
Ive had to remind myself often that gender expression doesn’t equal gender identity, and that I’m valid regardless of how I present. They/them		"Wow, you look incredible!
Woah! You look fabulous and your hair is so cool!
You look so ethereal! I love it :3
I'm still trying to get to that point myself... I'm proud of you for being confident in your gender expression and identity!

Am I losing my queer status?	Hi all, I have a question. I have identified as a lesbian for a long time. But I am getting more and more masculine. For a while my identity as a non binary person attracted to women worked fine for me. Now I am in doubt I might be a trans man. I am scared that I lose my queer status which I love so much if I am a trans man. The thought of being in a straight relationship feels like a step back. Have any of you had similar feelings? Maybe my love for the queer community is just to big. I don't know! It is the first place I felt at home. Am I making things to big?	"In my honest opinion I think you can still identify as queer if you're a trans man, but I'm not a native English speaker. In my mind any relationship that includes a non-straight or non-cis element is a queer relationship. Even a seemingly straight relationship can be queer, E.g. if one (or more) are bi or trans. But I am not sure if this is just how I interpret things... I think queer is a broad umbrella.
Trans people are still queer love. Even binary ones. Realizing you’re a trans man doesn’t make you not queer or less queer.
You're still queer! Being trans is itself a unique experience, and you're not losing any status - straight trans people are as valid as any other trans people (and, of course, still part of the LGB**T**Q+ community!)
you can still call yourself queer, if that’s something you feel you need to feel happy and comfortable. you dont have to date men or state any attraction to them, you can stay dating women only. no one can invalidate your choice in labels, so do what feels most comfy to you
Same bro. Started out a masculine lesbian, came out as enby and started T, upped my T dose and decided to transition all of the way. But being trans comes with TONS more discrimination and hate than just being lesbian, in my experience. That makes it an innately MORE queer experience for me. I’m suffering much more for my identity than I did before. Those who accepted my lesbianism, don’t accept my trans identity. I’ve had to lose friends and family, that didn’t happen when I was “just” lesbian.

Those experiences make it feel innately more queer.
 Queer is an umbrella term under which trans people fall. And being in a “straight” relationship doesn’t necessarily mean you aren’t queer anyway. 

*ahem* Jamie Raines *ahem*

You’re still queer. 💙💗🤍💗💙
Queer is a self-identification. I have a friend who's a trans guy, and he considers himself just a straight guy. He honestly doesn't really consider himself part of the LGBT community, which I think may partially stem from some internalized homophobia/misogyny, but that doesn't invalidate him not identifying as queer. And as a trans women, I get it. I don't want to be trans, I just want to be a woman. There may be a time when I no longer want to be visible as trans because if everything that carries with it. For now, during transition, my visibility matters more than someday when no one would know. There's a lot of long-transitioned men and women out there advocating for us, but that can sometimes cause people to not understand what transition looks like, and how long it takes.
I completely get what you mean, as I am struggling with the exact same thing right now. 

It’s a big part of why I like the term genderqueer, as it feels like it’s a way to encapsulate more of my overall identity. I spent the first 40 years of my life socialized as female. I’ve spent the last 25 years identifying as a lesbian. Those things are still part of me, even as my identity and my gender alignment are in major flux. No matter how masculine I land in the end, it feels like revisionist history (for me) to ignore everything that was part of my life up to this point. And in my mind, that’s why I like genderqueer because it feels like it’s throwing a huge net over the intersection of gender and sexuality and gives me room to both identify more masculine and also embrace and honor everything I have been and still have inside me.
Check out Cyrus Grace Dunham - he's transmasculine and still calls himself a lesbian (or did last I knew). You're not alone and you're totally valid to call yourself queer or whatever else fits for you. <3
Hey. You choose. You decide if you want to identify as queer. Being a trans man doesn’t make you not queer, unless that’s what you want! Some people just want to be a straight trans man and some people want to be a queer trans man. Both are totally fine.
Yeah echoing what a lot of people have already said but in my use queer is just a catch-all term for non-straight and/or non-cis. So yes you’d still be queer
I consider myself nonbinary transmasc afab - definitely under the queer status.  I do not feel fully trans man or woman and have never been.  If I didn't have those terms then probably the closest would be a masc lesbian that is pansexual.  


We can experience a lot of cognitive dissonance so be gentle with yourself.  You also do not have to plant a flag in one thing or one thing right now.
LGB**T**
So in being trans, you would still be considered queer. But just keep in mind that allies are also apart of our community!

What's in your pants doesn't make who you are, nor does your sexual identity/orientation. It's what's in your *HEAD* and in your *HEART* that make up who you are. Please don't base your entire identity soley on being queer, that's just silly. You have many other traits that make you the wonderful human being you are! 🫂

You would never be kicked out of the LGBT+ community for self discovery, and anyone who would try to isn't worth your time. 💙
You're as queer as you want to be 😊
It's LGBT+, not LGB. You understand first hand the struggles of not being cis and/or heterosexual/romantic. You have experience as someone who is or possibly formerly lesbian and NB. If you transition to a straight trans man, you'll have the experiences as a trans person from then on

If anyone tells you otherwise, ignore them!
Het passing does not mean straight
Man if you're queer your queer no worries. I say I'm queer but I can brake that down to being non-binary, gender queer/gender fluid demi boy/agender I'm also pansexual 

To top it off my boyfriend is a cis/het guy. 

He knows full well what I am and my queerness and it works for us. 

Imo if you fall somewhere outside of being cisgender, heterosexual, heteroromantic and queer feels right then it's right.
I say it all depends on how you identify yourself.  If you still feel queer then you are 🥰
You could be a masculine non binary. But even then like others have said, trans people are still queer love. So even if you are a trans man, you aren’t any less apart of the queer community.
in my book, queer just means anyone who’s not allo/cis/het, idk if this is the same for anyone else
Trans folks are as much a part of the queer community as they want to be.
Trans is queer no matter what, friend. You're good.
I personally am still unsure of my gender, but still identify as a lesbian/gay/queer pretty interchangeably as an AFAB person but I think anyone who tries to make you feel like you don’t have the right to claim that identity needs to mind their own business. Being queer looks like SO many things and that experience you just explained is 100% LGBTQIA+. But if you identified as a straight man then that is cool, literally whatever makes the most sense to you because it’s your life. The term queer is lovely because it can encapsulate so many different things. Please keep in mind that there are gonna be some shitty people but there are plenty more who will support you!! Take whatever label feels right to you and roll with it. :)
if you identify as both queer and a trans man, that's nobody's business but your own. we give power to words, and language is use.

you know yourself better than anyone and if inside you feel queer, then call yourself queer!
For me, being queer is directly tied to the concept of neurodiversity. As such, it's multidimensional and does not have hard boundaries. If the way you understand and experience your existence deviates from the typical, you are queer by definition! And if your mind has come to understand a more expansive view of the human experience, well... there is no membership to revoke and no authority who can take that away from you, although there will always be people who will try to claim that right.
Def still queer! BUT one thing I struggle with is that even as a MASC queer person, you still need to keep in mind how you impact specifically ""lesbian "" spaces. As a NB person it's acceptable to be in feminine centered spaces but the more masculine a person gets the less they may fit in certain spaces they used to. (You may already not feel quite right in those spaces so maybe it doesn't matter, just something to keep in mind and weigh out.)

 Also one thing I keep hearing/seeing is people dating might have a certain image of themself and if you change your appearance it might affect how they see themself. Ie: a masc person dating a femme queer who might struggle with being automatically identified as straight in queer spaces. People look at you differently and it's a struggle for you both. V.v 

I only bring these up because it's thoughts I struggle with and I've seen others struggle with these aspects AFTER the fact without realizing this would happen. Everyone reacts differently but since you mentioned being afraid of loosing your queer community I thought I'd bring it up. I travel in a lot of femme centered spaces so it's a thing for me, but if your queer spaces are already very mixed with masc folx then no worries! Hope this comes off as a thought exercise and not too negative. :)
I'm just curious why you think being straight would be a step back? Do you think maybe you have some internal bias against straight people or relationships?
You are not but also these feelings are valid! I’m scared of this too 💛
I mean it’s just a label, you like who you like. 🤷‍♂️
So interesting a lot of people love the term queer so much. Maybe it’s just my own background but if someone called me queer I would be very upset, it produces a very negative knee jerk reaction from me but I guess I’ve only ever been called it in an aggressive or unfriendly tone
You can call yourself queer. You belong with us if you choose to ID as queer
Makes total sense! Thanks. I am not a native English speaker either. I think it is a broad term too. In my head I just see a straight couple but Obviously I am not cis. So you are absolutely right.
I think that way as well, especially because of aro or ace relationships. They can be sometimes difficult to explain, so if you're bad with labels, queer can be good
Thanks! Yeah you are right. I might not be a lesbian anymore but still queer 🏳️‍🌈
Only if you’d like that label though. I’m a bi trans man but I’ve never ‘clicked’ with the label queer, somehow.
Yes! I needed to hear this thanks! 🙌
So Sorry to hear that! People can be so harsh. So far I haven't had any bad experience. Except some weird and maybe a bit inappropriate questions. But I have only told the people I trust the most. I am kinda scared to tell everyone else. 
Big hug for you! I hope you have found new more loving people in your life <3
Yes, I completely understand. Thank you for sharing your experience. I love the term genderqueer as well.  It feels so inclusive. I also still feel a connection with the female part of me since I have spend most of my live identifying as female. It is hard to describe. I don't want to ignore any part of me. But It is just a feeling of pride I guess. I don't want te present feminine in any way and would like people seeing me as a man more and more. I am still not sure if I am fully trans man just that I am so much more happy presenting masculine. And I have some gender dysphoria. I will see where the road takes me.
Thanks! I will check him out :)
That is how I am feeling as well. I don't identify fully with either. I feel like I am some kind of mix. Somewhere in the middle but more on the masc side. I have used different labels over the years, lesbian, genderqueer, butch, non binary. Nothing fits perfectly but they all have parts that I identify with. 
I might borrow non binary transmasc for a while! It feels like a better fit than trans man for now. Thanks!
Yes, thank you for sharing. I see now from all these awesome replies here that I am definitely queer. That makes me happy 😊. I am a mixture of all kinds of labels. No need to stop identifying with them when I present and feel more masculine.
Yeah, I know what you mean. There are some places where I would feel uncomfortable being to masculine. Although I am getting more and more comfortable being me so it is a trade off I guess. Luckily I hang out with a lot of trans and non binary people as well. They get the struggles.
Not at all. It might be because when I was still in the closet and in a straight relationship I was very unhappy en anxious. 
The queer community just gave me so much happiness and acceptance. It feels like home. 
So maybe just a bad memorie or experience.  Internal straightfobia is that a thing now? :p
I get it. It was used in a negative in the past for me too. That is why I like to use it in a positive way. It takes the negative power away. Now I like it. Also making it positive feels a bit like an F U to all the people who tried to be hurtful.
omg our little dudes match.

with love from a transmasc 💕
yeah to elaborate, even a straight binary trans person is still queer! you're queer if you're not cis *and* heterosexual
also fyi he/him lesbians do exist, it's ur choice whether you think the label still fits but. it's an option !
For sure. OP is concerned about not being queer  enough though so they clearly ID that way.
good luck with your journey!!
Yes!!! Labels can be very helpful but not when they make you feel like you can’t be who you are. Do what works for you, you will always be part of the club and I wish you the best!! :)
I think in the queer community, and particularly trans people, honestly yes I think there is straight phobia. I think it's more motivated by trauma rather than hate, but people need to take as much control of their trauma as possible and not believe they are fully victim to it.
Haha nice!!
No. Not everyone experiences these things the same way, especially with gender.

I am a straight man, although I am trans. My girlfriend is straight, and is dating a straight man, and our love is not queer. I am not queer. 
This statement is on par with saying that people who date trans people are always pan.
that's not the same thing. queer is literally a broad term referring to anyone who is not cis and/or not het. you don't have to call yourself queer but it is the LGBTQ community and the T stands on its own regardless of the trans person's sexuality.
This is a pretty weird take tbh. Queer is a label. If someone doesn't think it fits them and doesn't want to wear it, you can't make them. Saying basically ""you don't have to call yourself queer but according to me you are queer anyway bc you're trans"" takes away this guy's agency to define himself and is pretty rude
They wrote 
""...you don't have to call yourself queer...""  and added that trans is an inherent part of the queer diaspora. I agree with both points.

Of course we can all define ourselves as per what suits us individually, while the umbrella terms apply to the collective and to individuals who wish to use them as such. 

I'm a bisexual, cis afab in a relationship with a cis het man. I'm queer and i'm represented by the LGBT+ umbrella as are trans of any gender and orientation.
that's not what i said. i'm saying that it can still apply to straight trans people in general (not this guy specifically) because it seemed like he was saying there's something inherently wrong with calling a straight trans person queer.

edited for clarity
""I'm queer and I'm represented by the LGBT+ umbrella"" - that's great! I'm genuinely glad you feel well represented by this umbrella; as a bisexual person myself I know how the B is often overlooked :/ Everyone should be able to find community somewhere.

""...as are trans [people] of any gender and orientation."" - this is not great, as now you're talking about how a large swath of other people feel, not yourself. Some trans people, especially those who are straight and/or stealth, do not feel well represented by this umbrella, and do not find community there. It is important for cis people to understand this. Just because something is an umbrella does not mean you should assume that everyone who COULD be under that umbrella IS comfortable being put there by default. 

The answer to the OP question of ""am I still queer"" is more along the lines of ""yes, if that's comfortable for you and where you find community,"" rather than ""yes, because technically you and everyone like you still count bc blah blah""...there's no ""queer test"" or application. If it works for you, wear it! If it doesn't, don't! But these are decisions you make for yourself; you shouldn't make them for others, nor should others make them for you.
I think he and I are both saying you should let people tell you whether they consider themselves queer or not, rather than assuming they must be fine with being called queer just because they're trans
I did not say at any point that it is inherently wrong to call a straight trans person queer.   I said that not everyone has the same experience with gender as you, and not all straight trans men are queer. You can’t apply that label to someone else, they are the only one who can determine what to call thier identity
What do you think the T stands for?
well his example of people being transphobic when they say people who date trans people are all pan kind of suggested more than that
Ok, pardon me for trying to have a discussion in good faith. As a trans person, I do in fact know what the T stands for, you can hold the snark. I just think it's short-sighted (and at times, dangerous) to not understand that not everyone feels exactly how you've decided they should feel. Please just let people be people. Have a great day!
Suggests more to that? I don’t see what you’re trying to read between the lines. 

Basically what I was saying there is that this is similar because you can’t just say any trans persons partner is not straight because they’re dating someone who is trans. Lots of people claim that dating a trans person makes you pan. They’re saying that dating a trans person even if you are both straight means that you are not straight, because they are trans. Dating a trans person is not always queer love
? He just said it's not good/accurate to assume people who date trans people are all pan. Similarly, it's not good to assume trans people all ID as queer. The point is to let people tell you who they are, rather than assuming you know who they are.


>you've decided they should feel


I know that i didnt decide how anyone should feel though. I didnt tell anyone how they should feel, simply that the 

T reps trans people just as the other letters rep others. 

we make our own choices anyway and i have no interest at all in telling anyone else how they should or shouldnt id.
yeah and that's a transphobic thing to do. it is always wrong to say that. it's not always wrong to include straight trans people as part of the queer community. that's why i don't think these examples are that similar.
that makes sense. that just wasn't the way i interpreted it"	qg57bc	NonBinary	173	0.97	2021-10-26 12:21:51
Got out of a bad relationship and embraced my agender identity this march! Been growing my hair out since, feeling more like me every day.		"You have great hair!
The Amazing Agender!!!!

Congrats!!!!!!!!!
AN ANGEEELLLLLL 
Hey, great job on leaving the bad relationship, and damn you look great!
You’re adorable! Is that a nose piercing? If so it looks good! If it’s just my mind tricking me then I encourage you to get some cute piercings lol
you look great! I imagine you would look good with long hair if that's the route you're going towards :D
is it thank you!! I plan on getting a few more this fall when I can afford them C:
Yay awesome. "	8whbha	NonBinary	168	1.0	2018-07-06 04:54:16
Gender Expression Vs Gender Identity: my gender expression is fluid and it leans feminine a lot of the time. It's hard to hear things like I look better when I 'make an effort' (present feminine), and I worry people will think I'm just a cis girl wanting to be special when I have genuine dysphoria		"I'd love to have a flat chest and be read as non binary, I feel more like myself when I present less femininely. But I know no one will ever look at me and use they/them pronouns no matter now short my hair is or how masculine I present, so I still like to wear feminine things and do my makeup more femininely because I love fashion. I wish people would take non binary people more seriously no matter how they present.
All of your looks are fantastic, and you are always YOU regardless of what arbitrarily gendered fabric you decide to put on your body. 

In the words of Eddie Izzard (stand up comedian who last I checked uses he/him pronouns and is well known for wearing dresses and makeup and other feminine coded things), ""They're not women's dresses. They're MY dresses. I bought them.""
Your andro looks are dope!! Love the top left one especially.
Im in the same boat. Plus I love makeup and skirts. I am more often than not a man, and I have a male name. People don't care shit for your pronouns or identity though, even when I ""try to pass as male"" I don't and people bend over backwards to use as many girly words to describe me as possible. I hate people.
Hey, you're cute as fuck. Present how you want. You don't owe androgyny to anyone
I feel you on this one!
This can be so frustrating. At the end of the day though we know who we are.
Don't let assholes get you down. You are putting in effort towards your true self. People who mind don't matter, and people who matter don't mind.
I'm in a similar place. By all appearances I'm very masculine and I worry people won't take me seriously when I tell them I don't identify with a binary.
Literally same
[removed]
true words. I also love your looks and wanted to tell you that you're valid, no matter what people tell you otherwise.
Thank you so much :)) that was nice to hear. I've been avoiding looking feminine lately. I think I'd feel a lot better wearing my more feminine clothes if I had a flat chest, it's such a pain when I have nice tops but if I wear them it's like b00bs eW
Tysm! I'm glad you can tell the difference actually. That's me in my 'natural form' as to speak haha
I feel you 😩 'yes GiRL'. Even when you try to explain it's useless a lot of the time. When I told my friends the name I'm going by now one of them asked could they keep my name saved as my old one until they got used to it, she was trying but I hate the thought of people having me in their contacts as my birth name. Eugh.
Aw thank you :') and you're right!
Lol what. If you mean my facial expression I just don't smile in pictures ma dude
Hope you can find people that vibe with your true self. I’m going through an incredibly similar process and if you can find other nb or nb leaning people, you’ll likely find yourself to be much more accepted and appreciated. Cuz authentic you, whatever that is, is WAY more interesting than following whatever template society’s set up.
I was literally referred to as Little Miss Konrad by a well meaning idiot not too long ago.
I'm 30.
Eugh. I feel bad for you. I think some people just need educating about it but it sucks for us. Before I started questioning my gender, in my friendship group we had a trans guy and I regret I wasn't more vocal when it came to my other friends misgendering him, they added him into the 'girls' group chat and stuff. I knew it wasn't the right thing but I was just too shy back then to stand up for him, thankfully I'm not so shy anymore and I will say something now, especially as I know how it feels."	fdxwv1	NonBinary	169	1.0	2020-03-05 16:39:05

Incredibly grateful for my partner who has loved me while I’ve explored my gender identity and expression 🖤		"[deleted]
I think that’s so nice and sweet and I’m so happy and I cannot begin to explain what that means to me I have had a similar journey I told my wife’s boyfriend (cis male binary) and have not been able to tell anyone else he understands me better than anyone I am happy he does because I couldn’t do it without him and oh did I mention he is my wife’s boyfriend
It really is!

is it possible to be nonbinary but embrace womanhood?	"**title correction: and*

i’m not sure if this will make sense. i identify as nonbinary (they/them) kinda leaning towards agender (thinking of my gender as an endless void), but i’m feminine presenting. i’ve recently had such a strong connection with my womanhood and the idea of women are amazing. i love the idea of being a pretty girl who sips tea, wears long dresses, and is unapologetically themself. i’d like to be that.. but i can’t, so i’m stuck. how do i feel closer to my womanhood without self-invalidating my identity? thank you!"	"this is personally just my experience- but i enjoy playing the role of a girl despite not identifying as one. i always put it as “girl in practice but not in theory” lmao

gender presentation can be whatever you want it to be- don’t let other people define how you see yourself.
I consider myself a non binary woman. I dress femme most of the time and enjoy feminine things. I just don’t feel entirely a woman. You should do things you enjoy and not try to conform to some narrow view of what nonbinary is.
Demigirl vibes
Only personal experience here, but I’m a non-binary trans woman. I claim the title and role of “woman” in society, but I don’t feel that’s all there is to it. I present as a binary woman, and internally I feel sort of similar to you about my gender. It’s totally ok!
Non-binary isn't a third gender and it's a while spectrum so you can be feminine and do feminine things. There are no rules to gender or gender expression. Just go have fun. Also non-binary woman is an option too if you want.
Maybe an ID like Lunarian could work? It’s a woman aligned non-binary identity.

Either that or maybe bigender (enban and woman), or demiwoman?
Gender ≠ gender expression. No matter how you dress or act, that doesn’t change your gender, you can wear all the frilly dresses you want, and still be non-binary, same if you dress masculine.
completely completely back everything everyone else has said- non-binary isn't a limiting label, it's just an evasion of the full binary identity. how you present that, how you feel, that's all up to you.

&#x200B;

but the thing that i really really want to pick up on is the phrase 'but i can't' (i assume you feel you can't because, to your mind, it'll negate your non-binary identity). i think how you feel, or how you want to be, has to lead what label you describe yourself with. it's a very thin line but sometimes we all fall into the trap of 'oh well i KNOW I'm x, and so i have to do y' (and not just with gender at all). be what you want to be, feel what you feel, and let that guide what label you choose, rather than the other way round. and that's so so much easier said than done but if your identity is a barrier rather than something that frees you then it's no longer serving its purpose anyway.

&#x200B;

of course I could very much be misinterpreting, but i noticed that and thought it was important to add to all of the other very important replies on this! I hope I've worded it right. sending love friend <3
I am agender and would call myself agenderflux becaude sometimes I feel like I am a woman (but that doesn’t happen often enough to be a demigirl) but I have embraced being very feminine, you can be non-binary and still do feminine things and I do that to the point where sometimes I’ll misgender myself because of how feminine I am lol
Yea I do it. I’m a demigirl though but it’s under the non-binary category
Absolutely. It’s even necessary sometimes - making sure you keep and fight for your and others’ rights, etc.
A man or a woman can do all those things without invalidating their gender identity, so too can a non-binary person☺

I'm comfortable being a non-binary woman, but I also identify as a demigirl.
Gender is your identity, presentation is personal choice, you can embrace feminine qualities without losing who you are.
Yes it is!!!! Gender identity is NOT the same as gender expression. You be you<3
You can absolutely be non-binary and also embrace womanhood! Non-binary ppl aren’t a monolithic third gender and plenty of us lean more toward one side of the binary.
I was AMAB, and I present almost exclusively feminine. Ultimately how you present is up to you. For me looking androgynous to very fem is how I feel comfortable in my body.
i totally understand if you'd really like to find a label you identify with, but in my experience, using labels to DICTATE your gender identity and expression is counter productive. i don't think there is any way to self-invalidate your identity as long as you feel comfortable in the way you are presenting yourself, and it seems like you feel good presenting fem! and that's great!! there is no one way to be non-binary, agender, or even a woman; gender is limitless.
I recently saw a post about how Black womanhood is incredibly compatible with being non-binary, as gender is something society puts on us, expects of us, and rewards us for. Except that society (in the US) is in a constant state of confliction over expecting and rewarding Black women for womanhood. This is changing somewhat now, but the concept came to me when you said this
Yes, absolutely. It’s challenging! I am struggling (but finding happiness, day by day) to embrace being non-binary and also being masculine, a man, a guy, a boy

I sincerely believe that we can be who we are and embrace all of that 💚
As a probably Agender definitely non-binary person, i personally dont like the idea of being a woman but i *do* like the idea of presenting as a woman, so wearing pretty dresses, painting my nails and having a tea party with friends. I also like the idea of presenting as a man, wearing suits, higher pay for no reason and at least having the option of growing a beard. Which btw none of those are exclusive to that particular gender, but still, you can be Agender and be happy presenting womanly. The only person who can tell you how to be you is you. Though if you want to be a woman not just present as a woman, you might be demi or bi gender, might be worth a look :) but again, you identify with what feels best and present what feels best for you.
I  have the same problem, see I’m a guy who likes to dress up as girl sometimes  but  what does that make me? A cross dresser (I mean technically yes) I don’t know something about being in a dress  or lingerie just makes me feel more myself, I love shopping for my female persona (her name is Margaret) , much more fun..   for various reasons I can’t dress up all the time  but I do wear womens underwear under my guy clothes  sometimes  to embrace my female self
I describe myself variously as a nonbinary woman, nonbinary with classical training in womanhood, or nonbinary but epigenetically a woman. I do not believe I would have felt a strong alignment with womanhood if I had been raised in a gender neutral way, but I accept the connection to womanhood that has been forged by force over time. I'm still nonbinary. 

So, yes, totally possible to be nonbinary and embrace womanhood. Nonbinary just means that your gender is not solely and always only congruent with a binary gender.
I’ve actually had somewhat of an issue with this too because of the idea of a “non-binary black woman.” It’s explained as like “yes we identify as non-binary but we’ve grown up treated as a black woman and with continue to be perceived as a black woman in society” despite our non-binary identification. And it’s like the fact that we have ties so strongly to being a black woman makes it hard because me personally I associate my gender identity with not being gendered right? Like the whole point is that I’m not supposed to be called a woman😭. I’m non-binary but femininely presenting too and people will never fail to recognize me as a black woman because of this so I will always have ties with being a black woman.

But with that being said, I think it’s up to you. You are allowed to define and navigate your own gender identification for yourself, so if you are non-binary and embrace womanhood it will never take away that fact that you’re non-binary because that is how YOU define YOURSELF. For example, no one ever gets my pronouns right but I still know for me that I identify as non-binary and I will continue to use they/them pronouns regardless and that’s enough for me! I hope this helped luv:)
Yes
Absolutely. I’m not very feminine myself, but I feel a strong connection to womanhood and even still identify somewhat as a woman. Embracing womanhood and/or femininity doesn’t invalidate your nonbinary identity. Nonbinary people don’t need to fit into one perfect box. We get to be who we are, express ourselves in whatever way makes us happy, and that will not change that we are nonbinary.
i feel exactly the same way!! i id as genderfluid (which is under the nb umbrella) but i feel a strong connection to womanhood as well. like i know that i move through the world as a “woman,” and most people perceive me as such; but at the same time my gender isn’t completely female. idk if this makes sense op but however you choose to identify/present yourself, you’re completely valid!!
Absolutely!
I think you’ll find a way.  Maybe aim for the middle ground.  Dress neautral but wear a purse.  Skip the dress and go for some skinny jeans and a cute blouse with chuckies.  Chuckies are the most unisex shoes I can think of hehe. Oh and paint your nails but maybe with just a clear gloss.  You can even wear just a little eyeliner or a little eye shadow but not much more makeup then that. Just experiment a bit till you find the right balance that kind of lets people know your eNBy and not trying to pass as a girl.  I’ve always liked how some of the guys in make up stores sport facial hair and wear makeup.  They looked amazing and absolutely beautiful.
Why can't you? It's OK if you decide to be a woman who sips tea and wears long dresses, as much is it ok for me to be non binaries but present myself as a man and do all kinds of ""manly"" things.
presentation =/= gender
Yes! Gender is a spectrum so you can be both, neither, and/or, etc. There are no rules to being non-binary.
I tell people girl brain, boy body, happy about both. 

I’m very much on team femme for fashion and friends but there’s too much man connected to completely let go.  Another way to describe me is a trans woman without the dysphoria. This body just works for me I get to dress it up and act how I want.
Im asking myself the same questions as well
Many people do this! You can present however you want (also a youtuber i watch plumbella is agender and uses all pronouns but dresses quite fem and used gendered terms often)
hey, you’re like me! :)
I use she/they pronouns and the way I explain it to folks is that I identify with womanhood/femininity AND I feel my gender identity is more expansive than that. It’s a both/and situation for me.
Hi!! She/her feminine presenting enby here! The only thing that makes you nonbinary is being nonbinary, you can present however you want & embrace your experience with gender in whichever way feels most comfortable to you, you’re not invalidating yourself if that’s what makes you happy 🥰🥰

Hope this helps!
yeah ive been a “woman” my whole life but my core identity is nonbinary, i like to express myself femininely mostly with a bit of masculinity, i can identify with womanhood because i was socialized as a woman, can empathize, but being a woman never felt right and always felt like a bit of a performance, now i can identify it as a performance i can actually have fun with it (as opposed to feeling crushed and boxed into it, which is how i used to feel before realising i was nonbinary)
Could you possibly be demigirl?
Love how you articulate this. Love presenting femme; but it’s performative.
I completely feel the same way
I know, but there’s such a strong stigma about it where I live. Just needed an outside pov.
*isn't always a third gender
Yeah, like you’re a drag queen
Well I'd say fuck those opinions. Gender is a social construct so you being femme and agender or non-binary is perfectly valid and cool. Keep being you and do what makes you happy :)
You can identify as non binary woman and not explain it to everyone. You can use the labels you feel comfortable with your close friends, and use easier to understand with the rest of people
Where I grew up, there was a dangerous stigma about being anything other than cishet. It sucked, but it did teach me one thing: if you’re queer you’ll NEVER be “good enough” for bigots, so don’t listen to them. It doesn’t matter if people are upset that you’re a feminine or woman-aligned enby because people will be upset if you do ANYTHING outside the mold. Be YOURSELF. 

Unless you’re intentionally trying to hurt people with your identity, you have NOTHING to apologize for—so feel you, and use whatever labels fit. Anyone who tries to gatekeep “acceptable” queer identities, tell them to fuck off or send them my way and let me do it.
I'm an ENBY but AFAB.  Personally I wake up, pick my gender  presentation for the day and go on.  My default setting is neutral (jeans t-shirt etc.). I personally make a suit look amazing but I can flip and wear dress and heels when I feel like it.
Precisely. I always described myself that way before I had the words ‘non-binary’ available to me. ☺️

Like everything feminine about me can be removed at the end of my day. (Cue the original Hedwig and The Angry Inch cast version of ‘Wig in a Box.)"	xz2c6h	NonBinary	167	0.98	2022-10-08 20:11:05
Hey there, recently got cheated on and dumped by someone who didn't understand my gender identity and who told me eyeliner looks awful on me.. I'd really need a confidence boost right now pals		"Don't worry about them, if they had good taste than they wouldn't have dumped you. You never would have been able to be yourself with them, so consider yourself free to explore yourself without their toxicity. They're wrong BTW, everyone looks great in eyeliner.
You look amazing!
That sucks you deserve better  and your eyeliner looks fantastic!
I feel you, and my condolences go out to you, I don’t what kind of compliments you prefer I.g masc, fem, neutral, but your eyeliner looks great
Aww thats not right. You do you if i makes you happy someone will come along and love you for it. Your very cute. Not sure of you pronouns but im pretty sure cute could fit for any.
that's super rough and i send hugs if you want 'em! dunno if you need to hear this, but your ex's shitty behavior doesn't reflect poorly on you but on them; you deserve to be treated with love and respect. and for reals, that eyeliner is 🔥🔥🔥
I don't know why but the fact that you put Jacques Chirac more centered than you in the pic made laugh 😅 don't listen to them, you are absolutely gorgeous and beautiful. Eyeliner doesn't just suit you well, it was made for you! Tu es manifaïk!
Oh well, not a good match; you look *amazing*
I got cheated on because I came out as non-binary so I feel it. Eyeliner looks stunning on you; keep your head up.
Well im glad your not with the pos anymore, you look fantastic with eyeliner and don't let anyone tell you otherwise! Don't ever let anyone put you down for being yourself
your hair is amazing!!!
Anyone who wears eyeliner immediately gets like 1000 coolness points in my books!

and you look pretty cool and need some cheering up so have another 100000! :)
That's nonsense everyone looks better with eyeliner.

Also be your truest self and the right person will come along don't stress over this person and their bad taste.
Well I think your eyeliner looks flawless *snaps in a z formation*
Honestly the trash took itself out here. Now you can move onto bigger and better things :)
u give me mad gender envy mon mec 👌🏽 i love ur appearance overall 👏🏽
Vive la France !
coming right up..... \*hug\*
Bruh, they have no taste, your eyeliner looks awesome.
They're just not for you. If somebody can't understand something as simple as gender identity, then they at least should explain that to you politely. I'm very sorry that you had to be dumped, but you're honestly better off without somebody who will be constantly judging you. We will always have your back, and there are so many who are just like you. I truly hope that you can find somebody who understands and loves you. 

Your eyeliner is AWESOME.
honestly everyone does look good in eyeliner (except me lol but i don’t like makeup anyway, it makes me uncomfortable) and i think anyone who doesn’t get or at least try to get their partners gender are ✨a s s h o l e s ✨
Just thank you, that's really kind :)

non-binary bodies can look like anything. how do we communicate this to the outside world?	"IMPORTANT EDIT!!: so… i do obvs want this message to reach cis people. but i also want it to be more commonplace, acceptable, & embraced knowledge among non-binary & trans people, as well!!

this desire has definitely been shaped by my experience as a non-binary person who’s been sexually-harassed, SA’d, hate crimed, & developed atypical anorexia bc of my body & my identity, & how it reads/doesn’t read to the outside world. & i know those, unfortunately, aren’t unique experiences.

obvs we can’t control the things like hate crimes, but i do also truly believe we owe it to ourselves - as a community at such a high risk for suicide, SH, substance abuse, eating disorders, etc - to make this community a safer & more inclusive & expansive place when it comes to the diversity of presentations, transitions & lack of transitions, & body types at any stage of life & any stage of transition/lack of transition. so, when i say i wanna find ways for us to communicate that a non-binary body can look like anything, i do mean that in our own community, too.

lmk if this is confusing!! i’m a really bad writer, but i do really thank y’all for reading & responding, ily!!!

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

when i ever finally get the guts to tell someone i’m, in fact, *not a woman*, the first thing they throw in my face is how obvious it is that i have a woman’s body. they’ll laugh, they’ll touch, they’ll make wildly inappropriate remarks, & i know it’s a little bit my fault for not “playing the game” or “playing by the rules” (real things other non-binary people have told me) or whatever else i’m doing wrong, but it’s also in part bc people don’t associate my hyper-female extreme-pear body type with anything other than cisgender womanhood.

so… *we* know non-binary bodies can be any weight, any figure, *anything*. but the *rest* of the world doesn’t, & we’re all suffering for it. i have an ED, & i know I’m not the only one. i can’t dress the way i want without my body speaking over me, & i know i’m not the only one. i’ve been sexually-harassed & even violently hate crimed over this, & i know i’m not the only one.

so how do we functionally communicate the diversity of non-binary bodies to the rest of the world?"	"> we know non-binary bodies can be any weight, any figure, anything.

“We” don’t actually know, and it’s a common theme on this sub:

- “Do I look nonbinary enough?” / “Do I pass as nonbinary?”

- “Can I look masculine and be nonbinary?”

- “Can I look feminine and be nonbinary?”

> so how do we functionally communicate the diversity of non-binary bodies to the rest of the world?

Be yourself and be visible (if you feel safe and comfortable doing so).

Personally, I don’t mind answering questions about nonbinary identities, given that it’s in a specific dedicated space (such as on queer subs on reddit) that I have control over how much I can interact with, and that the person seems genuinely interested. But other than that, I don’t engage in conversations about the validity of my gender identity.

So put as much effort to educate people (both in and out of nonbinary spaces) as you want and are able to, but don’t feel obligated to overextend yourself. It can get exhausting. If you respond to every claim that invalidates your identity, you’re likely to burn yourself out.
I just wanna start by saying this: There is no game, there are no rules, whoever is telling you that is gatekeeping and ignorant. You’re not doing anything wrong because **there is no wrong way to be nonbinary**. (I think you know this deep down but i understand how hurtful and damaging it can be when you’re told otherwise) 

I think the only way to communicate this is to just…keep communicating it. The concept of nonbinary identities is SO new to most of the world (despite nonbinary people always existing). We just have to keep talking about it. I know it’s awful when shitty things happen but idk what else we can do. Just don’t give up, keep educating people, don’t give in to shitty people who tell you to “just play the game.” No, fuck that, we’re not playing games here, we’re just trying to live our lives. 

Another thing I think is important is emphasizing that not only can nonbinary people look any sort of way, but so can *binary* people! A woman can look like anything, a man can look like anything, and nonbinary people can look like anything! We gotta disconnect  gender from expression.
It's not your fault and there *are* no rules but I feel like a lot of folks don't know that. Hell there's a lot of that on just this sub. This is why the ""do I look nonbinary?"" and ""gender me"" posts are dangerous. They reinforce the rules (mostly binary and/or cis) people try to enforce. We have to stop it in our own communities first. The cis won't listen, they're always gonna gender you somehow because they're Like That. But we have to do better. When other trans people are spreading that bullshit, tell them they're wrong, don't let them tell the kids on here that there's only one way to be
""Playing by the rules""??? What rules?  
I am sorry you are being harrased.
We dont. This isnt something people like that need convinced of. Those people are assholes. 

We dont need (and in fact cant) to put together to perfect argument to let them know that you can be nonbinary no matter what you look like.

They either gotta start respecting people regardless of their gender etc... or they will continue being bigoted. Unfortunately theres no argument or performance we can do to make them change their mind.
Okay I want you to know that the way others touch you without permission has nothing to do with how you present at all it’s not your fault that they choose to hurt you, they should know not to touch people inappropriately but they decide to do it anyway.
The fact that you've been harrassed and hatecrimed over your body is a function of the system not your body. Being black, being queer, being nonbinary, being trans, being short, tall, skinny fat none of those things are objectively negative things. They are descriptions of a phenomenon that humans are desperate to quantify and categorize. 

&#x200B;

In all reality the only way we communicate the diversity of nonbinary bodies is by being exactly that. In our bodies by the rules WE want to live by not by the rules of anyone else. 

I didn't shave my head to look nonbinary. I shaved my head a 6 years ago because I was exhausted by the pressure of being a ""black girl"" and the pressure to grow ""long hair"". And the time energy and exhaustion hair was taking up in my life. I released myself from hair to become more real. And in doing so it was one of the first steps in freeing myself from the shackle of the gender binary (little did i know lol). 

Do what makes YOU feel good, not what makes you FIT IN to the culture of nonbinary (and YES there IS a culture because ALL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL GROUPS HAVE CULTURE). Sometimes queer culture eats its own members in an effort to maintain group cohesion. But like we always say. You don't owe anyone androgyny. 

And if you want a real biological to the ground answer, the female sex is nature's default sex. Female gonads, female development, female adjacent characteristics is the baseline upon which fetal development initiates other primary and then secondary sex characteristics. So next time you think ""my body is hyper female"" remember that female is neutral. It is simply the nature of our patriarchal society which has designated the body you were born with a gender assigned at birth. It is western patriarchal ideology that has tied natal sex and secondary sexual development to gender.

Fact is we are gonna suffer for it and as any minority member we do have to develop some degree of thick skin. is it right? fuck no. But is it survival. Absolutely. 

I got mammed at the gas pump today. Do i care? Initially into my transition totally. Now. No. Why? How would I expect this person to know my name let alone my gender. Now if a close friend were to ma'am me i'd be pissed and they would defintely hear it. But if my 73 year old surrogate mom ""missy""s me am I mad. No. She's fucking 73 and I havent even come out to her yet. I've just given her a name change. But she's a very loving accepting woman and she tries her best and has been working her darnest just to get shit right with my wife's name.

&#x200B;

Change is fought for. Rights are never fully won. They are continously fought for.
Sadly, I don’t think there are any shortcuts here, we just have to play the long game. We live our truths, refuse to entertain the concept of presentation standards for nonbinary people, and wait for the world to come around. It’s going to take time. Probably a lot of it. Getting public opinion to evolve is always a slow slog.

I won’t pretend it doesn’t suck, because it does. I manage by keeping future nonbinary kids front of mind. Every time we refuse to justify our identities, apologize for our bodies, or change our presentations for the sake of others, we normalize ourselves a tiny bit more, and chip a flake off the boulder of ignorance that weighs us down. Every time we refuse to ‘play the game,’ we remove a tiny bit of its power, and inch toward a kinder, safer world for the kids who come after us.

It’s not easy to absorb the hostility we face as nonbinary people, or the particular resentments aimed at those of us who don’t fit the arbitrary expectations of the “nonbinary ideal.” It’s exhausting, it’s infuriating, and it just plain hurts. But I find it easier to keep doing it when I think about the sad, confused kid I once was, and how much it would’ve meant to meet an adult who was like me and wasn’t afraid to say so, and who knew how to keep being themself even when the world didn’t want them to.
Something I'm trying to learn and embody is the resilience and defiance that I see other queer/trans/nonbinary people navigating life with. If they don't like what you say or who you are, fuck em. You don't need to seek approval from people who fundamentally disrespect you. Wear what you want, behave how you want as long as you're not hurting anyone. Instill and strengthen your sense of self before you try to bring others to your perspective.

I think all that kind of injonctions and stupid stuff come from a very vocal minority of AFAB slim white and young enbies who want to export constant in queer spaces both gender assumption and bodyshaming they learned from the terfy cis feminist social circles they politically educated themselves in.
In my country they pushed really hard to make queer social circles formally and informally excluding of cis gays/ bi mens, hormonated and masc looking trans guys + AMAB enbies and non cispassing trans woman's because they pretend that's it's necessary to make cis heterosexual woman confortable in queer spaces.
In the end what their fighting for is re-creating very gendered norms inside queer spaces and some kind of gynocraty where AFAB highly feminine looking people are supposed to be the only possible leaders and therefore need to be highly differentiate from others queers.
I am also a VERY femme non-bean (im in my 30s for context i guess). I like cute sweaters, I have a high pitched voice, and I wear make up. Everything that screams ""woman"" to most people. I also have a pear shaped body and I mostly like my curves (except the boobs, HATE those). 

all of that is a major reason why I have only come out to one person, my partner, and thats it. largely I do think that most trans/non-cis people understand where we are coming from, but my cis het parents?? not in a million years.
that’s true, i definitely worded that incorrectly, especially as someone that’s been told by other trans & non-binary people to alter my body or face the consequences. when i point out that there shouldn’t be consequences for just having a body, i get immediately shut down & accused of being lazy & unable to accept that my body will always read as female to other people unless i make drastic changes, some of which i may not even want. but hopefully at least a number of people understand that any body can be a non-binary body.

i guess it’s a double-edged sword bc i can do everything in my power to be visible, but my body makes me invisible. i can wear pride stuff & talk about non-binary rights all day, & at the end of the day im basically regarded as just a cis ally. there’s literally no way for my to communicate my truth as a non-binary person in a non-binary body bc my body reads as a cishet woman’s body to both cis & trans people. i can put all the effort in the world into getting people to understand that i have a non-binary body, & then it ultimately doesn’t matter bc it’s a cis woman’s body to everyone else but me.
i definitely agree, it’s just frustrating bc i *can’t* communicate it. like, physically i am not *allowed* or *able* to communicate it. people have laughed in my face, people have groped my tits & ass & been like “idk, seems like a woman’s body to me”, people have slapped my ass, grabbed my crotch, pulled off my clothes, told me to starve myself & then *maybe* i’ll be non-binary enough for them…

& i know that seems like i have really bad judgement, but those were all *abrput* escalations in situations where i assumed i was safe & that everyone kinda knew anyway, i guess? i know that seems really naive, but like: some of those things happened at *work* - & i was forced to come out at work, & everyone saw & heard, & it was a whole big uncomfortable discussion, & those interactions still happened anyway. some of those interactions happened in queer spaces where i fully had pride gear on & people were just like “nah, those aren’t breastforms, kinda seems like your tiny 5-foot-something frame grew those on its own, & that checks all my stereotype boxes of what makes a ReAl WoMaN!”.

i know i’m responsible for some of that (most of that), but i also feel it would be deeply irresponsible of me - both for the sake of my own mental health, & of course for the rest of the non-binary community - to not even *try* in situations i assume are safe. but idk, i’m a little dumb, & i’m just so frustrated with my body for talking over me, & my complete inability to get a word in edgewise.
i totally agree, we do definitely need to unlearn the narrow definitions of what bodies “should” be in our own community - i think that’ll make things better for everyone.

i guess just, like… how? so, i’ve tried posting about my own experience (not excessively or anything, just here & there), & it *pisses people off* that my body doesn’t work by their rules & that i don’t have the transition goals that they have. then the conversation can’t go anywhere, bc all people see is an idiot with the wrong body that’ll either come around to full binary transition or die (that’s an *actual thing* that people have messaged me: that either i’ll realize i’m FTM & act accordingly (whatever that means), or I’ll kms. kinda dark!)

& IRL these things don’t go that well, either. even to the very few non-binary people i’ve ever met IRL, the fact that this is my natural body & i’m just “letting it happen” is a complete enigma. it’s not that i’m being an asshole about it, & i would never intentionally talk over another person’s experience, but the way that i experience dysphoria & having a body freaks people out. i’ve even been lucky enough to meet a fellow non-binary person that agrees with my woowoo “your body is a vessel for your soul 🌀” stuff, & even *they* had to slide in the little footnote of “but… i mean, if you lost your curves & built muscle, you’d be more convincing”.

at this point, is this not even a real problem? am *i* the problem?
thank you. 💞

i agree that there shouldn’t be any rules, but i’ve vented about my dysphoria & difficulty with being read  as a woman socially while not being a woman at all, & i’ve gotten DMs from other non-binary people on this website telling me that i have to “play by the rules” - meaning, if i don’t want to be referred to as a woman anymore, i need to deal with the things that make me look like one. people see not transitioning or not being able to achieve androgyny as breaking the rules, & they see the dysphoria & misgendering that may come from that as facing the consequences. for example, i had one person DM me to say that i need to acknowledge that weight-lifting & body-building is probably the only way for me to achieve a masculine or androgynous appearance, & that i need to “accept the consequences” & “take accountability” for not doing those things when i get misgendered or feel dysphoric, even though i don’t particularly wanna be all that muscular anyway.
i totally agree about the assholes & i do have to apologize for not being more specific, i wasn’t even thinking about intentionally-transphobic assholes when i was making the post, i was just thinking about people who truly don’t know & then maybe go on to say or do asshole-ish transphobic things later on outta ignorance.

for example, i had this one coworker at a previous job. she wasn’t an asshole, but she’d literally never heard of trans people before. she made a lotta uncomfortable comments about my body, like how if she looked like me she’d only wear pin-up clothes & she doesn’t understand why i’m wasting such a fertile body wearing baggy clothes & not getting with men, & that her husband would find her sexier & she’d feel so much sexier with thick thighs like mine. when i was like “uh… i mean, i don’t really see it that way”, & she asked me to elaborate & i came out to her, she threw it back in my face that i can’t *possibly* be trans (once i explained to her what trans is), because i have such an *incredibly womanly body*. it’s kinda an asshole-ish thing to say, but also of course she’s gonna say it bc she started that conversation not knowing what trans people are & ended that conversation confronted with the least-passable trans person in existence.

people may continue to uphold narrow, dangerous, & exclusionary standards of what makes a person or both feminine, masculine, or androgynous bc they don’t know any better. so i guess what i’m asking is, how do we get this conversation out there so people maybe know better?
i appreciate it. 💙

though i can’t blame them. they’ve never seen a body like mine that wasn’t for touching & grabbing. men literally lose their minds over my body, & there’s no way for me to effectively hide that this is what i look like. i’m just so tired of having this stupid fucking body, i wouldn’t wish this body type on my worst enemy.
i totally agree with everything you’re saying. 💖

unfortunately… i mean, there might medically be something wrong with me to make me look this way. people constantly ask if it’s surgery or an estrogen production disorder. biologically, there is something *majorly* wrong with me - &, if there isn’t, thatd be the most fucked up possibility of them all, honestly. 😅

i guess i just struggle with the fact that, when i live my my rules & present how i wanna present & live in the body i’m living in, it doesn’t actually… *do* anything. there’s no way that i’m making a difference or showing an example of what a non-binary person can look like bc i 100% read as a cishet woman. people read it as communicating the diversity of *women’s* bodies, which is also important, but my body makes it so i can’t physically or even conversationally express what i really am, bc nobody will ever believe me & that’s just really frustrating. 

not that i’m running around being like “oh, i’m having a fat ass, but not in a woman way, actually!”. but i think you saw my other comment on how other non-binary people IRL have told me something about my body’s gonna have to change, or else i’m just gonna have to get used to being a woman forever.

(also sorry, i think you replied to that comment, but my Reddit’s glitching & it won’t let me see it! 😢)
i think that’s all very true. 💕

but also… when i do all that stuff, there’s no way for me to communicate *that* i’m a non-binary person doing it. it’s this weird problem that feeds into itself where i can’t prove that non-binary bodies can look like anything bc i don’t have a body that people would ever remotely feel proves that i’m non-binary.

also, i know it’s gonna take forever, but it really… can’t. this shit’s been plaguing me forever. the way people talk about & perceive & interact with my body has ruined my entire life. i truly don’t want to put up with this body anymore, not the way others see it & think it’s okay to treat it.
i do believe in all that & stuff, but also…

this question was also in part about communicating it to the rest of the community. i’ve had other non-binary people - who *should know better, but don’t* - harass me about my body shape & how i “should fix it”, & then not understand why that’s inappropriate or none of their business or why my body looks different than how they’ve been told it should.

i’m also a non-binary person with an eating disorder, which definitely stems from the fact that my curves make my body read as female/woman, when i don’t identify that way & don’t think curves should be gendered that way. EDs are a huge problem in the trans community, & i do truly think expanding the understanding of what a non-binary body can look like & which traits can be what would really solve that. for example, curves can be masculine. saying that makes me sound insane, but it’s true & should be treated as such. they can also be androgynous. i guess i just want there to be more resources for body neutrality, positivity, & joy in the non-binary community - for those who transition, & those who don’t, & for anyone who looks any possible way. but idk how to make that happen or even *help*, & it literally stresses me out all the time.
yeah, i guess that makes sense.

i’ve never set a boundary without fucking it up. i’ve never set a boundary regarding my gender or my body that hasn’t caused people to react poorly or put me in danger. does that mean i’m… kinda hurting the cause? i don’t mean to piss people off, I’ll just tell them not to talk about my body in a certain way, & they’ll fly off the handle.
i checked your profile to see if we were from the same place (we’re not, i was just wondering), & completely off-topic but i *love* your forehead piercing!! 💘

where i’m from, it’s a little different, in that you can’t be a feminine-looking enby (AFAB or otherwise); you also can’t be masculine; you literally *have* to uphold the perfect stereotype of androgyny or you’re basically dogshit. that’s part of why i struggle so much, bc i’m definitely not slim enough to matter, effectively; regardless of what i wear or how much or little i weigh, my body stores it in extreme curves that make me 100% feminine & 100% invalid, no matter what.

i’m so sorry you also have to deal with gatekeeping & body-shaming & TERFy bullshit, friend. i really hope things get better for everyone, ASAP.
you deserve to be understood by other people, & i’m sorry that you don’t have that rn. 💞

nothing wrong with being very femme, though! idk if i’m *very* femme, i guess im feminine but non-traditionally, but it doesn’t even matter bc it doesn’t read right. i’m very driven by extreme aesthetics, like rave clothes or looking like an alien or goth aesthetics & stuff like that, bc it feels otherworldly & affirming to me… but i also know all people see is a curvy broad w/ a fuckable ass in terrible clothes & makeup. nothing reads right on my body, which is definitely an issue with my fucking ridiculous body that i need to fix, but i think that could *also* be fixed by not limiting aesthetics or identities to one body type, but 🤷🏼 my hips are too wide for me to be fully human, so what do i know?
who the fuck are these twats you're friends with?

They fucking suck. 

And also it really depends on where you live and where you are.Gender is one of the most fundamental constructs of the patriarchal society to reject its construct is to reject one of the core ""truths"" that holds this absolute garbage system of dominance and power together. It WONT be easy and you DO live in an alternate persepctive from the majority of society. Not gonna sugar coat that for you. the question is, do you NEED to be externally validated? are there better spaces, people and places you can interact in to be validated?
You're not responsible for any of that. The harassment and assault is not your fault, not even the tiniest little bit. I understand how it can feel that way but I assure you. It is the fault of the people who did these things to you... not yours! (And yes, you can blame the people who grabbed you w/o permission. They know better. If they say they can't help it, they're just trying to make you feel responsible for them assaulting you. It's not your fault.) 💖
fuck them.

That is all. 

Bitch (not you) no amount of ""body building"" is gonna alter the fact that i'm 5'3, got a small bone frame, oval shaped face, small hands, and 34D/DD breasts. Like my fuck ass is gonna be gendered female by society no matter if I chop off my breasts or nah. And I LIKE having a female body. I don't like my uterus, I'd prefer smaller breasts but I LIKE a lot of things about my body. But I also spent almost a decade coming to terms with my femaleness/femininty and by abandoning that I also embraced my internal masculinity. And by abandoning that I have come to a cetner pint of my own divinity. I still have dysphoria, but I treat it the way I treated my dysphoria over being ""too masculine"" in shape as a ""girl"". 

Society will never love people like us. So take time to care for yourself. And your female sex doesn't inhibit your gender. There is no REQUISITE to make your SEX and GENDER congruous. In many ways I ENJOY that my sex and gender are incongrous. It is a powerful thing to channel this much masculine energy in this much of a socially constructed ""feminine"" body. 

but i've been in therapy for a long time and have had a long time to come t terms with my ""otherness"" in every way shape or form.
As a freshly-hatched baby enby I am already sick of all the infighting that occurs in these communities.  I think that at least some of it comes from a need for self-validation and attacking others as a result, and as someone currently dealing with imposter syndrome I suppose I get that, but that still doesn't make it ok.

FWIW, though, you remind me of my wife (I will say wife as she ""loosely"" identifies as female out of convenience, and doesn't mind the term), in that she presents that way because it's what she's comfortable with but out of the blue several years ago just said ""you know what, I don't feel like much of a woman"" and like ""that part of her brain is missing.""  The fact that I completely understood and could relate to that should have clued me into something, but oh well I got there eventually after realizing that my idea of a ""man"" had been holding me back from who I actually wanted to be.  Anyways I guess my point is that our society is so binary and gendered that it's hard for people who don't really know you to see you as anything more than one or the other, but (hopefully) for those that know you, for my wife's part anyways, even before she said anything I always found it off referring to her as a ""girl"" or ""woman,"" and pretty much just always saw and referred to her as \[pet name\] and just a partner with compatible genitalia.
I mean it sounds like you approached that perfectly. And while yes, its good to be patient and gentle when people genuinely dont know abt something... her proceeding to say you cant be trans wasnt part of her not having heard abt trans people. That was her personal judgement bc shes judgy and thinks she knows best. (Also demonstrated by her comments abiut your body and abt what you should do with you life)

Though, while not an argument you can make to win people over, i find a ""what is *that* supposed to mean"" or a ""whats your problem"" maybe a ""how dare you"" and then avoiding conversation with them (provided they dont backtrack), and if asked why be honest abt what they did.

Its harder for people to belittle you when you dont flinch or look hurt and just look at them like they said some blatantly wrong and rude shit (which they did).
I’m sorry, no body is for touching and grabbing without consent but not everyone has compassion. I have a rather bubbly rear end so I can relate to some extent people really do like to touch it and it took a long time to gather the nerve to make them stop. Also my body type really can’t be hidden either, I’m not even sure if surgery will impact that very much for me but only time will tell, my voice is a giveaway for my AGAB too so people make lots of assumptions. It sucks.

i live somewhere pretty rural that skews older, & i work in places that skew *way* older (geriatric care), so i’m constantly surrounded by people that’re like “fat ass? that’s a woman!”. but that’s fine, i guess.

i don’t think this is about me “needing” any sorta validation, i just need to know what to do to make this world a more accepting place (not that i can do much, but i gotta do *something*).

i’m a non-binary person with an ED, & i’m not the only one - & my ED is directly tied to being in the wrong body, in a body that doesn’t read the way it’s supposed to, & all the traumas that’ve resulted in that. i’m also a non-binary person who was the victim of a violent hate crime that was perpetrated bc of my identity & bc of my body (don’t worry, i know this for a fact: they were very conversational while it was going on). i am also by no means the only person who’s had that experience, but i’d like to create a world where i’m one of the last, in the grand scheme of things.

i haven’t experienced every trauma possible based in the world not knowing what non-binary bodies can & do look like, & i don’t claim to. but i wanna help - bc the traumas i *did* face & *continue* to face were avoidable, or would’ve been in a world that gets it. i just dunno how to facilitate a world that gets it, so this shit (& less harrowing shit, obviously) can stop happening to us.
i’m also really tired of the infighting, but i feel like i almost kinda cause it accidentally sometimes, which is 😓

i only want to lift other people up & to validate all of our bodies, but people see my lack of a medical transition despite severe dysphoria as an attack on them & their choices. & i’ve had other non-binary people, completely unprovoked, tell me what i should do with my body according to their rules, & then when that causes me to feel bad, they treat me like i’ve completely lost my mind. & maybe i have, i’m just not able to medically transition, k i want that to be okay. & i want medical transition to be okay too. & i want all results & all ways of being to be okay. but… i guess i just kinda suck.

it’s cool that your wife thinks about those things that way! i wish i could, but if i have to be a woman by default, i’d die. i am absolutely not a woman, but i know i’ll always been one to others bc of my fucking nasty body so 🤷🏼
And of course, continuing to hsve genuine truthful answers for honest questions when you are able. But most of this has less to do with people not knowing and more with people having already made their mind up that youre wrong about your own experiences.
i’ve tried the “what’s that supposed to mean?” a few times, with horrible results. i do appreciate the suggestion, though! but i guess (most likely due to how hyper-female i am, as well as the fact that people read any gender non-conformance not as being gender non-conforming, but as being too naive to dress myself & conduct myself “correctly), when i ask people that, they assume it’s a legitimate question.

i’ve had people say *disgusting* things about my body, been like “what the hell’s *that* supposed to mean?”, & then they’ll launch into the worst possible tirade about how i’m a goddess of fertility & how much they’d love to jizz all over my thick, luscious woman curves 🤮 

i hate living.
oh yeah, i definitely don’t try to explain my identity to strangers, sorry for presenting myself as naive enough where that would sound like a good idea. 😔 but even then, nobody listens, bc my body gives them permission, in their minds.
i just think this could all be avoided if i/we, as a community, could find a way to beat it to the punch. if we find a way to tell everyone non-binary people can have any body, then hopefully people will have fewer invasive comments about our bodies.

the problems that i’ve faced in this body are a direct result of me *not* being able to communicate that i’m not a woman, people saying & doing things that make me dysphoric (& also that women shouldn’t have to go through anyway, most of the time), me trying to explain what the issue is, & my explanation not mattering bc it’s a woman’s body so there’s no way a non-woman is stuck inside it, bc a non-woman couldn’t *possibly* have a body *that feminine*.
Idk. I feel like the alternative ia go into every new room/ situation with a ""hi! My name is X i am nonbinary"". Which id hate. Both in terms of doing and in terms of hearing it. It makes people feel like they have to have a response to your gender
oh no! sorry, no, i definitely don’t do that! 😅 props to those who do/can, though! i am not that brave!

so, the way i see human bodies is inherently broken. like, there’s something wrong with me. that’s just true. & maybe i’m also trying to break other people & just not realizing it, but like… i truly don’t see other people’s AGAB, or secondary sex characteristics as meaning anything. literally. i’m just like “oh, they have a beard. that’s chill!”. it doesn’t tell me anything about them, & honestly i’ll probably also forget until i see them again.

maybe it’s selfish, but all i want is for people to not automatically see that i have an AFAB body - &, if they do, i don’t want it to *mean anytning*. i just want people - at the *very least* - to be like “okay, that body has curves. whatever”. bc it *truly SHOULDNT matter*, but it matters so much to everyone right now. maybe it won’t one day. 

& idk what to do if we never get there."	zg8945	NonBinary	168	0.99	2022-12-08 19:10:40

You look great OP. Wish I looked good in a tie. You pull it off very well
Can never go wrong with a tie and a button-down! You look super handsome!
Thank you. I did feel real good even if it was just for a while 'cause of my parents.
Thank you! I love wearing formal and semi-formal clothing that is 'traditionally masculine'. On the other hand I absolutely despise long gowns. If I could go back and change my prom outfit I'd wear suit.
Thank you. I borrowed it from my father so I had to return it before he would flip. I really like how it looks and in the future will buy my own.
I'm quite new here so I'm starting of simple. Thank you for the kind words I've never been called handsome before this post. It sure hits different."	kdn6wf	NonBinary	162	0.99	2020-12-15 14:58:12
I've been lately thinking hard about my identity. I'm not happy being a 100% male, but I'm not female either. I think I'm somewhere on the spectrum, I Identity as a non-binary person. Still using he/him pronouns, becouse on my native language (Polish) there is no good gender neutral pronoun.		"this is super valid! i'm happy you're taking the time to get to you yourself better. :)
Hey, I'm Polish too and it sucks that literally everything is gendered so you can't really make up a pronoun unless you're ready to make a new suffix and stuff like that to satisfy our grammar :/ but no matter what we're still valid :)
I’m glad you’re figuring yourself out. And the pronouns are all personal. You’re still non-binary even if you use he/him pronouns. I speak English and i have not found any pronouns that I feel fit me so i just go with any that a person wants to use, as long as it isn’t being used as a negative or attacking way.
Isn't there a 'neuter' gender in Polish? I did a linguistics project on it last semester and if I remember right it's not straightforward and pretty context dependent. Like a group of men is distinguished and a group of women or anyone else is a neuter group. I hope I got that sort of right, it was fun to explore my heritage :)
Sounds like an open opportunity to create a neutral pronoun for your native language. ❤️
Hey friendo hang in there!! You’re valid even if you use “gendered” pronouns! Hopefully we figure out something for Slavic languages someday! Also I really like your look btw!!💛
You look cute! Also wicked bass! What kind is it?
This is very valid and fair! As someone whose first language is also extremely gendered and who also ends up using a binary pronoun most of the time, I feel you. I've heard things are rough for LGBT+ folks in Poland, so good luck to you, I hope you & your friends stay safe. Also, your smile is very soft, and I like your haircut & beard, it frames your face very well :)
Gendered languages suck! I'm lucky though, we only have one gender neutral pronoun which applies to all people and objects. You can try using he/him in Polish but they/them in English. These are two languages with two different grammatical structures, anyway.
Lol mood r/egg_irl
Thank you <3 It's a long and hard process, but i finally start to feel Luke myself :)
Yeah, it sucks. There are people trying to figure it out, but it's awkward to me at the moment, do I'll stay with ""on"" for now
Yeah, I don't much care about pronouns either, it just sucks that there's not a lot of options in my -and many others- language
There is the pronoun ""ono"" which applies to children and theoretically is gender neutral, but it is used pejorativly to describe trans people, so I don't want to apply it to myself
I'm not Polish but quite close both geographically and linguistically speaking. The problem with neuter genders in Slavic languages is that they tend to be dehumanising. In Czech you can use ""it"" to refer to a child or baby because the grammatical gender of ""child"" and ""baby"" is neuter. However, when you're talking about a specific kid, using the kid's name and he/she pronouns is still preferred. Other than that, ""it"" only refers to things or animals and used for an adult it's either a joke or an insult.
I appreciate the sentiment but unfortunately it's nearly impossible with Slavic languages. The whole structure of the language is so heavily gendered that you can't just change the pronouns, you have to change verbs and adjectives too. And doing that would be insanely complicated because reasons I won't bore you with.
At the end of the day it doesn't really hurt me as a binary trans person but I still feel for all my siblings who have to choose between two pronouns that just don't fit.
Thanks <3 there is lots more to figure out in slavic countries than just pronouns. People don't quite yet understand the concept of trans people in general here. But it is all slowely changing for the better I think :) all the best to you and thank you for accepting me in here <3
Thank you <3 It's an old Mayones five string. Don't know the exact designation though, as it is not in production anymore
You are too sweet <3 thank you! Thankfully my friends are awesome badasses and support eachother, the change in Poland is coming, and LGBT folks will have it better here soon. I Hope at least
I understand that. I wish there was a lot of better language for all of us to better explain ourselves.
Just to be sure: I hope you are not using it because it doesn't suit you personally, and not because ""non-binary isn't transgender"". Enby identities are a subclass of trans identities so if you feel like it fits you, I'd encourage you to use it. :)
I understand to a fair degree. English is my primary/native language, but I am fluent in a few. And I hope some day in the future (sooner rather than later) we all find language descriptors that fit us as individuals. ❤️
You're welcome! I'm glad you have friends with you like this. Keep on rocking on <3
Sorry if i was unclear - i don't use it because it is used as a insult against trans people, and I as a nb am trans :) poles can be quite transphobic, so I don't want to put myself in their crosshairs
Oooh yikes, sorry I didn't know that. Thanks for the follow up:  good to know that and hard agreed on not using it!"	gu2u8c	NonBinary	167	1.0	2020-05-31 17:14:35
Expressing my identity has caused me to slowly look more and more like a grandmother.		"Yo, if we can make grandpa-in-suspenders a hot enby aesthetic then grandma-in-a-sweater is equally valid and gorgeous.
You like like you should be snowed in at a cabin in the mountains sipping hot cocoa and reading to pass the time. I'm here for it.
I love my grandma but she def isn't this stylish
Agreed with everyone else that you're gorj but that is also some damn smooth camera work.
nb grandma? can we call you grandma bee??
None of my grandparents looked this fabulous.
I hope I look this good when I'm a grandparent!

Oh wait that's right I'm not having kids because I don't want them to live through the worse part of climate change I will miss out on, and I doubt I'll adopt because that's expensive and I don't even know if they let enbies adopt in my state.

Still! You look *fine* ;) and I wish I could look like you.
Valid thanks :3
Thanks lol
Thanks lol I’m a talented narcissist
Yes!!!! Omg please do!!! (I may have to change my user flair to something like that lol)
NICE!!!!!"	apuobb	NonBinary	160	0.99	2019-02-12 15:50:50
I feel like nothing and I don’t want to.	I don’t know how to deal with this. I want a gender but it’s just not there. I thought maybe I could be a binary trans man but that doesn’t feel right. My chosen name doesn’t feel right either, but nothing does. It feels like my whole identity is just one big void and I hate it. I have no interest in microlabels and I don’t want to be agender. I don’t know what to do and I’m frustrated to the point of tears because of this instability.	"Hey first off we have got you.

Is it that you want a binary gender that isn't there? I think being NB is owning that instability to create a stability. For example, realising that I can shop all over the clothes store and the only limit is my own style is pretty big. 

Name, time to an extent. All names sound odd until they are used commonly, if you ever name a child you'll see this life go from 'bump' to ""Alex"" and it only starts to become lodged in your head after a few days of saying the name on repeat 16 million times.

Is that helpful?
I call myself Deimos the Greek god of terror . Cause he's the Greek embodiment of angry spirits and stuff. Exists as pure energy mostly and that's what I want to be most of the times.
Any name takes time getting used to. So cut yourself a break.
Hey, you’re not alone in the gender void place 💜 I don’t have much advice but to stay following those little flickers of euphoria when they appear. Answers will come. Big love.
[deleted]
You said “I want a gender but it’s just not there.” You also mentioned instability. Do you feel like by being “something” instead of “nothing,” a gender instead of a non-gender, “having” instead of “not having” you will feel more stable? Is stability what you hope to gain by having a gender? 

Do you see this feeling of instability relating to other aspects of your life? 

I really hope you can find some ground to stand on. I want you to feel real and valid. It can be so hard sometimes! I am interested to know more.
You don't have to worry, gender is just a social construct, labels are optional, just be yourself, wear whatever you want, act however you want and maybe get a more comfortable haircut if you want
I feel that in a way. when I was 16 after trying axe body wash I was realizing maybe I'm genderfluid. then at 18 I was like maybe I'm nonbinary bc ever since I was 16 I wasnt okay with being called ""she"" online; it just felt weird so then tried they them and it felt good, now I'm trying he (not a lot of people call me he) (also read your replies and everyone else's) I feel you because I don't wanna be seen as femme, but I don't want to be a man even though feeling it now even though being called sir and he feels so good but testosterone scares me, changing what I've been so used to scares me (getting a binder, trying on boxers) even though I've been wearing technically men's clothing and baggy clothing for awhile now there's a lot of stuff that scares me like voice training it's like I don't want to be a female I don't want to be called ma'am, I'd rather be called sir but I can't have that unless I changed my voice, get a binder. and I don't want to fully identify as man maybe because of the stereotypes of men and I've wondered ""am I doing this just to be more attractive to people or am I doing this to feel more attractive to other people AND myself as a better version of myself"" and I'm really just confused but I want to be an emo boy, I have gender envy with guys who wear alt clothing, but I also want to be a femboy but not a man. I want to have a flat chest and wear skirts. I want the binder for the public to hide myself, and I wonder as well ""am I afraid of being a girl or is that who I am"" and with my family misgendering me and saying idk what I want I'm just even more confused but being called a ""girl"" makes me cringe thinking about it even.
Ive been confused my whole life. I tried calling myself a boy name as a kid, and it did last a little while but honestly I was just a kid so wanted to play and parents stopped bothering so I sort of just didn’t push it. I always knew I was different.

Finally, it sort of clicked that im genderfluid. Like wtf how did I not realise this. I was a boy when I was small, I was a boy again when I was 13 and wore my dads clothes, hormones and realising my bisexuality and I just wanted to look like a hot girl. Here and there I would just wear boyfriends clothes. Totally opposite of the persona I had, but not a single one cared and they are all straight cis males. Like top to toe their entire outfits down to their shoes and belts.

Then I got married and was all wedding dress girly girly

But the whole of my life was that am I a man??? Thing. And no. Im not. Because it happens here and there. And there and here. If I came out as trans I know full well the next day Id be in a dress and saying Im a girl.

Then now Im like well shit. Because of COURSE im genderfluid.

Im not binary. But I am not both. I am one or the other or a bit more towards the scale to one than the other. Just never simultaneously both strong at once. My pronouns at the moment are nothing because I dont like any at all they all make me cringe. 

You really dont have to give it a name. I didnt have a name for what I am til I hit my 30s. I had absolutely no idea and when people asked I was like erm im just me. Then the name id been searching for all my life just popped up!!

So, relax and remember there is plenty of time to figure it out. We are all here and hopefully can help you get there.
Hey loved one, don't worry about having all the answers right now. Nobody has all the answers, and assuming you're young - you've got PLENTY of time to think about it. Or not! 

If you're feeling pressure to label yourself, remember that it's other people's problem to figure it out, not yours! Not unless you want it to be your problem. But it's perfectly valid to not know where you're at or even where you want to be right now. I'm almost 26 and still can't decide between agender, genderfluid, etc. and it's ok.

Please hang in there and spend some time meditating, enjoying yourself, building yourself up, and paying attention to what brings you joy. You'll find your answers when you're ready to know them.
Not sure what advice I have but like…I was a binary trans man for ages and then realized I was agender. It’s a difficult process. Give yourself grace and patience.
I often think about how freeing it would feel for there to be no notion of gender in the world, while everyone just expresses themselves however they want. No expectations or judgement or even labels. 

I get how labels are useful for getting ideas across in this world but they're also not. Labels and names come with too many assumptions that often aren't accurate.
I totally respect that you don’t like microlabels or xenogenders, but I figure it could be worthwhile for other people reading this thread to comment that gendervoid or voidgender are fairly common xenogenders that people with similar experiences sometimes go for.

(I personally enjoy xenogenders as something very deeply removed from the current sort of “spectrum.” I present masc irl but generally identify as stargender in nb spaces.)
You might be a xenogender?
[removed]
I actively hate my femininity and have zero interest in being perceived as female. I've been going by Kieran for years now, it shouldn't still feel weird. I guess it's like... being anything other than a man of some sort feels like admitting that I still have femininity left in me when I want nothing more for it to be gone, but also, I'm not a man.
Thank you so much, this really meant a lot to me <3
Damn this is such a mood :(

I think the thing is that most enbies do seem to lean towards one binary gender over another, leaving those of us who are completely neither kinda a minority within the community
Ooofff, I've never seen my feelings being worded so eloquently. This is me exactly! I know I'm not a woman, but I also know I am not a man. Yet, if I HAVE to choose in this stupid binary system, I prefer the masculine choice. Yet I don't want to be either/or. Rather either/and/neither. Recently I've picked up the description: 'I want to be feminine the way gay guys can be'. It's not perfect, but it's something, I suppose. I just want to best of both world, dammit, let me be flat chested while wearing a killer fit. But then as soon as I show any interested in femininity, my brain tells me I'm just too scared of being a woman so I'm hiding in masculinity. Stupid gendernormativity 💀

Whoops, got a little carried away. Long story short, I feel you mate, haha. It's a big ball of wibbly wobbly messy wessy and it's confusing as heck.
i have no interest in stuff like that, it’s just really not for me
I think it's kind of inappropriate to armchair diagnose someone with a personality disorder in a completely unrelated sub. I've confirmed with a therapist and psychiatrist that I don't have BPD.
Just cause you don't want to be perceived feminine doesn't mean you need to be perceived masculine. That's why androgyny exists. I would love nothing more that to not be masculine or feminine. Even androgyny feels wrong sometimes
Same here for masculinity (I am amab). I am relatively sure that I am no woman, either though I hope I will know once I actually start HRT. Though I do not mind either my name nor the pronouns commonly used for me. I find it reassuring to, at least temporarily describe myself using negatives like agender and nonbinary. But expressing my gender and being percieved as androgynous (which can also be a identity btw) is the goal I am going for right now. Maybe I discover I am actually a woman once I am on hormones and if not I may get some clarity about what I actually am. But who knows? 

What I know is, that the core of masculinity is basically non-femininity. But there are recent constructs like caring or soft masculinities that integrate feminine traits into male role concepts. So it is really hard to dismantle what actually is at the core of masculinity and it is very loaded with power dynamics and structures. I think it may help you to try and dig through that to get a clearer picture what of your perception of gender is genuine and what might be internalised misogyny and/or self -hatred blurring the pictures.

I hope this kind of helps?!? I wish you all the best :)
What's your ideal scenario? For example I know NBs who have little to no fem quality to them but also refuse the label of ""man"". It does sort of demonstrate how inbuilt the binary is in society when we can't exist as ""not woman and not man"" with a full masc tilt.
It’s so complex. Amab here and I’ve similar feelings towards masculinity. But some good psychology sessions has helped me confirm what I’ve felt for a long time. That it’s society pushing the gender construct of what cis femininity and masculinity are that I’m perhaps most at odds with. I think one can ultimately still be happy sitting in a gender but it’s what you make of it and how you are perceived that’s important. But this can be very difficult due to societal programming. Personally I’m taking steps to “shift” into a more NB trans expression, but the binary world is strong.
You don’t have to be feminine to be non-binary.
I know plenty of feminine cis men!
❤️

im more like I want be an emo boy or femboy, but not a man. I'd choose masculine choice as well but because I'm AFAB maybe I'm afraid of being a man or identifying separate from feminine bc I'm afraid of men or the stereotypes of men but yeah sorry if I repeated things
Idk then, I don’t have any advice or anything useful. I hope you figure things out and are happy, sorry you're feeling like this
i didn't diagnose you with anything, I just said what it reminded me of, I'm sorry if it came off that way
Very well said. Finding your identify and being happy with it often includes dealing with internalized misogyny/misandry/transphobia/homophobia, etc. In my case, it took breaking away from what society perceives masculinity/femininity to be.
I wish the concept of masculinity and femininity were never even created. Makes me hate society as a whole.
I want to be masculine. If i could be perceived as a man i feel like i would be happy, but also being called a man, a boy, etc gives me the heebs. It’s very confusing
Yeah XD Androgyny only comes up as ""you don't have to be androgynous to be valid uwu"" Meanwhile I've yet to see any kind of positivity about androgyny/sex ambiguity to counteract the shit society gives us for it
Goals right there
What descriptions do you like? :)
[deleted]
That's awful :( I definitely relate hard to being made fun of for being naturally androgynous but then also for trying to conform to AGAB roles. Got a lot of homophobia for it as a teen. Since my medical transition, I find complete strangers will be so rude randomly :/"	qq5hpd	NonBinary	159	0.99	2021-11-09 14:59:43
I find xenogenders awesome. But are they genders? Thoughts?	"**BEFORE READING: Please don't use these comments to mock/hate on neopronouns/xenogenders and the people who identify with them. Ok? Cool.** 

I think that neopronouns and xenogenders are really interesting. I like that people are forgoing the usual ideas of gender in favour of something personal to them and their interests. For instance, somebody who holds a lifelong fascination with space might use moon/moonself, thereby associating their identity with something that they really enjoy. That's wonderful. 

With that, I feel like xenogenders are separate from the idea of gender entirely. From my understanding, the genders of man and woman (and additional genders of some cultures) stemmed from stereotypes about biological sex, and became a mutated set of ideals and aesthetics that we began to perpetuate. Long hair and flowers, beards and toolboxes and all that stuff. Since it's a social construct it has changed with time– pink used to be considered a boys' colour for its strength. 

From what people have told me and what I've seen, xenogenders and their respective neopronouns tend to stem from personal interests/associations/likes. They're less of a vague classification category like ""man"", and more of a way to refer to individual people. A new social construct that is similar to gender except it doesn't stem from stereotypes about biological sex. 

So would you consider xenogenders to be genders? Or something new and different, that perhaps deserves a different word? Does it depend on the individual?

I'd especially love to hear the opinions of people who **identify with a xenogender** here, but anyone's welcome to chip in."	"I understand them as a simile. Are you literally a dog when you're dog gender? No. But, I understand someone is trying to relate their gender to an idea. Gender is sometimes hard to get, especially if you're not in a binary category. I don't use them, but I've always joked I'm a cave goblin. I think if I used cave-goblin-gender, maybe it would help express things better? I don't know!
I don’t really get them. I wonder if it’s kind of like synesthesia, where smell means smell to me but means smell plus color to someone else.

It’s interesting to learn about though!
they don't make sense to me. you know what else doesn't make sense to me? quantum physics. doesn't make quantum physics any less real though. basically, we don't have to fully comprehend something or personally want to participate in it to acknowledge it can be useful to others. it did take me a while to understand that.

I do feel awkward using neopronouns to be honest because they're not part of how I normally use English and I don't know how to conjugate some of them. language changes often though, and it's nice to make people feel included. so I generally try as long as we're in an environment where I won't be endangering them by using the right pronouns, in which case it's always possible to reword your sentence so you don't misgender someone

I think there is potential for some people to get mixed up between their gender and their interests, but at the end of the day, that's their own journey to take. as long as they're not using it to mock trans people or spread misinformation it's all cool.

a lot of hate on xenogenders and the like seems to come from stuff that correlates e.g. there's a lot of social media posts by people who happen to use neopronouns where the subject happens to act in ways that are stereotypically ""cringe"" or seen as embarrassing, so then people kinda lump it together and see their gender as a causation rather than a correlation for their behaviour and come to the conclusion that their whole identity is ""cringe"" and embarrassing and everyone who identifies differently is bad. unfortunately this sort of thinking is quite common and is responsible for a lot of transphobia in general. even I have to consolidate my opinions and check for biases myself and I'm part of the community.
As an agender person, all genders are equally mystifying to me, so I don’t see why man/woman would be considered genders but xenogenders wouldn’t.
as a non-binary human who is comfy with that label, im not sure that my opinion on xenogenders really matters. if someone tells me that their pronouns are xe/xir or moon/moonself i will use those pronouns when referring to them, just like i would for anyone else
This may be a somewhat controversial take here, but I believe that gender is a concept that exists regardless of social norms and runs a lot deeper than interests or stereotypes about biological sex - I would say it probably has something to do with brain wiring. Interests also have no real bearing on gender - lots of women like traditionally masculine things but it doesn’t make them any less of women, same for men and feminine things. For me at least, I’m not NB because I like both masculine and feminine interests, I’m NB because of discomfort with some things intrinsically linked to my birth sex, like physical features. I know others may have a different experience and I respect that. However, if having interests typically associated with the opposite sex still doesn’t have any bearing on your gender identity, why would non-gendered interests come into it? I’d say gender can definitely be a spectrum, with some people not perceiving themselves as solely either male or female, but the concept of xenogenders seems like it’s referring to something else entirely.
I am a neopronoun/xenogender user. I do consider xenogenders

And for neopronons I personally prefer them over he/she/they because they fit me.Ive tried  other pronouns and this is what works the best.

My gender identity is nb/trans/xenogender.
I don't use the word xenogender to describe my gender but I'd probably fit in that category, I'm also black and autistic for context. But yeah, xenogenders are genders as much as any other genders are genders. Binary genders are associated with objects, aesthetics, and interests, races, cultures, abilities. Those things have been used to define genders, they are considered a part of what makes someone a gender or not, though they are not innate or inherent parts of a gender.
 
My understanding of gender is that it is both a thing you are and a thing you do. To me it makes sense that people would take their own objects, aesthetics, and interests, their race, their culture, their disabilities and make those into genders or associate those things with their gender or parts of it then name their gender after those things. Or base their pronouns off those things, as pronouns are a part how someone does their gender. They're expression, they can be used to denote gender or aspects of it and communicate that to others.
 
All of those things affect how someone experiences gender, how others gender you, and I think all of those things can be a part of how someone defines their gender. To me it's all the same thing, but rather than having the objects/aesthetics/interests imposed on them based on their ASAB/race/culture/disability or to chose them based on the gender category you fit into (man, woman, bigender, etc.) or archetype within that category (fem, twink, butch, stud, tomboy etc.) you are and someone might impose their own meaning (gender) onto their objects/aesthetics/interests/race/culture/disability in the process of understanding themselves and describing themselves to others. 

People can make their own genders. Some people are born with a static and innate sense of gender, others aren't. Neither has to contradict the other. Some people don't have an internal sense of gender, some people only do gender as an action. Some people do have an internal sense of gender but don't do that gender for any number of reasons, that is also okay. Ish, the fault is on people who make it unsafe for someone to do the gender they are in the way they want to/need to rather than the person who isn't doing their gender out of safety or other reasons. I think when someone is doing traditional gender or when someone is doing gender nonconformity they are doing that. They are taking their gender and using it as a lense to see through to understand themselves, other people, and themselves in relation to others as separate beings. Through their being and action they are creating their gender just like through being and action one creates themselves. 

I think it's silly to say ""that's not your gender that's just your personality"" with xenogenders or other non-binary genders because people with binary genders often do the same, their personality is as much their gender as they make it. They're just fitting into preexisting, well understood, and accepted categories. It's a situation where it's so normalized nobody thinks about it. So when someone does that but differently people see it as a thing but are blind to themselves doing it. I think most of the lateral aggression against against xenogenders is acceptability politics, internalized transphobia, or dysphoria projected onto others. Many trans people base the validity of their genders on it being innate, static, and most importantly not a choice so when people don't fit that mold they get defensive. Gender can be a choice, either to perform it (not necessarily whether or not you are the gender but that can be too tbh) or what that gender is.
 
If people are calling their genders genders then they're genders period, it doesn't need to be it's own word or category unless the people with those experiences decide to do that. This kinda feels like trender/transmed/true transsexuals discourse all over again, the ""these people are trans in a way that's different than me that I feel threatened by so they should call themselves something else or better yet we will call ourselves something else to distance ourselves from them and gain acceptance"". Which has yet to work. So. Yeah. Idk how much of that made sense but I hope it was useful to someone.
I think that gender is a social construct, in the way that it is ""made up""  but 100% real and with real life consecuences (for example: money is a social construct).

Now xenogenders are a level up from socially constructed binary genders because they are self made and with the purpose of self identification. It's like if two little siblings invent they're own language, it is real? yes absolutley, does it count? well...depends on personal opinion, I think there is no absolute answer because the way in which we communicate goes beyond rules and definitions. 

I don't use Xenogenders/neopronouns myself or know people who use them, but I will defend people who use them because I think it's cool when people define things in their own terms.
I consider xenogenders genders. It’s something integral and important to the person using that gender, so it’s respectful to use any neopronouns they may have and address them properly. For many people who identify themselves as a xenogender, they are neurodivergent, and it is a way they express the way they feel about themselves.
Gender is an internal sense of self. While we tend to gender many things, and perform gender to a certain extent, I still feel like gender exists outside of societal expectations. Gender nonconforming people are not the same as trans people even if they share the same AGAB, and present/behave closer to the binary gender opposite their assigned one. Just as I’m not a trans woman even though I’m AMAB, have done feminizing HRT, and incorporated women’s clothing, and makeup into my presentation
They are genders, they just relate the way they experience their gender to concepts that fall outside of the bimodal sex construct, like how many people experience being agender.
you have to understand that gender isn't one thing. it's the culmination of socialization, aesthetic, societal roles, personality, dress, interests, and identity.

the goal of liberation from gender is to strip all of that away and leave only identity, you are how you identify, and the way you look, act, and engage with society should have no say otherwise. 

so then are xenogenders an expression of identity? yes? then they are no different to gender in a society liberated from it. Furthermore they are very similar to gender even now, as xenogenders are labels people use to describe how they feel, and that is also reflected in how they socialize, dress, and present themselves. 

in practice and in theory, there is nothing to differentiate xenogenders from the concept of gender in the first place besides understanding and acceptance.
xenogenders were made in general because their identity didnt fit anywhere on the gender spectrum, so yes, Id say theyre genders
They sure as heck are
I find them really interesting, I respect all the xenogender and neopronoun pals :)
Yes they are
Yeah, genders gotta come from somewhere.
More accurate interpretation of gender then man/woman
This is based on my understanding of gender which is ""a set of roles in a group based on observable features"" 
So you have something like ""cat gender"" where the person looks at the social roles that a cat has, being a pet, being cold but in a cute way, and everything else and decides that they would live better in those roles, hence gender.
But when you get to ""man"" and ""woman"" as genders they are kinda a mess. There are so many things that make up either of those genders that saying ""my friend is a woman"" tells you basically nothing about how they dress, act, how their body looks, how they talk. The most you can really guess is that they probably want to be called a woman and therefore must fill at least some of the roles.
I'll explain more if there are any questions
I personally view xenogenders, especially my own ones, to be more detailed descriptors of my gender. They can be linked to my hyperfixations but they often are just metaphors and similes for my gender. They’re genders but in a different way than “normal”.
I think the distinction is kind of irrelevant. If people experience them in the same way others experience traditional genders then who am I to argue? 

I recently came to the realization that the problem I used to have with xenogenders and neopronouns was mostly therians/otherkin using them to try and insert themselves into the trans community. The only thing that actually bothers me any more is when someone expects people to learn all of their personalized genders/ pronouns.
I find it really odd that neopronouns have become linked with xenogenders when people discuss the topics. When I started transitioning, xenogender didn't exist as a word, the similar concept that was trending then was otherkin. It was considered quite offensive that it was being described as linked to being trans. Meanwhile neopronouns, like ze/hir/hirs/hirself and ey/em/eir/emself, although rare to find someone who used them, were clearly established as a concept among non-binary people and had been for a few decades. Just as another option to singular they or adapting it

No, I don't agree that xenogender is part of non-binary, nor by extension trans
from what i've gathered people who id with xenogenders have difficulties identifying with the gender binary in any form. for us gender doesn't make any sense. speaking from my own experience, idfk how i'm supposed to know my gender. nobody explained it to me. it doesn't make any sense, i don't get how people put themselves in those categories. for me it just makes more sense to identify with things i like than some random categories that i don't have a connection to. for me it is still a gender because it's something that i internally identify with and under circumstances also express outwardly. sure, it's different from the traditional idea of gender but i don't think the origin of the gender binary makes it more of a gender just because xenogenders came about differently?
xenogenders just feel like me and i get gender euphoria and gender envy from things that aren't people but it's still my gender...
Yeah, I consider them genders.  The only ones I have an issue with are when people use Fey/fae as a gender and/or pronoun.  I'm an Irish polytheist, and the Fey are literally my ancestral gods.  They're not just fanciful little creatures for people to identify with.  They're ancient, pre-Celtic ancestral spirits named the Tuatha de Denann, or Aos Sidhé, and they don't deserve to be reduced to a gender/pronoun.  So yeah, I get pretty salty when I see that because it's extremely disrespectful of my culture, and it's a way of continuing a cultural genocide that started over 1500 years ago.

Beyond that, or appropriating other cultures, I genuinely don't care what people go with.  Just don't use people's ancestral gods and spirits as genders & pronouns
Xenogendered pair of semi-feral, hyper-intelligent Dingos here!

And we'll preface it with the fact that we've never fully 'gotten' gender we think: But, gender to us is a bit of stereotyping, but we don't think it was necessarily based on biological sex, but reflective social and pragmatic roles from a time when communication and senses-of-self were much less-clear, and that biological sex got conflated in. (For example, ""man"" was the stronger, more active, more agressive role, and it just happens to be that statistically on-average, people with testosterone happen to be more of said things. Pre-colonialism many cultures had multiple 'genders' and people were allowed to float between them, perhaps with some misplaced hassles.)


But at least with our kind of social-role stereotype understanding, we'd say xenogenders are genders. It gets the short-hand point-of-expectations across, at least for us.


We're semi-feral; we might not react as conform'ative as people are used to. 

We're hyper-intelligent; this explains how we're communicating at-all.

We're dingos, canines; 

Do we wanna be pet? Yes!

Are we protective of family/pack? Yes!

Are we skittish? Better believe it.

Do we wanna eat you? Maybe~ Depends how hungry we are~ ;3


Not to say it's always effective in getting the point across... But that's on other people, get on our-level.
Do people use them as identifiers for their gender? Yes? Then they are genders
Theyre genders just as much as man/woman since those came about from... maybe not interests *specifically* but from what each sex was expected to do so like...  they did kinda come from interests, just on a much broader scale and, for the most part, werent smn you could opt out of easily for quite a lot of people, so the ""interests"" it was made around couldnt possibly cover eveyone of that gender. 

They dont have established gender *roles* tho, which may be where the disconnect is?
Yeah, I consider them genders. I believe that they're more like metaphors for gender expression, instead of literally believing you are something. And I enjoy that, I love the creativity and expression.

Gender is a social construct, so why not have fun with it? Even if I don't identify as one, people are free to express themselves however they like and I'm not one to judge.
as an autistic person, i know that xenogenders are typically used by neurodivergent people to express their relationship with gender and how they experience it. i don’t personally identify with any xenogenders, and i perceive them as more of an identification of one’s self as a whole, not just gender. i constantly relate to cats and consider my behavior to be very similar to cats but i do not identify with “catgender.” it’s not up to me to speak on behalf of the entire community and lay down the law on xenogenders, but that is my experience and familiarity with them!
I read your title as Xenogears (which is a video game) and I was incredibly confused for a few minutes.
I think it seems interesting but also i don't understand it. I've never met a neopronoun person and i can't say i relate to the idea. But whatever floats your boat. It's a shit world, whatever keeps u going another day. Personally, I'm a they/them. I do find it extremely fascinating when thinking about how AI will choose to identify itself, maybe it will use neopronouns?
For the exact reasons you named, my stance is also that most if not all xenogenders aren't genders. Are they valid? Obviously, as long as the person genuinely feels that way and isn't using the label for clout (which isn't anyone's call to make but their own anyway), yes, absolutely! But I'd definitely say that they are related, but still decidedly distinct from genders.
I am pangender/genderfluid, and that includes some xenogenders, and honestly they don't make sense to me either!

But I _can_ say is that whatever they are they feel like gender in the same way that feeling like a demi-man or feeling like a woman does. I also feel a gender sometimes and that's a distinct (lack of) feeling from feeling a xenogender.

On the other hand, there are some reported xenogenders that I do not personally experience. For example, I don't have a sense of my neurodivergence as a gender, nor do my personal interests feel very gender to me. But hey, I have a hard time expressing what my xenogenders are like, so I shouldn't be surprised when other people's xenogenders are also difficult to describe!

So overall, I would say that xenogenders are not a separate thing entirely from gender, although it can seem that way if you don't have an internal experience with that xenogender. That is, personal interest (or whatnot) is the closest analog that anybody has to try and describe it without just falling back onto the term gender again, but it's a poor match.

I made a post elsewhere recently about this that goes into more detail. I'll see if I can pick it up, but I am on mobile so we'll see lol
I would think that xenogender is different from gender. I honestly don’t see how it works for people who identify as xenogender, since it sounds like it comes from stuff they like or something. I’m not saying that I hate them. I’m saying I don’t understand how they become xenogender, which might be a bit rude, tbf. It seems to be a whole complete new catagory apart from gender
I like the *idea*, but I don't understand how you would use the pronouns in a regular scenario, as some people use nouns as pronouns, and using those pronouns could make it sound like you are talking about the object. I am fine with people prefering them tho
I agree that it doesn't use the common vocabulary. Gender means a specific thing in our society, even though it is hard to get. It traditionally is not associated with stars or moons or aliens etc. So that can create confusion. It is not something that I would be comfortable to express my identity as.
I use Fae/Faer/Faers neoprouns
I think it depends on the person, as a nonbinary but not xenogender
Yeah they're more like gender presentations
Well, The Million Dollar Question To Answer This Is, ""What Is A Gender?"", And Alas I Can't Say I Know The Answer To That, So, Are Xenogenders Genders? I Don't Know.
i would say i am xenogender.

like i feel very gender euphoric when i wear elf ears, or wear fairy wings, or overall dress and accessorize with stuff that’s similar to illustrations of dark fairies. i also feel a really strong connection to mermaids and sirens, usually drawing myself as one gives me gender euphoria. 

i will say i’m not very well educated on it. but i definitely see xenogenders as other genders. i am a firm believer that non-binary is an umbrella, and to find euphoria and identity within non-human things sounds very much non-binary to me.

i personally just feel more comfortable identifying as the umbrella term non-binary rather than fairygender or mermaidgender, but that’s just because i deal with enough scrutiny from people for being enby, i don’t want to deal with more confused and judgmental people.
They’re at least as real as men and women, just less common. I find all of it equally incomprehensible, but figure that there must be an instinct people who have gender(s) have that I don’t that currently doesn’t have any possibility to be articulated in any concrete way.
I disagree. I have a really hard time grasping my identity and that includes choices I could make to present myself to society. Before I understood xenogenders, choosing clothes, a hairdo or even the way I talk to people was hard. With autism and masking I just mimic so many people idk what's me and what's not.

But with my xenogenders now it kinda gives a mood or a tint to whatever social tool I need to choose from, colors of my clothes, patterns, style, or hair or also the way I carry myself.

Xenogenders are for me a great social tool to help me comprehend how I wanna be since and exist in society because yes, it is a construction even if it's tied to my personality it's kinda the way I choose to present it to the world.

Sending ghost hugs to all xenos out there
I don’t think they are genders. The best explanation I’ve seen comes from a now-deleted tiktok of someone responding to a commenter who said “everyone always says ‘gender is a social construct’ until it comes to (xenogenders).” She responded with:
“When people say ‘gender is a social construct’ to defend xenogenders it shows they don't understand what a social construct is.
Social constructs are socially decided, not individually decided.
A social construct is very real, but its existence is dependent on our collective belief in its existence. This include borders, governments, laws, holidays, language.
Countries are a social construct. Does this mean I can just make up a country and claim to be a legimate citizen of that country? No, I'm an American citizen, whether I feel that way or not.
Money is a social construct. Does this mean I can buy groceries with monopoly dollars? Does this mean currency has no basis in material reality? No.
The English language is
a social construct. Does this mean I can
start speaking in gibberish and expect people to understand what the fuck I’m saying?
Gender is the same.
Gender is defined as the ‘social and cultural differences rather than biological ones’ pertaining to sex.
In most of the world today, there are two culturally prescribed aesthetics and expectations and behaviors, masculinity and feminity, that comprise gender.
When you go shopping for clothing, there is a men's section and a women's section, and any ‘gender neutral’ clothing is just vaguely masculine.
These concepts are outdated.
Instead of inventing even more arbitrary social boxes, we should dismantle the concept of gender entirely.
Without gender, biological sex would have zero social relevence. It is just blank-slate, neutral psychological traits and functions pertaining to reproduction.”

This makes the most sense to me of any analysis of xenogenders I’ve seen before. And before someone says something, the original poster wasn’t a TERF, she includes trans people in her definition of gender.
I think I fully agree with this take. Cause when talking about gender it's about the subconscious felt sense. Man and woman genders are what the subconscious has conceptualized/maped out about the physical body (trans would then be having a different map) and all the xenogender are just our subconscious conceptualization of those things

I would say that with this concept of xenogender we have been doing it for a long time. think the lady of the lake the lady of the moon ect. Wolf born... Native Americans had spirit animals- functionally similar in concept. Probably a lot more that I can't think of off the top of my head. 

I like this take but then it kinda begs the question. Why are we calling it xenogender and why did we remove this natural tradition from our society?
I'm a former xenogender user. I never considered them genders, but instead just descriptors for your gender. Meaning someone who's catgender isn't a cat (obviously) but they're gender can be described similarly to cats
I don't use a xenogender (I don't have a gender at all lmao), but I've heard that xenogenders are more like a description of a person's gender when other things don't quite fit. if that's true I think they would logically be genders.

they're not genders based on words people typically associate with gender, but they're being used to describe how a person's gender *feels*. if a person's gender is female because they feel like a girl, then logically a person's xenogender would be a gender in the same way. it's described differently, but it still describes the same thing. if it's describing your gender then it's gender
id consider them genders. i feel like feeling like a 'man' 'woman' or just any gender can have a feeling to it, but often the feelings are hard to explain. identifying as an xenogender means that that person can put words to a feeling they have towards their gender and associate them with real things like space or cats or colours and that can help communicate their inner feeling to others!
They’re genders. Genderqueer identity is all about redefining what “gender” is, as the current ideas we have of it uphold patriarchal (and many other intersections of oppression) standards.   
Xenogenders are genders.
Chaosgender is a xenogender that basically is when your gender is all and none at the same time, scattered, hard to understand, and just overall loud and confusing. I identify with that a lot, aswell as staticgender which is when your gender is fuzzy like tvstatic, and glitchgender which is kind of like your gender feeling glitchy like it's buffering or something.
It's much like how people associate the moon with womanhood & use she/her pronouns for it. It's a giant rock in space but it just gives people woman vibes. They just have the word ""woman"" to go with on the day to day.

My gender is associated with colorful stones by the vibes of those objects, I just didn't come pre-packaged with a more accepted word for this so I took one recently made for it, Jewelboy. Instead of giving gems my pronouns, I use jewel/jewelself.
goblingender is actually an already existing xenogender, you might wanna check it out!
That’s a good way to describe it, I like that
that’s actually a really interesting way of looking at it. i have synesthesia, and as someone who isn’t xenogender maybe this will help me better understand it
Let me give you an example? Let's say you see yourself as someone rather distant, cold, a bit dark but with warm spot here and there for people you love and stuff you like, you may find it easier to encompass your person as space gender or star gender for example, because you feel mostly full of void and unseen things with bright burning spots of creativity like stars here and their.

It's kinda like describing yourself but with poetry somehow.
“They don’t make sense to me. You know what else doesn’t make sense to me? Quantum physics.” 

Literally going to start using this as my comeback to anyone trying to invalidate me lol
To your point about people who identify with xenogenders acting stereotypically cringe or embarrassing- I think that perception has a lot to do with ableist attitudes towards neurodivergent people, particularly people on the autism spectrum. Autistic people are a lot more likely to be trans and a lot more likely to identify outside the gender binary than neurotypicals, and they are also a lot more likely to feel that genders like “man” and “woman,” with all their clusters of arbitrary traits and behaviors, don’t make sense. Unfortunately, people tend to view some of the ways that autistic people might behave, speak, or express themselves as “cringe.” I’m not on the spectrum, but as someone with ADHD, I’ve definitely felt like some of my natural tendencies (interrupting without noticing or meaning to, fidgeting, pretty much only talking about the same 3-4 things that I’m currently fixated on, crying easily), are seen as rude, childish, or embarrassing.
you vocalized everything i’ve had trouble trying to, lol. you phrased this amazingly, well done! 🙏🏼🙏🏼
There a quantum gender, it's when your gender is never where you expect it to be and try to observe it. I find it's a clever way to encompass an elusive fluid gender haha, xenogenders can be a great way to explore gender with humour and poetry I love it
A xenogender is a metaphor more than anything.
I don't hate on neopronouns & such. But I do sometimes wonder, most people have trouble remembering your name the first time they meet you, even the first few times. It seems like introducing a new category that the general population is not used to, I just wouldn't expect a lot of people to remember. Not out of maliciousness, but just habit.
So what neopronouns do you use?
This is a really well thought out answer. I’ve identified as a xenogender for a while (monstergender or something close to it, like fantasygender) but have always been afraid to share that for fear of being either labeled transphobic and/or as appropriating trans culture. I am also non-binary, as well. Thank you for this answer.
i really like what you said about gender being both what you are and what you do. i often feel like i have an internal gender but the gender i ""do"" is different
This is something I am coming to terms with myself. And it makes the use of pronouns really difficult at time. Personally I feel fluid so I go back and forth in the way I present. Some days I may want to use she/her but I also accept the reality that I don’t have the experience of a woman even when I do cross dress. Really I just want to be acceptable as myself and part of that was casting away the gender binary entirely. Just being me what ever that means in that moment
[deleted]
“something that i internally identify with and under circumstances also express outwardly”

I really like that
I feel you about never really “getting” gender. And I enjoyed your perspective– the social-role aspect is something I hadn’t considered much, really interesting.

You seem super cool, here’s a little snack for u :D 🥩
Aww this is awesome, i love this so much
All the good vibes to you! I’m a lot more feline-oriented in my expression but I can relate to a lot of this.
HA i love that
We don’t become xenogender. We find these labels and go “that makes sense! I like that!”   
Xenogenders are about euphoria, not dysphoria.
Okay, this is the one that gets under my skin.  The Fey are literally my ancestral gods, and they do not deserve to be reduced to a piece of a human's identity.  They're not fanciful creatures for folks to play around with; they're Irish ancestral gods and spirits.  While our spirituality is an open path, the Sidhé do not deserve to be disrespected and reduced like that.  The name of my gods' species is not a frivolous title, and to disrespect it as such is a continuation of cultural genocide that started over 1500 years ago.
I’m not sure how you expect to dismantle gender without expanding the ways people are “allowed” to identify. In my experience, a lot of people criticize trans/nb and other gender diverse people heavily for “enforcing gender roles” when they are creating new space or terms for themselves, rather than focusing on the actual oppressive system of (cis)gender. 

This leads to people being criticized for being regressive when they are going AGAINST the status quo in a manner visible to the outside observer, while at the same time largely ignoring the people who assimilate into the main cis-normative culture. I don’t find this take very helpful.
That’s really interesting. Thank you for sharing. To me that sounds like how someone would describe their temperament, essence, or maybe even their soul. So that’s an interesting use of gender that I hadn’t really considered. Makes a bit more sense to me now!
Oh that's such a lovely way of wording it! Thank you for this - I have always accepted and respected xenogenders but this explanation allows me to understand it myself and that's such a wonderful thing to share. Thank you ❤️
I use it/doll/bun/pony/ne/vamp/king/dolphin/Dragon/that/thing/leaf/wave 
 I’m pronounfluid.
Good luck moving forward. I had a hard time figuring out my gender, and spent 2 decades grappling with if I was a cis man or trans woman. Being able to separate my gender from my physical self, and the physical self that I felt I should have was a learning experience but my life has improved after coming to understand my gender
https://www.healthline.com/health/gender-nonconforming

You can be gender nonconforming, and be trans but you could also be cis
thanks :)
thanks :)
Well, yeah. I know that finding your gender or sexuality can bring more euphoria.
i don’t know much about this topic so apologies if i’m missing something, but i’m wondering why using a god as a pronoun is automatically a reduction? i read your sentence “they do not deserve to be reduced to a piece of a human’s identity”, but i guess that doesn’t fully explain it for me, especially since religion/spirituality is subjective and using fae pronouns doesn’t usually mean you’re trying to call yourself a god
I am a Fae. That is why i use those pronouns.
We gave them the name “fae”. They did not choose that and many would argue they’re indifferent to that name, some even offended by it. Besides, majority of people who use fae/faer pronouns aren’t comparing themselves to the fae. 

Not to mention, there are people who believe they are otherkin and that they are fae reborn in a human body.
It seems like you think this is somehow about trans men and women? I’m quoting someone, first off. Take it up with them. Second, this is commenting on whether xenogenders are genders. Not in any way policing feminine trans men or masculine trans women or non-binary people (all who challenge gender by defying their assigned gender role). You’re trying to question me… but I’m curious how exactly you think identifying as catgender dismantles gendered expectations when it has no bearing on any of the components of the social construct of gender
Okay. People are allowed to identify however they want, of course. I’m not saying anyone isn’t allowed to identify as whatever. However, identity alone doesn’t necessarily have any bearing on material conditions. It’s not subversive in any way, not aiding in dismantling the societal construct of gender if people identify with xenogenders, because xenogenders by definition are entirely disconnected from concepts of masculinity, femininity, and gender neutrality. It’s not as if people who identify with xenogenders, for example, become actual fairies, so they are still bound by the accepted definitions of gender regardless of how they identify. What is subversive and what does dismantle gender is homosexuality and gender-non conformity. Even a cis woman choosing not to have children is rejecting the gender role assigned to her based on her sex and thereby working to dismantle gender. Again, I’m NOT talking about personal gender identity, I’m talking about how gender is viewed in society. Because the idea of gender accepted in cis society is linked to sex, even binary trans people subvert gender— as much as the assimilationists would like to think they don’t.
I'm glad it helps, I honestly do not know how to explain it differently at the moment myself.
I love your pronouns so much!!
So do you just let people call you whichever of those they want?
Wow those are cool! I especially like Dragon
Generally from what I’ve seen, when it comes to spirituality regarding the fae most practicing people are very open to those who use fae/faer pronouns. 

The few times I’ve seen someone be uncomfortable with certain pronouns are when the pronouns are straight up god/godself pronouns, which I could understand having some discomfort about I guess.
No, I was talking about xenogenders as well. Also you posted the quote because you agree with it, as far as I can tell. 

Not trying to fight you or anything but I find the opinion you posted to be a bit reductive for the above reasons.
The quote you posted was in response to xenogenders, so I came to the conclusion you (slash whoever you took the quote from) were considering them a part of the “arbitrary social boxes” the person you copy-pasted from was railing against. Meaning part of the oppressive system of gender, but somehow at the same time not truly part of gender because xeonogenders don’t have basis in sex. If that is incorrect, I apologize, but that is what appears to mean.

I would argue that this shows how arbitrary the sexual basis truly is, when people can form similar identities based off of other characteristics. Regardless of how the outside observer may perceive the individual, I believe that dressing, acting, or even considering oneself completely outside the binary (trinary, whatever) gender system counts as gender non-conformity. Identifying as transgender or homosexual doesn’t necessarily translate to material reality either, until the person acts on it.
I prefer it/that/thing but yes anyone they want.
Well yeah I agree with the quote but that doesn’t mean I know how OP would answer your specific questions.
No xenogenders are arbitrary social boxes, but they’re not relevant enough that they need to be rallied against at this point. If they became integrated into the social construct of gender, then they’d warrant destruction.
So if you prefer those three why do you leave it open to all the others? I'm just curious, never met a neopronoun user irl.
Thanks for making your opinion clear.
I use any of them I like them all those three are my favorite. Idk if this makes sense.
That does make sense. Do people in your life actually use them correctly? I notice a lot of those are nouns and I bet it's kinda hard to wrap one's head around using a noun as a pronoun. I hope this isnt offensive to you but is there a reason that you seem to gravitate towards words used for objects in other contexts?

(OC) I wanted to create a series of enamel pins that combined gender and sexual identity pride colours into a simple rainbow shape, and this was the final design! My Non-binary Pride rainbow enamel pin badges!		"I need the enby pan one immediately
These are awesome I wish there was a enby/lesbian flag one
Beautiful!
Love these! Just put an order in 🏳️‍🌈
Where do I put an order in??
I wish I liked nb flag colors better :( I understand why they are, but I don't like how the yellow goes with the dark purple, just not my aesthetic) I love my psn flag tho
ahh yes the four sexualities, bi, pan, asexual, and... rainbow

/nblesbianconfusedface.jpg
You don't happen to ship to Germany, do you? Because the nb pan one is calling my name.

Edit: Just checked out your shop, you deliver to Germany, and I LOVE YOUR SHOP.

Now I'll have lace lockers for me, for one of my friends (her birthday is in july and I feel like she'd love the rainbow ones), and the pin that was calling my name.

Your shop is freaking AWESOME.

I'm going to spend way too much of my money there over time, but I'm ok with that.
I want the bi enby one.

Edit: it arrived and it's amazing.
Ohhh I love this! I love this a lot! It's all so powerful and aesthetically pleasing, what a great concept!
!remindme 12 hours

I need it so much so I'll try and convince my parents to buy this for me when they're both home, I love the design <3
I love the colour scheme in that combination! It's so bright and happy!
Yes!! I’m definitely going to add this to the mix!
Thank you so much! <3
Woo! Aw thank you! You'd be the first IN THE WORLD to get one!!!

Neopronouns	"I use neopronouns and I have been seeing tiktoks and tweets about how neopronouns are ""internet-made"" and that only children use them. I am 17 years old and I still use xe/xim neos. They make me feel secure and happy with my identity but these things make me feel like I'm lying to myself. What are your takes on neopronouns?"	"I am from Latinamerica and I saw a sign on a Pride event that read ""Cisgender straight men dont care about pronouns until you call em ""sis""  
I was rolling on the floor laughing.  
Im 42 and started using them for fun ... and every day I use em more and more.  
LOVE IT.
I don't understand neo pronouns (I stick with They/Them myself) but the best part about this is I don't have to! Just like I don't have to understand how people are satisfied by the gender binary, or like mustard. Anyone who says something invalidating about them or refuses to use them is spending an odd amount of time and energy hating something. It's pretty hard for me to think they're anything but enbyphobic.
Neopronouns predate the internet. ""Thon"" is a neopronoun that is over a century old and still in use.
> neopronouns are ""internet-made"" and that only children use them

Even if that were true, which it's not, so what? Where do people think words come from? Every single word we have was invented by someone at some point. And guess what? Children grow up!

Of all the gatekeeping bullshit, why this. I just don't understand. OP, if you feel comfortable with neopronouns, that's literally all that matters. Gatekeeping assholes don't deserve a nanosecond of your time.
I'm 40 and agender and used them for a while when I was figuring shit out (ze/zir xe/xir) and that was my late 20s-30s so like, when you were 6.
Maybe not necessary in the English language since we have they/them, but in gendered languages I think they're absolutely necessary.

In French, I use iel, which is a neopronoun (huge thanks to whoever came up with it!). In Italian, I use loro (which means ""they""). In Greek, I only use my name.

I really wish Greek and Italian had neopronouns
As long as you feel safe using them and they make you happy, that’s all that matters.
my take on neopronoun is i don't care because it's none of my businss!!Use them if you find comfort in them 😚
I'm 38 and as far as I'm aware, neo-pronouns predate the internet. I definitely remember xim/xer from high school.
I’m 21 and use ze/zir (xe/xir) neopronouns, and I’m cool with pretty much any xenopronouns. Are they “internet-made?” Not all of them, but yes most of them are. Do lots of children use them? Yeah. Who cares though? They’re new, obviously they got popular on the Internet and with the youth. So what?

Also the concept of neopronouns is absolutely not new. The proposal of “Thon” the neopronoun “ze/hir” and even the usage of “they” as a singular far predate the modern “trend.”
I don't understand then I'm the slightest, but when someone asks me to use them I will, no questions asked. Just do whatever makes you happy
I’ll be completely honest, I don’t understand them. I understand the idea of them but I don’t understand them. However I will still use them for someone who wants me to because they’re valid and I’m not going to be an asshole to someone who’s facing the same struggles I do.
Honestly I would like to use neopronouns but every time I think about it I chicken out. It’s going to be hard enough to get my family to call me by alternate pronouns they’re already familiar with, I’m just too tired and self-conscious to add another layer on top of that. I feel like neopronouns are something that might take a century to fully be accepted if they ever are. The problem with neopronouns is that there are only a handful that are common but the whole concept revolves around creating pronouns that fit you. Which is great in a utopian world where everybody accepts you and remembers those things but when there’s no standard to go off of and anyone can make anything up, most English-speaking people just won’t bother to memorize something that’s not standardized. I feel like we should start with one neopronouns then add more over a very long time. That’s just how language works, things slowly changing in small ways over long periods of time, not everything all at once. 

It’s a shame but I get why it’s having such a hard time catching on.
Respectfully, 17 is still a child to me BUT I don't think young people using neopronouns or them being popular online in any way invalidates them. I see it as a clue to the direction in which society is leaning for the future. Overall it is much more positive for us to be becoming more free in the way we self-identify than it would be if all the kids were suddenly encouraging binary gender and all the 'norms' that come with that. Put simply, its progress, the rest of the world will catch up so don't worry about how adults perceive you.
I studied linguistics on my first go through undergrad. People have always invented words as they need them. Literally always. Since the dawn of spoken language. A human looks at a thing and thinks ""we need a way to refer to that thing. I'll call it X"" and a new word is born. 

Hell, the word ""internet"" itself didn't exist til sixty years ago or so. So why is ""internet"" a valid word but neopronouns aren't simply bc they gained traction *on* said internet? That's such a stupid argument.

All that said, I'm in the camp of ""I don't really Get neopronouns"" - I honestly think they're a little silly, we've had perfectly serviceable they/them sitting right here for the last several centuries, so why did we need a bunch of other sets to mean essentially the same thing? - and like others have mentioned I tend to forget bc my memory is a filing cabinet that's been set on fire, and I default to they/them when I can't remember. But I still do my best to respect them if I'm talking to someone who uses them bc in the end, they're not my pronouns and I don't really *need* to ""get"" them to use them for someone.
I'm 26 and use them. 🤷🏻
Can’t say I really understand them, I sometimes find it hard for I switch my brain away from the way society raised me to view gender and the centrist anti sjw phase I went through a few years ago. Im definitely a little confused by some of them. That being said if that’s how you feel most comfortable, then nothing else really matters. Your identity and experience is valid and deserves to be respected. It’s not really any of my business who uses what pronouns. It’s definitely not just kids. I have a non-binary college teacher who goes be xe/xim/xer I think.
People making attack helicopter jokes have no right to be dragging you down. You deserve to use what makes you comfortable
Do a google search on “history of neopronouns.”
The idea is them has been around in the English language for hundreds of years. I’m middle aged and grew up as the internet was being born. I first heard  xe/xim when I was your age, way before social media caught on. They are not new and anyone who says sk is just ignorant.
There have been ideas for neopronouns tossed around since the 19th century, whoever says they were invented on the Internet needs to do a little research
If neopronouns are the pronouns that make you most comfortable, use them. Also, try not to take much stock in what’s said on tiktok and twitter. They’re echo chambers of horrible, radicalized ideas. I love meeting people with neos, they’re always really cool
all pronouns are made up. if ppl are mad abt ppl identifying outside of the binary they are spreading cis  bullshit and need to take a look at themselves
I feel you on this, I use they/xe pronouns and I'm very comfy with neopronouns. I think from what I heard, the neopronouns ""thon"" came way before the Internet
I don’t use neopronouns but if someone tries to shit on them or on the people who use them then send them my way… I just wanna talk.
I use Neopronouns. I use common & ""Internet Made"" ones too. They make me happy & they are cute & pretty. People are just mean & stupid sometimes. I hope you're doing ok! Cheers Mate!
People need to stop getting so upset by them. Acting like it’s some massive deal.

Let people use whatever pronouns make them comfortable.
They're just another way to express gender in a way that's comfortable for you, I use fae/fem neopronouns myself ^_^
Ppl will always find something to call ""stupid"" and ""made up"". Some transfobes think pronouns în general are made up and only children who are ""confused"" use them. Which is obviously not true. So, like, all that ""neopronouns are stupid"" stuff is just transfobia (internalized, if it comes from trans ppl) and cringe culture. Which should be dead. Those ppl are just insecure, don't mind them ;)

Also neopronouns are fckin dope! I don't use them for myself, but I think they are super cool :3 I have an OC who uses xe/xem x)
tldr: Dunking on neopronouns is simple transphobia and willful ignorance. People should just stfu if they're about to make fun of something but haven't done any fact-checking.

What follows is what I was able to find quickly and easily, having not studied the history of neopronouns at all:

---

I was under the impression that xe/xem and ze/zir were created in the late-70s or maybe the 80s... and yep! Seems like those tiktoks and tweets are easily debunked as misinformation.

In fact, it only took a moment to find [this etymology for xe/xem](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/xe#Etymology): 

>  Don Rickter (the pronoun appeared in the Unitarian Universalist publication UU World on 1 May 1973 and Mario Pei gave Rickter credit on page 145 of his 1978 book Weasel Words).

Then, I found an article from [illonois.edu](https://blogs.illinois.edu/view/25/705317), which goes through a long history of gender-neutral pronoun thinking in English going back to 1542. It it, it states that:

> Mill didn’t coin a pronoun to correct this defect, but in 1864, a writer identified only as J. W. L. came up with gender-neutral ze and recommended getting Noah Webster to endorse his coinage. That would prove a problem, because Webster had died in 1843.

but the modern ze pronouns trace back to 1973:

> Heer, hiser, and himer have been invented, and ignored, multiple times. So has ze, which copped a spot in the prestigious Oxford English Dictionary. Unfortunately, the OED missed that first ze in 1864. The dictionary only tracks ze back to 1972.

That article only mentions ze/hir. However, the Oxford English Dictionary in [2019 added zir](https://public.oed.com/updates/new-words-list-march-2019/), though unfortunately oed.com seems to be behind a paywall T.T so I couldn't confirm a latest-possible coinage date from a quote.

And anyway, so what if they come out of the internet? Lot's of things are inventions of the internet, like tiktok and twitter (not that they're super-great, but...), or easy access to solid information on a variety of topics. Remember when you had to go to the card catalog in your local library and spend hours searching by-hand for something covering the topic you're interested in, only to realize the book you think you need is only held in a library out-of-state, and then only after days of hunting it down it turns out not to be what it seemed? Neither do I, thank god!

And anyway-anyway, so what if only kids use them? That used to be tiktok and twitter, and even computers! Give it ten years and all the kids who are using neopronouns today will be fully-functioning neopronoun-weilding adults... as long as nobody is able to beat you down. They'll only add to the adults who are already using neopronouns, like Tula: whom I found out about from a quotation on wiktionary

> 1997 ... A case in point is Tula, a transgendered woman who for years lived well as a model and actress until ze was outed in both national and international media.

who I presume was already using ze/hir or ze/zir among friends well before the book was written, and therefore before the internet as we know it today.
Love em. They are also older than the internet as some others have said. Rock on kid!
I think the stuff you saw was probably about cat!/catself type of pronouns. Not the ze, xer, eim etc.
Neopronouns are completely valid! I know plenty of adults who use them. One of my friends, who’s 22, recently discovered that zey/zem is zeir favorite set of pronouns, and I somewhat know someone in their early thirties who uses xe/hir pronouns. And there are pronouns like thon, which as others have said, are centuries old! You’re completely valid, no matter what some jerk might say.
Honestly, it doesnt matter how they were made up, all words are made up. If a word doesnt exist that properly describes something, we make one. Neopronouns r awesome and valid, dont let anyone convince you otherwise. Ive genuinely considered adding a neopronoun set to my list just because i like the sound of them lol, and whatever is your reason for using them, its valid.
Neo-pronouns being internet made is false. Some neo-pronouns have been used in writing since the 1900s as a new form of gender neutral terms. So they're totally valid
All words are made up sounds to communicate ideas. All of them. Regardless of whether they were pre internet or not. Use what makes you feel best.
I love neopronouns!
I personally think that neopronouns are very valid and I personally use they/them and any neopronouns. I want them to be normalized more and hope that others understand them better. I also just feel comfortable with them.
i personally don’t use them for myself, but i have no problem with them for others who want to use them. it took me a bit to understand them, but once i looked into the history it made sense to me. most people don’t always realize neopronouns have been used for so long and provide gender neutral pronoun options for languages that don’t have them.
I was at a planned parenthood rally and there was a person there who was in their 30s and used neo-pronouns! Neo-pronouns are for everyone
It’s pretty epic that neopronouns make you feel that way and if they make you feel that we way then don’t stop. It ain’t harming anyone it’s just nice uvu
all words are made up. make up words that feel good to you! something being made on the internet doesn't make it less valuable, and *most* things are made on the internet these days. I don't personally enjoy neopronouns, but so the fuck what? they're your pronouns, not mine. these people are assholes and you can safely ignore them.
honestly, i use they/them, but it doesn’t feel quite right. it’s still way better than he/him or she/her, but it’s not quite settled yet. i feel like Neos would probably be good for me, but in this society, it’s too much of a hassle when people already barely handle they/them, so i just don’t fuck with it
Nearly all the most common neopronouns are oooooold! They've certainly been popularised online, but have been around since at least last century, and in some cases much longer!
Don't listen to those dumbasses. they are annoyed people who hate change. Slay.
Lol they’re dumb, and should really get in established queer spaces. I’m 23 almost 24 and I use xe/xem/xyr(s) alongside they/them. (Non-queer spaces are not ready for neopronouns.)
Never quite stuck right on me but they're very based on other people
Check out Leslie Feinberg, author of ""Stone Butch Blues"" (free to download on hir website), used zie/hir pronouns! (And she+he depending on context!) People who argue that neopronouns are ""internet-made"" need to get off the internet and read a book for real lol. 

So much of LGBTQ+ history is forgotten, our complex relations to the gender binary have always existed! 

I think neopronouns are great, I personally use they/them and xe/xem.
i am 25 and collect neopronouns at this point! my main pronouns are fae/faer, but i’m fond of a bunch of them. i don’t think this is “childish” or something to grow out of. there are examples of people in queer history who used neopronouns throughout their lives, so you’re in good company. and the people who care will use the right pronouns.
If they make you feel secure in your identity then you're free to use them as they represent you. But be aware that they can be difficult to use in English as they're quite new so most are gonna need help with learning how to use them. Especially with less common neopronouns. I find them difficult to use but I'd be willing to learn and practice if someone wanted me to use them was willing to help me. The issue I have with it is when people expect others to automatically know how to use them, and get offended when others aren't show how they work and refuse to respectfully teach others about how they work. The problem isn't with the pronouns but with the person and their attitude.
Language is an evolving medium; it’s fluid. We create words to describe feelings and things that we haven’t until recently been able to understand. Neopronouns are 100% valid. As we change and learn to understand ourselves, the words we use should reflect that. At the end of the day, it’s all just noises that cause hairs in our ears to send electricity to the blob of Jello that calls itself a brain.
As a they/them user in their late 20s, my take is that you're going to get pushback and eye rolls either way, so do what makes you the happiest.
Maia Kobabe, a graphic novelist and according to google, American cartoonist, uses E/Em/Eir neopronouns. Ey (or E, I don't use Spivak so I apologize for any misunderstandings) are 31 years old.
It makes you feel secure and happy. 

That’s it
That’s all that matters

I actually thought they were silly when I was younger and have gotten over it as I’ve gotten older
One of things I don’t understand, but that’s ok because I don’t need to. Why should I attempt to take something from you that makes a difference to you and no difference to me?
Do what makes you happy so long as you aren’t hurting anyone
Even if it’s internet made if it works for you genuinely then it works for you genuinely
[I made a video on my take\~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKqmKpAewos)
Neopronouns are valid :) personally I don't use them, but I support those who do

Edit: and all words are ""made up"" at some point, just because neopronouns were created more recently doesn't mean they're any less valid than he/him, she/her and they/them
I’m fine with neopronouns up to a certain extent. Those that follow the format of the language and fit well are perfect. Ones like xe/xem, e/em, fae/faer, etc. I’ve always considered using neopronouns but never found any that fit. The only ones I don’t really like are nounself pronouns. And it’s a really hard thing to disagree with because I understand the struggle with dysphoria and finding something that makes you feel euphoric. But to a certain extent they’re too much. I’ve seen things like bunself, voidself, enderself, dreamself (after the minecraft YouTuber). It feels like they’re just cutesy or edgy nicknames at this point. Maybe they work online but I have no idea how you’d use those types of pronouns in everyday conversation. It also feels like neopronouns as a whole get bashed because of those. I think those types of pronouns are really clunky and hard to integrate. And I think that’s what people are referring to when they’re upset about neopronouns.
neos are over 100 years old! the oldest one was thon
Neopronouns aren’t for me, tbh. I would rather go by they/them or a common set of catch-all gender neutral exclusive pronouns, even though such a set doesn’t exist as of yet. I still respect people who use neopronouns, though it’s hard for me to remember their pronouns at any given moment. I find it much easier to refer to anyone who I am unsure about with they/them pronouns, or just use their name (which is clunky and I would rather avoid that).

I think the concept of neopronouns is flawed. If everyone in the world decided they wanted a set of neopronouns for themselves, it would be very difficult to remember them all, in addition to their name and all the other stuff you gotta remember about a person (this is coming from someone who forgets birthdays so often that they have to put them in a virtual calendar). It isn’t practical in the long run, unfortunately.
Neopronouns?! 😡I’ll tell YOU how I feel about “NEOpronouns”.

👍🏻
The only people I know IRL who use neopronouns are older than me and I’m 31. Edit: Becky Chambers has written some future sci-fi books where the nonbinary characters use neopronouns, they’re fun books but all the nonbinary characters are aliens which is a bit disappointing. Still worth a read IMHO. “A long way to a small angry planet” is the first one in the series.
I'd Say All Pronouns Were Pretty Much Just Made Up Randomly, So Why Should It Matter If That Was 5000 Years Ago Or 5 Years Ago? As Long As People Use Them They're Real, That's How Language Works.
I don’t mind em. I stick with they/them because it’s what works for me. Other neopronouns like Eir/Em, Xe/Xir or Zey/Zir might feel off in conversation but honestly if someone asks me to use them, that’s cool. 100% will do and will be very sorry if I screw up.

Now, if you say, use something like kitten/kittenself or tree/tree self and things like that, I’ll start to think maybe that kind of thing is internet made. Neopronouns can be tough, but they are legitimate. Used for hundreds of years. These new ones just feel like people are making a mockery of the LGBT+ community and it’s efforts to be recognized.
i think neos like fae xe etc are cool because theyre simple and effective just like the normative ones. fairly easy to adapt to even though i havent used them before but i just feel like it

the new neopronouns like emojipronouns nounself pronouns for specific xenogenders are too much for me. i dont want to refer to anyone by idk dragon slash dragonself pronouns or something. it is indeed internet made because in my opinion i will never adapt them to proper grammar irl so id stick to normative still

im not saying that having these more complex neopronouns shouldnt be allowed but its just not easily suitable for most people. its easier on the internet because you can always check your grammar again and double think before you post your comment but irl you just have to say it instantly
I think they are a bit egocentric, it is exhausting to learn so many new pronouns and how to use them in a sentence.

I get the need for one or a couple of sets of pronouns in languages without an existing neutral pronoun but I saw someone with puppyself or fairy as a pronoun and I was like 'did this person forget what a nickname is?'.
People who use that thing called Tik Tok (I don't see how it's a coincidence that that has the same name as a Ke$ha song) and people who use Twitter... They're all liars!

Neopronouns, despite the ""neo"" in the name, are not new.
I personally don't understand why one would prefer neopronouns over singular they (given that's already gender neutral and gender encompassing, and it's already baked into the English language), but I'll respect others' preferences 🤷

The only pronoun I have a philosophical/emotional block with is ""it/its"", because it feels dehumanizing... but thankfully nobody's asked me to use those. I probably still would out of respect to the individual's lived experience, but I'd find it uncomfortable.. especially since I'm nb myself, and I very much hope we're seen as human 🤐
i don’t really understand neopronouns that are actually nouns, like cats/catself, or other stuff like that, but i really only see those from tiktok’s of teens faking did. other than that, i’m fine with neos. sucks that more people aren’t accepting. i was at a national competition and they had pronoun stickers and one of the examples was xe/xir and one of my teammates said, “now those are the ones i don’t understand.” little did they know i use e/em/eir pronouns :/
Personally I don’t understand neopronouns. They come off as silly to me, I feel like they’re used for attention. What is the issue with using they/them, or whichever generic pronoun fits your identity? I mean no rudeness by this, it’s just my personal take on things and i’d like to learn more.
Turning 32 soon. I personally dont like neo-pronouns, but I think its more because most of my early experience was with Furry's and their adoption of the more...weird ones.   


But heres the thing...Genderless pronouns, like Estonian Ta and Tame, dont bug me despite the 'foreign' nature.  


All this said, if we met IRL I would genuinely try or at least default to they them as best I can. Everyone deserves being comfortable, and I can only promise to try.
Neopronouns are made up, but so is gender.

This is how social constructs work. Building new constructs means it's time for new words.

Anyone who's against neopronouns is just continuing to force people into boxes, and force the existing construct onto people who don't fit into it. This is just more gender based oppression.

They're your pronouns and fuck anyone who says that you can't do with them what you want.
I use neos, a lot of our system does, and we’re a 21 year old adult. 
Neos have been around for a very long time, some of the first being it/its and ze/hir.
i personally think if it makes you happy and comfortable, that's all that matters. i'm still learning about neopronouns and i don't have ppl in my life who use them, so i'm still catching up. regardless, i totally support it if it's who you are and what makes you content. don't let anyone tell you that your genuine identity/pronouns aren't legitimate. if they are legitimate to you, then they just are. <3
I Don’t use them myself, but they’re valid in my book
My thought is if they feel descriptive and right now then go ahead and use them. Doesn't matter if at some point you want to change for whatever reason, they're still helpful to you now and that's enough.

Also it's okay to change if that does happen. Change is part of living and to be expected and you have a lot of living ahead of you at 17. You may stick with these pronouns forever and that's also fine, of course.

Point is they're words meant to communicate so if they communicate what you want them to then keep on keeping on.
I started out not liking neopronouns. But that was based on per/pers, mainly because it was touted by someone I don't quite politically agree with and the fact that when I use it in a sentence it feels like I'm attacking someone. Once I found xie/xem and e/em, my opinion changed.

Some I agree with, like catself and things like that. They do seem a bit childish. I'll respect them none-the-less.
Conceptually, I like the idea, but I've always found the obsession with using 'x' to be stupid. The only sense behind it is that the 'other' marker on M/F entries is an X, but on that same premise, the female pronouns should be Fe/Fer and male would be Me/Mim.

But this as a whole then just feeds into the fact that I really hate how inconsistent and messed up English is as a language. It might be my native language, but it's getting no favourable bias from me. Sadly there's no useful academic authority on repairing and standardising the language or it's spelling so I also can't fault the inconsistency of the solutions for incorporating inclusive terminology.

I'll use whatever pronouns someone prefers as social decency comes before personal pet hates and it's up to the individual decide how to identify, not up to me, but personally I've never touched neopronouns because I've never liked the sound of them and never found one that works relative to existing gendered pronouns that also is easy to say and/or doesn't just take the sloppy approach of either stripping consonants or shoehorning an X (or Z) into it for reasons that just seem lame to me. As such, until English gets some serious formalised overhauls as a whole (which it probably never will despite being a train wreck of a language), it's they/them for me till further notice :/
HAHAHAHAAHAHAHA OMG THAT IS GLORIOUS.  


  
also thats lovely!! I am loving meeting new people on here that use them its so relieving
That's one glorious joke!
oooh that is a good point! thankyou for your take

:)
thankyou :) and i totally agree
oooh i see, thats really interesting thankyou for your insight ! :)
same for german... I envy enbies who live in english-speaking countries haha
I Can't Say For Greek, But Italian Atleast Is Pro-Drop So You Can Usually Just Not Use The Pronouns, But Yeah A Proper Third-Person Singular Neutral Pronoun Would Be Quite Nice.
This very interesting, and a good point. Some languages need neopronouns as gender neutral pronouns may not already exist.
Hey i'm italian and i use ləi! It's actually the most used version of they/them and it's basically a neopronoun kinda like french! There are also other versions like lxi or l*i but i think ləi is much more efficient because we're basically using ""ə"" as a whole new vowel substituting feminine or masculine vowels.

If you know a bit of italian you might've noticed that the ""ə"" in ""ləi"" is placed instead of the ""e"" in ""lei"" (she) and ""u"" in ""lui"" (he). This also applies to gendered adjectives/nouns/3rd person of verbs (example: ""bella"" [fem ver. of beautiful] or ""bello"" [masc ver. of beautiful] becomes ""bellə"" [gender neutral version used by substituing ""a""/""o"" with ""ə""])

I've actually hardly ever seen anyone directly translating they with loro because it would make things a bit confusing grammaticaly since it doesn't *really* have the same role of they/them in english, but it's also important to note that there's not a specific rule for gender neutral pronouns in italian and we're still figuring things out! Hope it helped, i tried explaining it the best i could hope it's not too confusing :')
tysm
:0
thats all good :)
yeah i see this pov as well! unfortunately yeah, its not standard to everyone, and it might take ages to normalise. But also about you using neos, if you feel comfortable with neopronouns, there's no shame in that. If you're too afraid to come out irl, you will always be safe to practice in smaller (or larger?) communities on here or other social sites until you're confident enough to share it. I understand that entirely though, I'm not out to my parents, but when I came out to my friends with just they/them pronouns I didn't get a bright response, in fact when I told them I was genderfluid they nicknamed me 'liquid' (haha so funny...) and continued to only use my assigned at birth pronouns. All in all, pronouns may seem to many like a 'new' thing, as well as neopronouns, but the crux of it is essentially just that people are more comfortable with spreading it now than they used to be. :)

hahaha honestly. I dont know what more sad, the fact they make the jokes, or the fact that if you say ""helicopter joke"" everyone in the nb community collectively knows what they mean /lh lmao!
Yesss
Haha of course! Not taken lmaoo
thankyou :) you too!
AND even if they're used primarily by children, that doesn't make em less legitimate. Queer children nowadays are so damn cool, I envy their confidence! x)
Hahaha I've had so many transphobic ppl say they don't have pronouns it's kinda hilarious. Also thankyou! I think they're super cool too! And your oc must be pretty cool
Wow this is awesome research. Thankyou it clears so much up! Amazing work
Yah things like that, and also they did mention xe/xim/xer (starting with the letter X) pronouns. The tiktok was one of those topic things titled ""what's a true statement that will start a huge argument"" and the users mentioned said ""neopronouns are for young children only and were internet made"" 


Honestly disappointing on their part
Heck yeah!?
This was me when I was still deciding on neos, I use them now but I was scared to before
Yesss
Slay !!
Fr, it's even hard for non-queer spaces to establish they/them and it's so irritating hearing what they have to say.
heck yeah
:) yes i agree
:) thankyou so much this is really reassuring
This is awesome thankyou
I totally agree. Nounself pronouns I feel I could consider a nickname more than a pronoun, but that's just my opinion. :)
I find this very hateful towards people who identify as neopronouns.
> If everyone in the world decided they wanted a set of neopronouns for themselves

Eh... that's simply not going to happen. If there hadn't been people pushing back like ""but it's not gRaMmEr!"", there might even be just one 3rd-person singular gender neutral animate pronoun.

As far as remembering anything, I only remember last names because I have them stored in my phone or my email. If we actually accepted that pronouns are a thing that you can't guess (and you can't always, even excluding neos), then there would be a field to put people's pronouns in, and you'd see it a lot for the people you interact with and end up accidentally remembering.

But, I have a history of overcoming the ""it's hard"" line of thinking... I used to think singular they/them would never happen. And then I learned it, and it did happen (unrelated, obvs). So having overcome the hurdle basically as soon as I actually tried, I have little sympathy for the idea that language is somehow not flexible enough.
thats fair enough and i understand what you mean. I suppose for some it would be a different case of memory but yeah it can totally be a flawed system! thankyou for your insight!
I agree with this. I don’t have a problem with the concept of neopronouns, but it is tricky that there are SO MANY of them. I wish we just had one set of truly gender neutral singular pronouns that were in common use. If I were interacting with someone with neos, I would of course do my best to use their pronouns. But when there are so many to learn none of them become automatic to me and I tend to default to either they/them or just using the person’s name instead of pronouns. 

I definitely don’t look down on neopronouns - at least most of them. Some seem to be intentionally silly and not about gender at all, and those frustrate be a bit because they feel tokenizing. But if someone asks me in good faith to use a pronoun I’m going to try my best.
Preach
yes i agree. Sometimes with these ones like kitten/kittenself, they really confuse me, and sometimes I think maybe I'm missing something, maybe I'm uneducated, yk. i don't want to invalidate people but at the same time things like tree/treeself arent even really pronouns in themself, they're more like nicknames, using actual nouns !
this is exactly my take on them.

i don’t understand the need for nounself terms tbh. they’re confusing and i have already horrible memory, so i wouldn’t be able to remember them and then the person would probably be pissed that i didn’t use the right pronoun. i prefer to just stick with ones that sound like she/her, he/him and they/them
Yeah, the 'neo' part is only really to signify that they're new*er* than ones that already existed in English - xe/xem specifically have been around since the 1970s if I remember correctly so they're definitely not an internet thing.
i understand the it/its thing, i used to feel that way too but I made friends with someone who identified as it/its and they said it was the only pair of pronouns that made them feel like an individual, so its different with everyone :)
:( that's upsetting, but perhaps your friend can be educated ! 

Also yes I totally agree, I want to be as supportive as I can but I am often left baffled by the 'neos' that are nouns like meow/meowself or cat/catself, maybe there's something I'm missing and someone can educate me.  :)
this>>
Just a suggestion if you’d like. You should google “map of gender identities around the world”. You’ll see many resources with maps and dot points you can interact with showing you all across the world, trans/gender non-conforming  people exist everywhere, and we always have and always will. Besides, all language is “made up”.
Don't listen to exclusionist people. Listen to yourself. I eventually figured out that anything but he/him felt at least half right to me so I still answer to the neopronouns sometimes but most people haven't known me long enough to remember that part of my life
Grazie tante per spiegare :)))
You’re welcome!
Xe is really great!
It is hilarious x)
And thanks!! I like to think so!
Thanks 💚, but also... it was literally just a couple google searches like ""invension of ze zem pronouns"" and clicking a few links <.<

Ah~ if the work was useful then ig it's good anyway; I suppose I should just learn to take a compliment someday :P
Oh oof, nvm then
i mean my father already abuses me because he’s too stubborn to accept they/them, so i’d rather not push it further
I mean, I’m still the stage of trying not to refer to customers I work with as “sir” or “ma’am” and avoiding gendering them (I work as a cashier in southern US). Sometimes I even mess up my own pronouns, or other nonbinary folks’ pronouns. Language is hard, even for people who are more used to said language.
I mean, if it was tied to someone’s name, that might lend itself more to being remembered. I.e., “my name is Bob, my pronouns are Bob/Bob’s/Bobself”
This. Completely agree with this take.
Ooooo thankyou I'll check it out
Di nulla! c:
Heheheh it's all good I struggle accepting compliments too :)
Ah yeah that sucks I hope you're okay <3
Oh, language habits are definitely hard to break!, but I try not to let linguistic doomerism seep in cuz that just makes it harder. I do all of those too sometimes (except sir/ma'am)

Actually, I also live in the southern US, and there are people I interact with regularly who always use those titles. I never like either to be honest, so I've been trying out ""friend"" as an alternative (though not for people I'm gonna see once). It's worked so far, and I'm super happy about it! Though I have had to point out once that romance languages use mon amie/amigo/whatever just like that all the time. It might depend who you are if you can get away with doing that unprompted though <.<
No problem at all! I’ve had times where I’ve doubted myself before, letting trans-medicalists opinions affect me. Learning about trans identities around the world and through history really helped me understand that I’m not crazy, and I’m not alone in feeling the way I do. Neither are you, never forget no matter how doubted you are, NBs will have your back friend <3

Also trust me, the older you get the more confident and comfortable you’ll be in who you are. I wish you the best :)
you’d be surprised. it gets normal after a while
I mean, I would feel weird referring to random customers as “friend” as opposed to “ma’am/sir”. I think friend has an informal/casual vibe, like you’re talking to, well, a friend. Meanwhile ma’am/sir has a formal/respectful vibe, like you’re talking to a superior or a client. I hate ma’am/sir for the sole reason of the gendered-ness about it, if there was a gender neutral alternative I would be using that instead.
Thankyou so much :)

A big problem I've always had in telling ppl that I go by neos is how many (really surprising) trans ppl I know irl who have invalidated me because it's not the binary norm. It's so suckish. But we live in a society 😆
I figured it might not work out, but it was worth a shot. I'm still on the lookout for a less-informal way, but short of sheer comedy I've got bupkiss T.T"	vwjwgo	NonBinary	162	0.98	2022-07-11 14:35:25

It’s amusing noticing people staring at you trying to figure out if you’re a “girl” or “boy”. Their brains not able to understand the concept of androgyny or the lack of a gender identity. Their faces looking like:		"Then just when they think they’ve got it figured out, you open your mouth and your voice sends them right back to the drawing board again.  
Just wanna point out that non binary doesn't have to mean ""androgynous"" for all people! Gender identity and presentation are different things! 
I wish I got that look from people :/ no matter how masculine I try to be, I still get automatically classed as a girl
My favorite thing along these lines is when little kids are fascinated with you💜 its the cutest thing ever
If only this happened :/

still trying!
All. The. Time. 
Their tiny little brains can’t comprehend anything out of the binary. 
I love this so much.
This is all I want in my life, transition-wise
Person: (so they have short hair.... and baggy clothes, mostly masculine looking... and they don't seem to have a chest either, I got it!)

So i'm nonbinary after all	"I identified as genderfluid for some years because sometimes I felt really silly and weird being femme and using she/her pronouns, and other times it was euphoric. 

Shortly after beginning mtf hrt, I became much more comfortable with myself and finally allowed myself to be feminine freely. It was a really rough road but I walked it. I felt like I was really comfortable identifying as a transwoman and explored my identity to a good extent.

I met other trans people down the line: both binary and nb. And in time I realized I am not like the other transwomen I met. After 3 years of hormones, I'm comfortable with the way I look. I'm feminine looking but visibly trans/androgynous, and I really like that. I never use my femme voice bc I like my 40hz base pitch voice and I'm proud of my transition. I no longer mind he/him pronouns. Or any pronouns tbh. I prefer she/her or they/them, but any is fine. I prefer to be seen simply as a feminine person, not a man or a woman. I am transfeminine and gender non conforming and thats perfect.

I guess this is sort of my second coming out, for anyone out there experiencing something similar and doubting themselves.  Only you know you. Don't be afraid to explore and accept yourself, even if you think you've made a decision. This whole deal is a long journey full of twists and turns. You are valid, and your identity is valid.  

Thank you for reading

Edit: if anyone has any questions or would like to discuss my/their experience, feel free to ask. Dm doesnt work on this app (or at least I never found how to use it) but you can comment or inbox"	"Hello, I'm AMAB and enby too, and I have a (potentially triggering) question for you. So don't answer if you don't want to.

So here's the thing. I'm confident in my identity, but not in my appearence. I'm considering taking HRT some day maybe, tbut I don't want to be full-time femme. So I'm wondering, after years of HRT, could you still look masc if you wanted to? And at what age did you start HRT? Because those are big things to take into consideration if I take this decision.
Sounds alot like what I'm doing. The main thing that told me I was NB was that if I go too fem I get dysphoria just like too masc.
>feminine looking but visibly trans/androgynous

God, that's goals. 

Back when I thought I was a binary trans woman I was always jealous of any femme looking mid way pictures on transtimelines, hopefully that's where I end up.

Congrats on exploring and figuring yourself out more, proud of you!
I think I've had a similar experience so far, can rel8. Your goals sound similar to mine, too!
Welcome to the fam, fam!
Gender Outlaw is a pretty cool book to read :) it's informative and sometimes inspiring and sometimes it gets things wrong imo but it's all around good
I've gone through something similar, except going the FtM route.  I pass as a man and that's great, but it also doesn't feel completely like me. I would never detransition and I hate being referred to as girl or presenting as such, but I can't deny a more feminine side to my internal gender feelings. 

I was wondering if you struggled a bit to the conclusion of being NB after transitioning?  I'm having trouble accepting it I think due to, what I acknowledge, is probably internalized transphobia.
Thanks so much for sharing your experience! I'm binary, but hearing stories like yours is part of what helped me figure out I was binary and not nb. I was unsure for a while if I was a dude or just transmasc, until it occurred to me that while being transmasc got rid of most of my dysphoria, only being 100% dude gave me gender euphoria.
Sorry this is so incoherent, there's just a lot of thoughts I have here.

I kind of feel this as an AFAB; I wondered if I was a transman for a while, but it was largely from internalized binarism and wanting to feel valid. I definitely want to look more masculine, but more of a ""pretty boy"" type masculine. 

While I would have preferred to have been assigned male, I do like my curves, though I also would like top surgery.

I still want to be femme once in a while, but then there's that whole ""does this invalidate my identity/make me a cis woman after all"" feeling that I don't like. I'm not really genderfluid (at least not to any further extent than the average cis person, just that my range is different) and yet I still want to go back and forth if that makes sense? And to feel like my femininity doesn't detract from my masculinity. 

I also love when people use ""he"" for me. I've been off of T for a few months now because of losing my insurance and I hate it, my face is going back to how it was and it feels wrong, not to mention that I felt great on T and now my body feels like it's on the wrong fuel. (I'm gonna have to call the clinic because I think they have a sliding scale.) Even despite that, the other day someone asked my friend if I was her son, which was really funny but also made me happy that I was gendered as male even with my long hair and with my face getting goofy again. 

I guess the TL;DR version is that I have both masculinity and femininity in me, and I want and need to express both, but there's a certain amount of shame with expressing or liking femininity because I feel like I'm not valid/trans enough, or even feeling like I'm appropriating AMAB culture.

Hello! No worries, perfectly valid question.

I started hrt at 27. it's been 3 years and 2 months. I could definitely still look masc with the right clothes and hair. I end up looking like what you might call a 'pretty boy', which at least to me is not a bad deal at all.

But I can also do up my hair, put on a little make up and wear clothes that complement my contours and i pass as female to a lot of ppl until i speak
Me too!! I really thought I was just a butch lesbian but I am so uncomfortable in an entirely stereotypical female gender role. I always thought it was bring euphoria but it doesnt? I'm most comfortable being just me.

Congrats on being you too!! We need a louder voice to help guide those others lost
Thank you!! And I'm really happy you found yourself too (: it's kind of an odd place to even begin looking for an identity but we made it lol I hope I can help others do so too
Yay! Ty (:
> but there's a certain amount of shame with expressing or liking  femininity because I feel like I'm not valid/trans enough, or even  feeling like I'm appropriating AMAB culture. 

I get this same type of issue in reverse. I'm AMAB and consider myself androgynous and pretty fem-leaning, but I still identify with a lot of aspects of queer male culture so I usually go by he/they pronouns. Sometimes that makes me feel like I'm undermining my chances of not being seen as ""just"" a ""man"", or like I'm gonna wrongly make people think I'm transmasc.
Thanks a lot for the answer :)
I wonder if this is an issue a lot of enbies face; if constant invalidation causes a lot of us to fear that connecting with anything related to our AGAB feels like a betrayal to our identities, or otherwise fear that others won't accept us if we're open about it. Even if the entire reason we're nonbinary is that we don't fit into the binary and we don't necessarily go completely in the other direction, it still feels like there is a need for separation and distance from our AGAB in order to be accepted.

Growing up clothes were nice and fun. But now, after settling into my enby identity and rejecting social norms for peeps with a penis… I love picking out a cute outfit to match my mood. 😻💕❄️		"Me too!!!
Same. Also I like the shade of pink.
So how do you feel in this one?
So cute 🥰
So so cute!!!! Love the outfit! ☺️😊
I LOVE THE COLORS!!!! And I love activewear as fashion 🥰🥰🥰
Very inspiring I love it 🥰
Woot woot! 🙌🏻
I know I love this shade! I just got the top recently and love rocking matching leggings and sports bra with a jacket or wrap over top.
Omg I love this! This is right up my ally. I wear mostly athletic clothes cause…well, it’s just my general fav. I do wear other stuff too but this is my general style except I also wear lots of tanks.
Why thank you, my friend!! :)
Hehe thank youuuuu! ☺️🙃
Thank you! I love how the white makes the pink pop all the more. I really love this shade of pink. Comfy and cute. :)

Envious of the cool androgynous looking people on here	"I pass as cis. I am fine with it, because it's the most comfortable for me. It's not ideal, but it's the best arrangement. However, it seems that nonbinary is actually treated as a third binary by most people in the queer community as well. So basically I ended up feeling like I don't belong anywhere both when it comes to cishets who will never respect who I am, and when it's in the queer community, where I get imposter syndrome.

I don't have anyone to tell me stuff like ""you're valid"", ""do what makes you the most comfortable and know that I will respect and understand who you are regardless""

And I think I'm coming close to my breaking point because I've been living like this for years and it hurts.

I don't want to change how I look just to please people who feel like nonbinary should be its own binary. I don't think I look good trying to look androgynous, i have tried when I was younger and it made me feel unattractive (not that androgynous people are unactractive, it's the opposite for me, but because of how I'm naturally built and my face, and my BDD i have a very complicated relationship with my body so I NEED to look good for myself and myself mostly)

So yeah, stuck in between. Rejected by society.

Cishet guys never wanting to be just friends and never acknowledging my pronouns. Sick of the disappointments. Cishet girls eventually noticing I'm acting ""odd"" because I'm not really one of them, also misgendering all the time. All this despite coming out to these people. But they have no idea or care for what I'm talking about when I come out to them.
Growing up all of my friends turned out to be lesbians. Only one of them ever respected my gender identity. So it's a queer people problem too. At least those around me.

""You don't need to fit in"" yeah, I do. Because the loneliness becomes unbarable and the depressive episodes are becoming darker. And I'm alone because I don't fit in anywhere and can't trust anybody to be my friend.

My gender identity is more complicated than just they/them pronouns, but it's more convinient to only ask people to respect that instead of explaining myself to them all the time, which is also a huge risk. And yet, yet these assholes can't even respect one simple thing such as pronouns and using neutral terminology with me. Fuck everyone.
I used to love people, now I'm sick of everyone.

Can't have friends, can't have a pleasing social life. Let alone partners. Or sexual encounters. Because I can't trust anybody.
Everything is just so sad and frustrating.
And when I go into details with therapists all they can do is say ""yeah, that's understandable"". So yeah. No solution. I'm stuck being ""the weird one that could easily have a normal life but chooses to seek attention by wanting to be different so badly"" (my parents and possibly most people I came out to)

EDIT: Thank you everyone for sharing with me your experiences and for taking the time to write such kind words. I feel easily overwhelmed by this issue lately and I definitely felt overwhelmed also by the kindness of you all and the simple interaction with other nonbinary people, who finally understand me. I will go through all your comments as soon as I feel like I can handle it. Thank you again, despite the anonymity provided by Reddit, I still felt the warmth of your words and I don't feel so alone anymore."	"nonbinary doesn't look like anything, you ARE valid, people just lack empathy and the ability to try and understand. YOU are a gorgeous nonbinary person and YOU are so so so valid.
As an amab masc presenting enby I feel this so hard
If you can handle some dark periods of time then everything will work out, when I came out as nb but started to social transition as a man (being very masculine and accepting he/him pronouns from strangers) yeah I lost like all my friends and certain people around me distanced themselves from me, but I found my people (they kinda found me) yeah most of them are younger kids that look up to me but I still love being a parental figure in their lives. I had only one friend that stayed with me through it all, you can have people you hang out with but they aren't your friends if they don't accept how things are. The real ones will stay, the the real ones will come. With confidence people will see it and let you truly be you. I have basically replaced everyone around me. And with my confidence and feel good attitude because I'm living my life and not worried about people, I have friends, I have acquaintances, I have school buddies, people look at me and think I got my shit together. It works out in the end, it just takes time, you will have a period of time when you have no friends, you have no one to turn to. You become a hermit. But in that time you become the most YOU. You find hobbies, you find your true personality, you find what makes you happy. Find you before finding other people.
I’m neither him nor her. A French composer once said, “music is the space between the notes.”
I feel the same
You don't need to look a certain way to be NB!!!!
I also find myself jealous towards more androgynous people sometimes. 
But I'm AMAB and present very masc. The only times people were confused about my gender was on the phone and because of my name which is gender neutral but socially leaning femme. 
What I'm trying to say is, you can look like you pass without a question of a doubt and still not fit in the gender binary, and like others said. You are valid and accepted here!!!
Sending all the love your way and I know you can endure the hard times, you have so far💛🤍💜🖤
I’m so sorry you feel this way. It is so painful socially, sexually, emotionally, intimately to present a way that is not expected as “THE LOOK” for enby folk, and be excluded, even shamed for it. Please know that, like you, we are out here, a whole spectrum of gender fluidity inside and out—many of us don’t fit “THE LOOK” for the same reasons you don’t. Gender, and it’s expression, is more than appearance. Recently, many have often felt like the non-binary identity is being pigeon holed as a third gender with its own celebrities leading the charge and building media hype and social expectations of what we should all look like—defying the vast and varied spectrum of what we ACTUALLY look like, and ignoring that gender is far, far more than just looks. It’s very shallow to assume otherwise. Please keep the faith.  It won’t be easy, but you will find those that will get you for who YOU are.
I wrestle with this daily and then throw my hands up at the patriarchy for putting me in this damn box where I'm only 'safe' when I'm still performing for them, whether that be sticking to my gender assigned at birth, or going full on in the opposite binary's displays of gender, or being androgynous enough to signal to people I'm non-binary based on looks alone.

Fuck their furrowed brows at how we show up, that's the conditioning leaving their bodies. It's okay to care what they think, that's how we stay safe in our society. I think what's more affirming for me is working on winning myself over for my choices and caring what I think about myself more.
honestly, were on a similar boat, for one part I really don't present as NB, but I also don't really feel very identified with the nb community since sometimes I like some aspects of both genders and I like to present as both, but if I say someting like that I automatically get boxed in ""gender fluid"" even if that doesn't really feel correct. 

labels are inventions of society since we need to identify with something as to feel we're not alone nor too much different. some people really take it to heart since they formed such a strong connection with the label as their identity that's they can't just think of another way. 

so, in reality you really shouldn't worry so much about not fitting in the mold. if that's the case maybe something else is the problem, like, we know that it's important for us that people recognize our identity. but my question is, why is it for you? is it just the validation or maybe something else? 

as por people and your identity, maybe you should try to run in different circles. since we have a tendency to rotate to people in witch we recognize certain patterns, and the people you decided to mix with, simply weren't so considerate, after all, everyone is different and you can't say you have meet all of the planet population
Have you tried seeking out a group of friends that is also nonbinary/queer? Cishet people are not going to understand you in the same way that other nonbinary people will.
You’re valid :)
I am also an enby passing as cis, but I look very good androgynous but I don’t dare to dress that way in public.
Non binary does not necessarily equal androgynous. Androgyny is in between. We are other than. That’s how I think of myself.
as others have said u don’t need to look a certain way, the way how i see it bc i have days where i prefer to look more “feminine” presenting or “masculine” presenting, i jus’ want ppl to see me as me, and if they don’t see me for how i’m comfortable expressing on any given day i usually don’t spend too much time w them. anyway u choose to look is valid and i promise u u’ll find a community that makes u feel safe, i’m always here if u wanna talk ♡
You are not alone. I have the same struggle with body image and the androgynous look just doesn't always suit me. It sucks cause I have to push a lot to get the correct pronouns used for myself and that makes people uncomfortable (but that's very much a them problem, as my therapist reminds me frequently).

Many hugs for you. We don't owe anyone androgyny. You're still valid no matter how you present ❤
Hey. Wear the clothes that make you feel good. Do it. I do. You don’t owe anyone an outfit, except yourself. You’re nonbinary? Neat. Anything you wear that makes you feel good is a valid nonbinary outfit. Because it is your outfit. 

Don’t change anything about yourself to please people who are not interested in who you are. You don’t owe anyone any way of being other than the one that’s truest to you. 

I really get what you’re saying about fitting in, and I think that what you are actually looking for is your community, the people who fit in with you as much as you fit in with them, rather than to actually fit in with people who have mental walls up that don’t allow them to see the awesomeness of *you*. I also get that ‘find your community’ isn’t on its face helpful advice, because ok, that’s nice, now tell me how and who. I’m saying it here more because I hope that it may help change your focus, because I think that being unable to be yourself surrounded by people who don’t get you is just as lonely as being alone, and I want you to know that you 100% deserve to be able to be you and seen and liked and loved. Unaccepting people don’t mean there’s something wrong with you, it is entirely a reflection of them.
So, I'm probably not the best for talking about this (I'm a 14 year old demiboy who doesn't have his shit together by any means and still isn't able to help himself), but here's what I think. 

Yeah, I'm part of the enby spectrum, as I don't completely identify with my AMAB, but I'm still masc-presenting and that makes me comfortable. I haven't tried looking androgynous though, but I'm pretty sure that, even if I don't completely feel like a man, I like how I look in the sense as of what gender I look like (I think I'm ugly and I'd want to change that, but that doesn't have anything to do with the gender thingy). You can be an enby and not be androgynous. Non-binary IS NOT a third binary, it is an umbrella term for ANYTHING that doesn't fit into the gender binary of men and women, and if there's anyone who says it's not like that, just say ""who asked?"" And move on. There's a lot of people who can relate, so just know that the people that will accompany you for all your live are there somewhere, and they're looking for you as much as you're doing with them. 


So, as a summary of what I just said: YOU. ARE. FRICKING. VALID. There's a lot of people like you out there, and they will be the ones to help you truly be yourself. You do have to accept what we're saying in this comment section; after all, I recognize that I have the problem with not applying the advice that I'm given and denying that it is even true, so I do not want to be like that, it is hurtful, and I don't want my enby pals to be hurt.
I understand what you mean...before I even knew I was nonbinary this was my understanding of it, a gender outside of male and female...only when I came to truly understand nonbinary as a spectrum did I understand that I myself was nonbinary too. For some enby people, it IS a third gender to them, and for some it is not, it exists outside the binary. So please know you're not alone in feeling this way. 💖 I often hear the same struggle in my head and gaslight myself into thinking I'm still cis and making this shit up. No, I am nonbinary and always will be. As are you 💛🤍💜🖤
I can relate. ""Passing"" as cis, and feeling like an imposter bc I can ""hide"" behind the appearance I'm mostly fine with, and my hetero appearing marriage. All I can think of is to try and find a friend group, even if that has to be online. No matter what you look like or your presentation, it's about how you feel about yourself that matters. I wish I had something better for you, just know that many other NB's feel like you do, at least we're suffering together.
i feel you and am in a similar boat from what i gather. almost all people assume i'm cis from what i look like, even if i tell them my pronoun, people don't use it, apart from the few close friends i have. even my therapist lowkey does not understand anything about gender, even after multiple explanations. the will is not there.

so this is probably a bad idea, but since cis people overwhelmingly are a lost cause, i decided to completely reject any opinion on the topic from them outright. they never had any authority or knowledge of me, my inner workings, so any attribution they try to pin on me is false from the get go. at least it's mentally freeing, but it does not magically make patriarchal gender norms vanish
Not sure if this will really help, but non-binary is an umbrella term. Under that falls agender (genderless), and androgyne (a state of gender between the two binaries), polygender (melting pot of gender expression). It seems like you’ve had trouble with people conflating these identities with non-binary. You don’t need to be in a state of androgyny/genderlessness to be non-binary. Non-binary is existing outside of the gender binary. There’s a ton of other identities in the non-binary umbrella (demi-girl/boy/non-binary, gender-fluid) which have people identifying with a certain gender expression. They are just as valid. But yeah, it’s silly Bc non-binary is to exist out of the binary so to create a box of rules that you need to satisfy just negates the point of being non-binary. No single non-binary person identifies the same, and that’s what is so cool. It’s unique to you. It doesn’t and shouldn’t look the same for everyone. You don’t need to identify with a certain micro label to be valid, just express yourself and your identity and be comfortable. That’s all you can do. <3
It sounds like you've had an unlucky draw as far as the people around you. Or maybe I've just been lucky. I'm a fem-presenting AFAB masc-aligned enby. Only once have I had an issue with someone I've come out to not respecting my identity. I live in an extremely conservative area and I cannot be out openly for my own safety. 

Most of my inner circle is trans and/or non-binary. That could be a factor. Are you able to find better social circles? I mean, even if you were a woman, having cishet guys who can't just be friends is an example of bad people around you, so clearly at least on that front this goes deeper than the transphobia issue?
I am a masc-presenting amab enby and doomed to be misgendered by everyone until the end of my days.
Another one of us here as well. You are valid, OP. You are valid, tisjustbrandon.
That is a lovely way of putting it. Going along the music analogy line, I’ve also heard that, to properly appreciate jazz music, you’re supposed to listen to where the notes AREN’T being played. Or something like that.

In other words: defy convention. Embrace individuality.
Anyhoo, hi, I’m nothanks, I’m thirty…six?, Canadian, a fab two gender, adhd, anxiety, two small children, actor and student on hiatus from both, i like playing with words and would like to someday do it for money. Books are my friends. Nice to meet you. Feel free to dm me if you ever need to vent or just wanna chat with a random internet friend.
I discovered how to maneuver between the notes when I first stepped onto an EDM dance floor. A queer friendly place where you fall in love, dance, befriend, sweat, and shed away the pain. I also discovered radical empathy.
It is amazing what music can do. And what affirming, friendly spaces can do too.
It’s been nearly eight years since I put everything in my rearview. I never fully assessed the damage that place had done to my self-esteem, my mental state and all the whatevers too. 

THAT place embraced authoritarian conformity. THOSE people took it upon themselves to mow down the first blade of grass that grew taller than the rest. 

I used to dance in my room listening to my dad’s vinyl album of Pearl Jam VS. 

I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings... made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks, or apologize
I couldn't breathe, holdin' me down
Hand on my face, pushed to the ground
Enmity gauged, united by fear
Forced to endure what I could not forgive...

I seem to look away
Wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface... most defiled
Head at your feet, fool to your crown
Fist on my plate, swallowed it down
Enmity gauged, united by fear
Tried to endure what I could not forgive

Saw things
Saw things
Saw things
Saw things
Clearer
Clearer
Once you, were in my...
Rearviewmirror...

I gather speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all I'm far away
I hardly believe, finally the shades...are raised...

Saw things so much clearer

First time out fem with my own hair. Still not really sure what I’m doing after 16 years of flipping between fem/masc identities. I’m trying to find some middle ground		"[removed]
Looks like a good middle ground to me. Your hair's nice and neat, too.
I first went out to a trans club in 2003, had a makeover for it. Then went out maybe a handful of times a year. That steadily increased to the point that almost any social event I’d be more likely to wear a dress. But my fem self and masc self have always been totally different. I’ve always aimed to pass as fem. I’ve ended up with this weird split identity, I even have two Facebook profiles. 

I can’t really stand it any more! But I’m still too scared of what people think :(
Thanks x

How have you found it taking HRT while identifying non-binary?

I'm scared that I'd be making serious permanent physical changes to myself for maybe the wrong reasons. Still feel like I'm not ""trans"" enough for it.
[removed]
How do you control the HRT if you don't want to be ""completly"" woman as HRT is supposed to do?
> I'm not transitioning to be a women; I'm transitioning to a place that better suits me

That's what I need to get my head around and accept. I just want to get to a version of myself that better reflects how I feel and how I want the world to perceive me. The idea of growing into an ""old man"" is terrifying, especially losing my hair. Thinking about it makes me seriously depressed.

I envy people who fit into the binary thing, they can have a clear goal for what they want. I'm more ""I'll know it when I get there"" which is hard for the people close to me. It's constant uncertainty, doubt and second guessing.
[removed]
My SO is trans and we've been together throughout her entire transition, so I've seen all the effects first hand. I know it can vary a lot between different people though. I think I'd generally be pretty happy with it.

My next step is to go back to my therapist but I'm pretty sure HRT is where I'm heading. I don't think I'll bother with the NHS, I've already identified the private providers I can go to and what it costs. It's not that expensive.

You only live one life, I'm getting very close to 40 and have been agonising over this stuff for far too long.
[removed]
I'm in the UK, NHS is National Health Service.

I've just turned 37 and also thinking I need to have this done before 40. It's nice to hear of other people doing this at a similar age. I see so many younger non-binary people and can't help feeling like I've missed the boat on it."	cmnret	NonBinary	147	1.0	2019-08-06 08:04:12

hey what is that cut of jeans called cause they look great! (and so do you!)
I dont know what it is about today but I'm definitely feeling more like my true self as well.
Yes! Today has been a Good Day™️ of little to no dysphoria & actually quite a bit of euphoria because I went to the salon & was addressed by my chosen name & set up an appointment to get a haircut (slightly longer on top with a side fade + hard part), style, bleach/tone & color next week! Depending on how well my hair does with the lightening (bc I do have natural medium brown hair & sometimes it's gone well & others it just goes midtone yellow), it'll either be purple at the end OR cotton candy pink & blue with some of the light blonde peaking through (aka the trans flag colors, kinda). And OH I was nervous bc I've never been to that salon & wasn't sure how queer friendly they were (but I have a gift card I gotta use before I move so ayyyy) but she was SO awesome. I'm just riding on the high of the haircut I've chosen to get and how excited I am to have colorful hair again 🥰🥰🥰

Also, you're looking awesome & omg I wrote so much more abt my day than you wrote on your main post 😅😅
Powerful words. Also you look great! ✨🥂
ahhhhh thank you 🥹 i’m glad to hear the radiance is glowing from the inside out ❤️‍🔥
OK apparently they are relaxed fit, tapered high waist jeans haha! I got them from Uniqlo! Thank you 🥺 I appreciate that since these jeans seem to have shrank since I last wore em and I felt kinda insecure abt that haha
OH HECK YEAH!! I am so happy to hear that 💖 the more of us who feel that way, the more interesting and gentle the world becomes. To more days like this!! ✨✨
I always say this but — whenever I get called by my chosen name, a little part of me heals. 💓 I am so excited for you going on this hair journey!! The trans flag colors would look SICK. Definitely good you’ll have someone else doing it for you as doing the ombre thing alone is a fucking nighmare hahaha! Literally got a haircut today too and I am SO tempted to dye it highlighter yellow, idk it just feels so right!! 

And thank you, friend! Feel free to go on lengths abt your day though!! I love hearing tales of much deserved euphoria 💓💓
Every time. 💜 I've been writing my chosen name on date labels at work lately (line cook by day... void by night 😂😅) just to kinda... hint. But I've only got like less than 2 months left here so if only 2 of them (whom I'm closest to & talk to abt... a lot & will likely stay friends with post-this job) use it, I'll be happy. 

I'm SO hoping my hair lightens enough to get the trans flag colors. I never thought I'd ever want pink in my hair (or wardrobe). I've fought it and anything stereotypically 'girly' my entire life (& anything stereotypically gendered either way tbh - there were so many missed signs, lol). But I just love the combo & pink really is one of the best colors on me so f*ck it. I will, of course, be quite happy with purple too though since it's my all-time favorite color. I've gone purple more times than I can count, haha. 

I think, with enough confidence, you could ROCK any color you wanna go for. Just be kind to your hair in the process if you decide to actually go highlighter yellow 🥰"	12aq4p6	NonBinary	147	0.99	2023-04-03 16:47:50
Accused of office affair for being bi and enby	"So yeah. That's it. Yesterday my immediate supervisor and another department 's manager asked to see me and gave me a verbal warning for trading company 's information for sex. Feel free to laugh. That was my initial reaction. Apparently there was a meeting between them and a third manager, and a disgrunted soon to be former employee cited precise details from this meeting that could only be known by those who attended it... or apparently by me, since my office is next door. The theory is that every time someone said something about this guy, I would run to tell him all about it, and in exchange he would fuck me in the ass. Forget that I never been accused before of innapropriate behavior at work. Forget that i'm in a monogamous relationship for the past TWENTY years. I feel that, since I was never ashamed of declaring myself bi and enby, people automatically assume this lies must be true. They could have listened to my denials, to my arguments, hell, to the fucking logic! Instead they repeated the same homophobic escuses like ""we respect you but expect you to behave in a certain way here"" or ""you're free to do whatever you want, but we do not allow in-company relationships"" and yadda yadda. I had even to hear that I should not tell that I'm queer to my students, wich piss me off in so many levels. I'm feeling hummiliated, denied from dignity, as if had my identity erased. I'm pissed, I wanna cry, I want to tell everyone to go to hell, I almost did not come to work today. And I'm deffinilety taking legal actions. But right now, I could do with some love and support."	"Holy f*ck. 

Definitely get a lawyer involved. 

Thats a serious allegation against you and it sounds to me like disgruntled soon to be ex employee is using your open queerness as an excuse to cover for whatever source they actually got the details from, and your asshole management are homophobes and just assume that “it must be true”…

Good luck!

Big hugs your direction, stay strong!
get a lawyer, thats sexual discrimination
Please speak to your local ACLU. If they cannot help you take legal action, they should be able to refer you to good lawyers who can help. The situation sounds quite absurd. Hang in there and good luck.
I would encourage you to contact a lawyer, and stop posting about it online. We're sending you warm wishes, but writing about your experiences may hurt your legal case.
I'm so sorry you're going through this! It's maddening that people who should know you better are so ready to believe the worst about you; what a betrayal. I hope everything resolves in your favor.  <3
Bloody hell. Sending you hugs.

I hope this resolves quickly for you, and in your favour. And you might want to consider looking for another job now you know just how awful management there is.
I’ve never understood why the media completely normalizes heterosexual teachers talking to their students about their romantic/sexual life when no one asked. But if someone who isn’t cishet mentions that to a student when it’s actually relevant, it’s a big deal…
Fuck yes, take legal action. If you need a tall German theydy to fly over and punch them, I'm down. It might take me a few years because I'm broke as a junkie, but holy fucking shit.

First of all, how casual do these idiots think anal is? Having anal sex at the office would be so freaking messy and uncomfortable, like holy shit these dudes are idiots.

And that point comes in AFTER the freaking bi- and transphobia. These fucking nutjobs. Holy shit.

If you need some dog pictures to cheer you up, I got you. I am raging too hard to be very comforting right now, but I think you've got this. Lawyer up and sue their asses so hard that they WISH they had a clue about how to prep for anal.
I'm so sorry. You have every right to be angry. Your organization behavior is unacceptable and bigoted bordering on intimidation. Document and record all you can then lawyer up
I’m so sorry that happened. And to echo everyone else, it’s time to take legal action.
Yeah, take that to HR to get documented, and protections put in place, stat. 1000% start litigation.
Hey just read this post and was hoping everything is going OK and you're doing alright.
I can spend days talking about how being oppenly queer helped me not only connect with many students but also help a lot of them outside the classroom. Mostly of our demographic are in humble, conservative, mainly religious families (we are a business school aimed to teenagers looking for their first job). So many of them got kicked out of home, got beaten up, got bullied, got problems with the law, had the most different troubles talking to friends, relatives, love interests... I cannot imagine doing my job (I'm an I.T. teacher and also head of the teaching department) without being honest and open about who I am.
Unfortunatly the person who gave me the warning is also the head of HR. And yeah, I already contacted a lawyer.
*flips table*
With that kind of gross negligence and sexual harassment I'm assuming they're not a member of SHRM, but they do have a discipline process for their members if that's the case.

A little reminder if you've been feeling weird about your identity lately.	"if you want to wear a suit or wear a skirt, it's up to you, it's your own choice.
You shouldn't feel forced to wear that skirt just to prove to people that you aren't male.
You should wear it if you simply feel like wearing a skirt.

And you shouldn't feel forced to wear a suit just to prove to people that you aren't female.
It doesn't make you any less non binary to dress a certain way.

You should dress that way if you want to. If you think it looks cool. 
Nobody else's opinions matter in this subject. Even if someone comments, it's invalid. they aren't you. It's up to you to decide how you are going to dress. Your identity is your own thing, it's in no way theirs.
Gender isn't black and white."	"But put a coat on. It's chilly out.
Thank you! I needed to hear it right now, because even in non-binary community I sometimes feel myself trapped between masc vs. femme dichotomy. Being genderless / neutral it is hard to deal with that and very dysphoric sometimes.
Thank you kind, queer, stranger 💜🌈

This is actually exactly something I needed to read right now.
I've only recently come out to a friend about being Enby Gender Fluid (I'm AMAB) and she has even offered me to have some of her old dresses if they fit!
I'm still working on the way I want to look with my body and my hair and can't wait until I look how I want to look.
I'm still gathering the confidence to be able to come out to the rest of my friends and family.

I can't wait to get my nails done tomorrow and check out how I can dye my hair without damaging it. It's natural black and short right now and I want to grow it out to shoulder length at least.

Emotions have been all the place the past few days and this put a smile on my face
I want to wear a skirt, but my dog jumps up on people, and so it isn't practical.
Great now I have no idea what to wear
Good idea it snowed where I live.

New here and saying hello. Been on the identity rollercoaster since age 35. Got it right at 44.		"You’re giving this mid thirties eggy a huge smile! It’s always nice to see the 30+ crew holding it down, and being absolutely amazing! It’s inspiring. :) 
30s/40s enbys unite!
I'm AFAB. I came out as trans when I was in my late 30's. Just came out as NB recently. I feel so much better about myself, and feel like a weight was lifted.

I'm struggling with name/pronouns. I just got everyone at work used to calling me by the name I've gone by socially for over 10 years. Which, I changed. Just in my online and non work environment.

I'm really happy to have found this community. It's good to know as I struggle, I'm not alone.
Thanks for repping the 40s crowd. I'm just two months away from being in the company of them!
I’ve struggled. I’ve wanted transition. I’ve felt guilt and confusion for not knowing what I was. I wordily told a friend last year about my experiences and she asked if I was non binary. When I didn’t know what that was she encouraged me to look into it and I’m glad I did.
I tell people say whatever pronouns without disdain and I’ll listen. I use my given name (Travis) for a lot but when I say ash to someone it means I want them to be around. I picked ash for it’s no gender ownership. 
Congratulations! It's never too late (or too early) to come out!

break ups are hard. esp when your evolving identity is an impasse your partner can’t get over. can anyone relate?		"I know the feeling too. I came out to my husband of 5 years and he doesn't understand. He thinks if I don't feel like a woman, I need to just redefine what it means to be a woman so it matches me. He doesn't use my pronouns when we're around people I am out to, so I haven't even told him the new name I would like to go by since he'll refuse to use it anyways. My family would be even worse if I came out to them, so it's frustrating knowing he's not fully in my corner
My ex was nonbinary too. But they became increasingly weird and transphobic when I expressed that I didn't identify as perfectly androgynous and was transmasc. They didn't use the words that I preferred for myself and used words for their own sexuality that felt misgendering. It really sucked and now dating someone who isn't like that has opened my eyes to how unhappy I was. Navigating relationships with an evolving understanding of yourself is very difficult. My optimistic take is that you'll find a new partner who will make you happy and love you just as you are. Not how they wish you were.
my partner was a cis-woman who has always identified as straight. i wish i could flip a switch and she would just continue to love me as i am
My partner is a transman. I once thought thats who i was too. I was well into transitioning before he started. I realized i didnt and never did desire to be full male. But i had dysphoria and did have to take action to help it. Ive always been androgynous so i told him im androgyne/transmasculine but not a man. I prefer neutral pronouns. But hes seen it as an attack on his own identity for many reasons and says he once saw himself in me and now it's not the same and hasnt been very respectful. Im trying to give him time and see if he comes around but it's been REALLY ROUGH
Yes.
It’s something I worry about a lot. My partner is straight and I worry sometimes that I’ll be too trans/gay for him and what that means for our relationship. He’s been nothing but supportive and tells me he doesn’t care though, which helps
Yes, unfortunately.
Definitely, caught one of my exes cheating on me cause I started dressing fem, got over her real quick
All these stories are enlightening, thanks for sharing. 

I myself am in a situation where I'm contemplating getting back together with my ex-boyfriend but my NB identity makes me wary. He's straight and extremely attracted to me, which is actually pretty difficult for me as I feel I am asexual. I miss him a lot though.

We are still very close and really love each other. I finally starting talking with him about being NB and lucky me, he is supportive and doing his best to understand it. He thinks he won't mind if I transition and wants to try dating again. I have reservations though.

I think I want to transition to something more transmasc and he is just so damn straight, I dunno...he is probably assuming I want to be just more androgynous but I think I wanna go further than that. 

It's also difficult because I have already been heartbroken and it's very scary to be vulnerable again. Part of me just wants to close off and never do relationships anymore.

Anyway. I have a lot to think about...in many ways I feel fortunate for having some acceptance but  paranoid it will go away. I think I'll probably make him wait for a few years while I figure myself out. He lives on the other side of the country now anyway. It's hard for me not to consider his opinion but also I really shouldn't...
thanks for the responses. i’m feeling a bit more grounded now knowing that i was rejected not for anything i did but for who i am. it’s a shitty thing to face but i don’t want to be with someone who can’t see me for me
I hope it gets better for you soon
i’m sorry to hear that. this is a tough one for me since everything otherwise was still so great. she just couldn’t see me in her future.
i can totally relate. this is essentially the same situation i was in. my partner was accepting of me while i still presented primarily masc (even after coming out as nb) but once i realized that masculinity isn’t a part of my identity and i am a femme nb, that’s when things changed and she couldn’t see me as the same person. it sucks and it’s hard and the love is undeniable but if the other person isn’t willing to truly love and honor who you are it isn’t right. we shouldn’t have to struggle for acceptance from someone we love! there’s someone out there who will give us that and more. 💕💕💕
Aww. Thanks for replying. It really does suck to have to choose between freeing yourself and appeasing a partner. It's hardly a choice though. You gotta be yourself. If your partner ""loves you"" but doesn't see you as YOU, their love isn't about you at all...

This stuff is rough. I wish you happiness. Keep searching for someone who can appreciate you fully. Keep being brave. 🖤💛💜"	cmq7q7	NonBinary	140	1.0	2019-08-06 12:54:18
"dad says it ""hurts"" him to call me by my correct pronouns"	"(I use ae/aer btw)

How do you even respond to that? How am I supposed to communicate that my feelings are more important than his in matters of MY identity? That my gender has nothing to do with him? I've told him most of this already but he's a very sensitive person, and insists that calling me ae or aer instead of my dead pronouns would hurt him deeply and compromise his values. It's so frustrating to have to fight him on this all the time (I don't have the resources to move out yet).

The thing is, he's AWARE that misgendering hurts and that continuing to misgender me will cost him our relationship. And he's broken into tears before, begging me not to cut him off because of this. He says he cares sO mUcH about his family, when he actively refuses to treat me with the basic respect he gives my cis family members.

I've suggested him calling me by they/them instead, apparently has the same effect. I've suggested him just not gendering me at all (using name only), but he's refused that too.

No matter what I say, he doesn't seem to hear me.

Sorry for length, but I need to get this off my chest.

Edit: Thank you all for the support and advice. It means a lot. You're wonderful, have a great day/night :)"	"Damn, sorry about your situation. 

It sounds like you realise he needs to respect you or he'll lose you, you're being realistic and maintaining your self-respect. All you can do now is wait to see if he'll set himself straight...and don't tolerate him knowingly misgendering in the mean time, you're already being gentle enough with him.
this part is really getting to me,  the way you said ""he cares so much about his family""  does he phrase it like that? does he ever say that he ""cares so much"" about YOU? or does he only care about the idea of looking like a supportive dad to outsiders. this really isn't on you, you have offered compromises. multiple in fact. but he has this irrational attachment to your dead pronouns and I don't want to accuse... but he might be hung up on you just being his child, not his son/daughter because there are specific rules and gender norms between dad and daughter/son that many people think cannot be interchangeable, let alone taking the gender binary out of the question entirely. you could prod him with more questions about why it hurts him and try to get to the root of it. but honestly, do exactly what you need to do to protect yourself and your mental/physical well-being. if that means cutting him off,,, I have a strong suspicion he'll care more about the social appearance, if he misses you and is still unwilling to acknowledge your gender and use your pronouns, it's a version of you that does not exist.
He is trying to manipulate you.

Edit: Added a verb
If someone repeatedly breaks boundaries they are not a healthy person in your life, I'm sorry op I understand what it's like. It sounds like he's gaslighting you
Sounds like he sees you as a possession more than a person. Like you're ""his"" family. Some dads be like that. They see family as something they were promised, or something they worked hard to get, the way that one might work for a good house or car and be rewarded for one's efforts with success, with a picture-perfect storybook to boast to friends about. It's a common side effect of the patriarchy or whatever. And pulling tears here isn't that far from a toddler's behaviour crying when someone wants to take away their toy dolls.

Live your own best life. His hurt is not your responsibility! But supporting you was his. He's the one who's broken the social contract here, not you.
They/them is a pronoun that works for any person of any gender. ""Who just blew through that red light?!? THEY must have been on THEIR phone!"" It's a catch-all. Everything else is someone requesting more specific pronouns, including people who prefer he/him or she/her over the ambiguous case. There is no reason to value he/him and she/her over ze/zir or ae/aer or Fae/faer. They're all the same value, the only thing is this culture brainwashes people into binary thinking and look where that gets us lmao.

If your parent refuses to understand this basic English concept in order to uphold their dumbass beliefs and continuously guilt trips you about having the feelings you do, I suggest retaliation. She probably won't like you misgendering her on a daily basis. But if preferred pronouns aren't respected in that house, then don't respect em. She can go cry by herself some more. Sometimes people are so self centric and have so little empathy that you have to show them how their actions hurt you for them to understand :/
That's not very nice of him... Here, sending positive vibes

-Buggo, AZ
He's manipulating you like crazy, oh no you hurt me you hurt me, I'm a victim. Reverse the victim emotional abuse and he's likely not aware he's doing it, but likely believes it'll mean he gets his way.

Tell him it logically follows that if it hurts you to be misgendered and it hurts him to gender you appropriately, then he'd rather you feel more pain and lose you than suffer a little bit himself using a different pronoun.

And that's fucked up to rather your kid hurt and lose the kid than suffer a little yourself and being a shitty unsupportive parent. You deserve better, and you can tell him until he's ready to suffer using a different word he doesn't deserve to be in your life.

My best to you ❤️
If it compromises his values so much to treat you with respect and prioritize your feelings on your identity that he refuses, then clearly having you in his life isn’t his priority. I know he doesn’t listen but goddamn I want to shake this man. Tell him caring doesn’t mean shit if he won’t *act* like it. If he cared, he’d respect. And if he says no, he really does care, well he’s given you no reason to believe him. He cares about a [assigned gender], not you.

You don’t have to say all that to him if you’re not comfortable, I’m just seething just reading this.
sounds like he's manipulating you op.
Yeah I feel you. I’m currently no contact with my parents for similar reasons. My mom thought I wasn’t being considerate of how difficult this all was for her, in spite of me offering many resources, offering kind reminders, all my siblings using my name and pronouns. 

This is such a sucky situation. Hang in there OP!
That is a pertically difficult diphthong (sliding vowel) Tell him his mouth muscles will strengthen.
compromises his values, huh? what are his values - to be an uncaring shithead? parents will really tell us they care, but not enough to conpromise their bullshit values... idk about your dad, but my mum can't even tell me what those values are, just that respecting my identity goes against them.
Sucks to be him I guess

While I am def biased coz I haven’t spoken to my father in almost a decade, I’m still gonna say it:

Fuck him. If your father is incapable of doing what’s right by you and is still trying to emotionally manipulate you to not disown him, then he is pretty clear about what is actually important to him.

Its not up to you to fix him, its up to him. And letting him stay in your life while he still doesn’t change is just giving him the excuse to not change.

Maybe never speaking to him for years will get him to change, maybe not. But in the end, you will not be the person being hurt by his actions, he will.
Hey my dad is being a piece of shit to me right now too and I'm in the same boat. Both our dads are normies apparently. Blugh. I'm sorry.
How do you even pronounce ae/ aer.I’m NB too but I can’t wrap my head around how to actually sound that out .…
I am sorry to hear that. And that I just complete disrespectful of your father
Sorry that’s just disgusting and bullshit excuses 😤😤 i’m so sorry you have to put up with that OP :((
If your dad can’t figure out how to use any of the options you’ve offered to use pronouns which you’re comfortable with, it’s clear he doesn’t really support/care about you. Keep that in mind with what info you share with him and other support you ask for.

Unrelated: this is the first I’ve heard of ae/aer pronouns-can anyone help me with pronunciation? Does it sound like “eye” and “air” like my brain tells me? Google will tell me how to use them but I’ve yet to see how to pronounce them
Thank you. It's nice to hear that I'm not being too pushy with this.
100% agreed. I would say an escalation is warranted if that is safe.
Yep, he phrases it like that. And every time I bring up the subject, he talks about how much he cares about me as well, but he seems hung up on the person he wants me to be, not the person I am. He won't give me a straight answer about why it hurts him, other than ""because you're a \[dead pronoun\].""  Thanks for the suggestions and the support, I appreciate it.
aww thanks :)
I just pronounce them like ay (as in play)/air, though I know for some there's a subtly different pronunciation for aer-- like in between air and ayer, I think?

honestly, if you are able to, bail. thats just guilt tripping you, and if he wont respect you enough to see who you are, then you need to respect yourself by removing a tumor.
that really sucks, dude. it's clear he doesn't care about you, but either his image as a perfect father or his idea of you as a perfect child.
That’s cool! I’ve learned something new today.
That’s a really shallow way of looking at things. “He doesn’t care about you”. It’s not helpful and probably not true.
ok i was potentially too harsh there lol, but like. however much he cares, he doesn't care as much about OPs feelings as about his 'values' or his 'perfect child'.

then again, maybe he really doesn't see how much harm it's causing OP. either way, the dad sucks."	vhqv2i	NonBinary	145	0.97	2022-06-21 23:36:53
i had a longer chat with my 4channy friend abt nb identities and..		"Did you tell him “I think you might be the only reasonable person on 4chan”?
how did this even happen??
I would be happy for you but I'm reALLY ANGRY ABOUT THE STATE OF YR NOTIFICATIONS. GET THEM SORTED
I actually frequent /lgbt/ a lot. I think the anti-enby people are kind of a vocal minority. Most people have been pretty accepting of me or just don’t care. 
What did you say? Or at least a TL;DR version pls 
and yes i know i am stupid and didn't blur the name properly shut up
I'm so happy for you :) 
are you leaking the new degrassi season rn? is this what's gonna happen w yael and baz?
I had this with such a friend of mine too. He’s more supportive than most allies I know now, the other day he sent me a message saying “I had some free time so I wanted to educate myself on pronouns” and he asked me a few questions to confirm his personal research. So proud of him 
is this a romeo and juliet
One of us gotta have the open mind!
They are the chosen one,
AND THE BATTERY TOO!!!!
😈
yea most people just turn up the edge for the memes
After i mentioned that I ID as nb he asked me whether I actually believe the whole 'multiple gender tumblr bullshit'. My main points where

 that it is not expected of him to understand it completely if he himself does not have to deal with that kind of stuff and all he is supposed to do is not be a dick about it

That 'tumblr sjws' often fail at communicating a point in a way which is not preachy and circlejerky and actually educates people

that it is impossible to explain in a way which would actually make him get it but basically that being refered to as a girl and treated like one makes me feel 'icky' but that gender identity for me is just a personal thing to explore with and not a thing i want to bother other people with (except for closest friends and i know not everyone has that option but whatever).

I have to point out that we were friends for quite a while before this which was the main reason he was actually willing to listen and respected my opinions. I have to admit i get a bit of a kick out of befriending these kinds of people and then educating them makes me feel a bit powerful lmaoo. 


I get a kick out of turning enbies into Real People for crunchy meme dudes online too. Like, going into hellish chat rooms, being a generally accepted person, then slowly getting them to realize I’m an enby and listening to their brains trying to reconcile the cognitive dissonance is pure gold.
holy shit that sounds incredible, so far i have been relying on finding these people in the wild. this sounds like much less effort."	9bo9kr	NonBinary	141	0.99	2018-08-30 22:56:14

"I Finally Understand ""Any Pronouns"""	"I've come to a realization regarding what I want from other people in regard to respecting my identity. My preferred pronouns are they/them, but I've begun to understand people who use ""any pronouns"" which I never questioned but also never understood. However, being friends with people who respect and accept me as being non-binary has shown me that even people who try make a lot of mistakes. Weirdly, it doesn't feel nearly as bad to be accidentally misgendered by people who I know accept and support my identity. As long as they're trying and use neutral language most of the time, I don't mind an occasional mix-up. The key thing I've realized is that I just want to be seen as non-binary rather than my AGAB. I would be fine with ""any pronouns"" from people who I know are supportive, but I don't want to give people a free pass to not make an effort."	"I go by any pronouns because none of them feel right, i think I have an issue with people referring to me in general lol
I use any. I’m genderfluid and I feel most like a many-faceted genderful being, all genders at once all the time. I contain multitudes and all that. My ideal would be that people switch between them, I think that’s fun, but I have found that tends to TERRIFY my cis allies lol… instead people seem to pick one and exclusively use that which I guess is the next best thing.
I use my agab pronouns, and honestly i would be okay with whatever pronouns. it’s a personal choice just because in my own head, the pronouns someone else calls me doesn’t change how I feel about my own gender presentation. i stress that this is my own journey im talking about, and everyone’s mileage will certainly vary
I use any. I want to be seen as both and i prefer that people just use their first assumption of me.
I use they/them pronouns, but I suppose I would love to not care to the degree that any pronouns would be good. Because I don't like to give gender legitimacy or give language that power over me. But I do care. But I tend to just let strangers assume whatever they assume.
the conversations in the comments is why I put they/ them instead of any/all. I'd rather people use they/them exclusively than she/her (my agab), even though it would be nice to get the occasional he/him. I'm genderfluid and genuinely don't mind which pronouns people use, I just don't want to be referred to as she/her ALL the time!
This is the only reason I say ""any pronouns except she/her"". I know if I gave that option a lot of people would opt for that without a second thought. If someone is genuinely supportive about my gender experience, then them saying she occasionally (not always, just sometimes mixed in with other pronouns) would not bother me. I typically say ""he/they"", in spaces with more gender diversity I say ""he/they/it"" or ""any pronouns except she"". I've also offered to be people's learning curve to get the hang of neopronouns or it/its or they/them pronouns for their other friends or such. Because I don't mind these pronouns and if they slip up when talking about me I'm not hurt by it. They use me to practice using these ""unusual"" pronouns, they get used to it faster and are better able to adjust for their friend, who actually *does* feel hurt by slip ups. So yeah. I would use any pronouns too but as everything stands right now, I know that if people had the option to use she/her they would never use anything else so I say ""anything except she/her""
Yeah, I use they/them but I'm leaning a twinge towards not caring? But not enough to actively say 'hey yeah you can use any pronouns for me'.
I've gotten to the point that I know who I am and that's enough for me.
I use “any pronouns” on the surface because people are gonna people and I don’t have the energy to care. What others perceive is what they perceive. I know what I am and when I actually meet people who I care to get to know more (or Im gonna be around them regularly) then I tell them I strongly prefer they/them. 

Although, after medically transitioning (haven’t been able to start) Id like to be exclusively they/she in the future when Im more femme leaning androgynous presentation wise. I know presentation/expression isn’t necessary for identity, but for me it’s important in my journey that the identity I have in mind matches my presentation/expression and vice versa.
I used to use any pronouns, recently I've only been using he/him and she/her because 1- the neutral pronouns in my native language don't really make me feel anything besides maybe start a fight between a cadually transphobic person in the vicinity and I don't feel.it fits my gender identity and 2- the neutral pronoun in english it's just so normal to me I don't.even realize people are using it so I don't feel like it's worth mentioning

Overall it's just about comfort, I have non binary friends who use all because they like all and want to be called by all. I don't mind they/them pronouns in English and I like it, but I would rather you call me either he/him or she/her in my native language
This is so relatable, I’d be fine hearing he/him occasionally if it didn’t just mean any and all strangers would just default to only using them
I use any pronouns but prefer they/them and neopronouns since it's most accurate to how I perceive myself. However she/her honors my connection to womanhood, he/him honors my desires of medically transitioning and transmasculinity. I dunno sometimes I feel inclined towards certain pronouns but at the end of the day I'm some flavor of nonbinary and any pronouns honor that.
I believe its not always like that, yes there are many people that think like you, my gf is one of them, but I have seen lots of cis people who say ""any pronoums"" just cause they really dont care or have no preference. What I never understood about those cis people is that they usually only refer to themselves in their agab pronoum, and dont really use the others, in those cases I think it doesnt make any sense to say it.
As someone who is gender-fluid (less so as I start to pass as a girl more and more consistently although I’ll always have a deeply boyish side) I go by any pronouns because sometimes I intentionally pass as a girl and sometimes Im intentionally presenting in boy mode and I’m comfortable doing both. At some point I think my pronouns will switch to exclusively she/her once I’m deep into my transition and (hopefully) stealth, but for now I’m comfortable with anything because I’m pretty in control of what gender people see me as.
I go by any/all because they all feel right to me at different times but I'm not going to expect whoever I'm speaking with to know if I'm feeling more femme, masc, or anywhere in between or separate when I don't even know myself half the time. As long as people are being respectful, I'm genuinely good with whatever.
I use he/they but I think the only reason I dislike she pronouns is because I know that the people who use it for me are perceiving me as a cis woman and that makes me feel dysphoric. If I knew I wasn’t being seen that way, I think I’d be an any pronouns person.
To me, ""any pronouns"" means ""I sincerely don't care how you perceive me and any pronouns work for me"".
In theory I'm fine with any pronouns, because it's like referring to me by just one letter of my name - incomplete, but not fundamentally unapplicable? Like, call me anything but late for dinner. 

But at the same time I really loathe people defaulting to pronouns based on my perceived gender and I hate having my AGAB's pronouns used for me because it inevitably feels like they're just calling me what they think they see. 

In a vacuum of zero transphobia and nobody being shitty/weird about my gender, my genitals, my pronouns, or my chosen name: any pronouns. 

In reality: they/them or ji/jer (xi/xer?) are the ones that don't put my ears back.
Tbh the right people won't slip up and will be able to see you as who you are.
I use any pronouns because I know that the people who care about me see me as me and for everyone else in the world I don’t want to share that part of me. I never have to correct people on my pronouns  because you can’t get them wrong.
I don’t think I’d ever be okay with any pronouns. Being referred to as they/them or my agab pronouns are typically fine with me. After reading some comments, I can understand why those who feel very fluid with their gender may be okay with any pronouns.
Q: How would you like for me to refer to you?

A: Don’t.
Time to start using no pronouns!/half-joking

Although I use any pronouns, no pronouns has a special place in my heart, lol.
Then you can go by no pronouns
yeah like just don't talk about me, idk. everything is uncomfortable and I hate it
I felt this in my soul
Hey, I feel the same way! I wish people would switch it up, but I also feel like that's too much to ask. 

Also, being amab (for me) makes it difficult when 90% of people refer to me with he/him. Having a whole vulnerable conversation around how I tell if people respect my identity and that I'd like other pronouns even though I'm any/all is just... exhausting. Plus, it doesn't change their behavior half the time :/
Exactly this! I really do feel like all pronouns fit me but I wish everyone mixed and matched them all the time ahaha, that would be my perfect world. At least my partner does, that'll be good enough for now
Yes I feel this! I used to not care about pronouns and all anyone used was she/her and I realized how sad that made me. So now nobody gets to use those for me.
Okay but that was me before my egg fully cracked. I was ambivalent towards my gender. I said stuff like ""any pronouns are fine"" even though I still basically identified as cis female. I just hadn't sat down and really thought about it. I used she/her pronouns as a default out of sheer habit, if nothing else. 

I'm not saying this is true for all cis people who say they're fine with ""any pronouns"" but it definitely could be the case for some. If you're ambivalent, and haven't really sat down and asked yourself questions, you just default to what you're used to.
Same!
*I* slip up sometimes based on how others talk about me. I have friends/a partner who are >95% accurate with my pronouns and even they make mistakes. It is impossible to expect perfection with gender neutral pronouns and language given the current contextual factors of society.
And that’s the coolest fucking thing. If you want to have every pronoun, you can. And if you don’t… then don’t. 
We are free, no longer constrained by the incredibly dull binary system.
I'm not genderfluid, but I'm all too familiar with the devastation of people refusing to view you as anything other than a ""man"" with all of the harmful stereotypes that such entails. It's exhausting and incredibly disrespectful.
Right?? I feel like I can't be **me**, I'm always the son or the older brother. Like even if my body perfectly represented my gender identity, people still wouldn't recognize **me**
There are people who will recognize and value you for you, it's just unfortunately difficult to find them. It is worth it to keep trying though. I have some great people in my life who help keep me from feeling worthless or unaccepted as who I am. You deserve the same.

Enby needs to be redefined	"I find myself and many others putting ourselves on a box. Non-binary doesn’t mean that if you’re afab you wear all masculine clothes. It doesn’t mean amab people wear skirts and have long hair and beards. I feel like the nb community is pressured to fit these dress codes just like females and males. Not that these stereotypes that are real people are bad, they are just what most people assume is to be, Even us.

I myself an afab just started wearing dresses again after a year or two of hatred towards them because thy were “feminine”. It’s a piece of fabric sowed into a pattern. Not a gender, I have to remind myself this. I want you to remind yourself this. Fabric isn’t your identity. Wear make up, wear dresses, wear gym shorts, wear high heels, wear tuxes, redefine what we are stereotyped for. We are people, not a copy and paste. 

Non-binary is an identity, not a style, not a person. It’s an identity of a person who chooses to use gender neutral pronouns and so forth. We are an umbrella term for our people of the gender noncom-forming and genderless. 

Thank you, 
Dev

it’s currently 2:30am"	"I agree that groups can sometimes end up creating a new ""standard"" for themselves. I noticed this after The L Word came out and suddenly the standard was either Shane or Bette - suddenly, there was a way to be an attractive lesbian. Same with nonbinary - there seems to be a way that a higher proportion of folks present similiarly. With that said though, we are a social species of animal, and a certain amount of absorption of the presentation of others with whom we might identify is normal, natural, to be expected.  
What's not okay is when folk start telling others how to be.   


I once had a nonbinary ""friend"" say to me ""Oh, you shaved your legs. I wouldn't expect that from you."" ... and I was like... wtf, I'm genderless, leg shaving is completely irrelevant, like why are you even commenting. We definitely, definitely as a community need to recognise nb in our many forms. With that said, I don't find this subreddit particularly bad for pushing a standard on folks.   


Any backstory as to what prompted the rant? You're clearly feeling it, and I'm interested what happened!!
that's why we're non-binary. We stray out of the norms. We're the people out of the box. Let's stay that way. Wear whatever you fucking want, clothes weren't sewn with a peen or a vag.
That's a really interesting perspective. For me the thing that made the nonbinary label fit so well is that nobody can define what it means to you. No matter how you're presenting yourself, you're still nonbinary. The clothes and appearance aren't about expressing your gender, they're about expressing yourself and who you are. At least that's how I've seen it
Thanks for your rant. I agree with all you said. We should all be free to dress and present as we want and not as others think we should look like. Roll on the day that gender is abolished.
I think the reason so many of us choose to wear clothing of the opposite AGAB is because we want people to second guess our gender based on our presentation. As afab, I wear men's clothes because I'd much rather have a stranger call me sir (and better pockets lol), but if I were to wear a dress, I'd get ma'amed and have ""she"" used in reference me and hearing that makes my skin want to turn inside out.

If you're out to everyone in your life, maybe the occasional misgendering from strangers is ok, but me confusing strangers is my only form of validation since my uber conservative family just thinks I dress this way cause I'm a ""tom-boy"". 

There have been way more ""you can dress like your agab and be nonbinary"" posts lately and that's great but like. Fuck. some of us need that androgyny cause presenting as my agab is dysphoric as hell.
I’m looking at this post and all the comments and just silently going “Yes!! 🙌🏾” in my mind. You guys really get it man.
Thank you, a huge part of my continued gender questioning as a non-binary person is that I don't look like your typical amab enby. I just wear the same clothing and hair that I always have, not ridiculous facial hair and makeup and outfits.

People either assume I'm just a cis male or even an afab enby. I just want to be seen as myself.

For a very long time there was no  distinction between sexuality and the understanding of gender and the impact that had on sex/gender roles. You can see that with sexual inversion theory of homosexuality where gay men and lesbian women were understood as inverts as and to quote,"" people who appeared physically male or female on the outside, but felt internally that they were of the ""opposite"" [anatomical sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_sex) (according to the [binary view of gender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_binary)). Therefore, same-sex desires and attraction were explained as ""latent heterosexuality"". Bisexuals, on the other hand, were considered inherently hermaphroditic with male and female parts. Asexuals or neuters were considered to have no sexual function due to a lack of concrete gender identity. Some modern day theories that bolster themselves based on 19th-20th century sexology are the Blanchard typology(homosexual transsexuals vs. autogynephiles) and the Harry Benjamin  scale. Biology has never really been the study of human sexual practices or identity. The term here is more based on sexology than biology, I'd wager. In many ways the sexologist definition is the more relevant one in terms of societal functioning.
This made me snort out loud oh my god
Squeaker in bed, growler on stage!
Lol I guarantee we got dealt the same ruined society you did
Don't blame us, blame Johnathon Non-Binary whom, in 1923 invented non-binary.
This. It isn’t used in an outdated way, just the scientific way. Tbh if I could make one change to the LGBT+ community it would be changing asexual => nonsexual or a similar term which doesn’t garner that kind of confusion.
I thought polysexual was attractions to many but not all genders and polyamory was multiple partners??
I completely overlooked the term asexual being used in a biological sense, whoops😅 But yeah I agree, in current times asexual is used in multiple ways depending on what community or context you're in, and same with other prefixes and suffixes, so it can get kind of confusing
Thanks for commenting this! It's interesting how meanings change over time as our understanding of gender and sexuality grows. I almost hesitated posting this photo because I'm not knowledgable on the history of the term, so I appreciate information like this!
That's the spirit!

It's the issue of using the same word (sexual) for concept relating to biological sex and to sexual behaviour. 

In other languages, such as French, the first concept uses another word, equivalent to ""sexuated"". (Sexué = having a or relating to the biological sex; Sexuel = relating to sexual practices and behavior)

Struggles being nonbianary but feminine.	"Um, I'm bad at phrasing things so bare with me please.

After a lot of experimentation, and research, I know for a fact that I'm just non-bianary, and only comfortable with they/them pronouns.

However I know I look/dress in a more traditionally feminine nature, which obviously can cause a lotta misgendering.

While this itself isn't a problem, since I already know that nobody will automatically know my pronouns, but its afterwards when people look at me weird, or just downright refuse to use them and just refer to me as she/her.

I've explained it, but a lot of people I'm friends, and even are part of the lgbt themselves just don't really either """"believe"""" me, or just don't yse them altogether.

How I dress doesn't define my gender.
How long my hair is doesn't define my gender.

I like skirts, because I like how they look.
I like Ponytails, because I like how they look.


I just sometimes feel like these are the people who are supposed to know what this stuff feels like, yet most of the people who use my prefered pronouns are other trans people, so idk anymore. I'm grateful to have close friends who do respect my identity, but I just feel a bit betrayed (if thats the right word?) on people who I've explained it to a few times, Idk though, maybe I'm just being dramatic.

Thank you if you read this far, I just had to get this off my chest.


Edit:
I highly doubt anyone will see this old post again, but after a weird day, I was just looking back on all the positivity and support yall commented and just- MY HEART!!!-

Thank you so much for literally everything! <333
<Insert that meme of kermit holding a phone with heart emojis, lol>


And after a lot of time, communication, and a hell of a lotta thinking, I followed yall's advise and thought how my real friends are the ones that are understanding, and actually respect me too.

And while it sucks to have lost wuite a few people I used to really like, its better to nip the bud now, before it just grows into something more toxic.


And to retrack my statement earlier, a lot of people im close with (some became closer since cutting off others) are indeed cis, and have no hesitation or problems using my prefered name and pronouns!!!


While I know a good chunk of people aint gonna try to understand me, or want to, ah well, I've still got a miniture army of weirdos I hang out with :)))))"	"Oh, it broke my heart. People who I thought cared for me in actuality didn’t care for me that much. And it hurt so bad. I lost people I thought I wouldn’t because despite begging them to get my pronouns right, they refused to stating it was too hard or too confusing.

It’s awful and I’m sorry you have to experience it.
Always remember: You don't owe anyone androgyny. If other people don't like it, they can go home and cry about it.
I get this too. I'm agendered AFAB, but I present as feminine because I like dresses. Generally I don't expect people to know or use my preferred pronouns, so I'm always pleasantly surprised when I make/have a friend who respects them. But I'm older, so maybe it's just that these things don't bother me so much anymore. Respect given is respect earned, misgendering mistakes happen, and no one can ruffle your feathers without your consent.

I see you, you glorious person. You got this.
I don't really have advice but am in the same boat. I commend you for being brave enough to tell people your pronouns, I generally haven't been and am only out with family and even then only my fiancés family because mine isn't as accepting. 
I try to surround myself with that part of the family that is accepting and it helps my mental health a lot. Just be around the people who get you it's worth it.
i’m gonna say it, it feels like the only ones who respect  pronouns despite a certain presentation are trans people. i mean my own friend group didn’t want to call me a different name, my female best friend is bisexual and didn’t want too. my male best friend, who is cishet, kept saying how he thought it was just a phase because i dress feminine. i’ve explained it all to them and they got it eventually and have now stopped doing that, but still it feels like the only people who don’t question are other trans folk
I feel you, I don't dress feminine but still get misgendered a lot since I'm short/large chested. All I can say is that my friends who care about me respect my pronouns. All I had to say is that it mattered a lot to me and they did it. Sometimes they make mistakes but they correct and apologize, in one case a friend kept messing up and all my friends at the same time corrected them. They later reached out to apologize, they were having a bad brain day and felt awful.   


What I'm trying to say is, the people who care about you should do what makes you happy and when they mess up they should apologize. Your pronouns being respected is the bare minimum. Them not believing you is bullshit, they aren't the gender police. Like I know you can't make them respect your pronouns but I certainly would start questioning if someone really respected and cared about me if they kept disrespecting me that way and would be very hurt. I'm sorry your friends act that way, it's one thing if it's a stranger or an acquaintance but these are your FRIENDS. You aren't questioning their identity, they should reciprocate.
Gender =/= gender presentation.
I feel for you, I am afab and present feminine about 50% of the time (rest is jeans and hoodies) and I am too heavy to hide my boobs and hips anyway. It's frustrating. And folks not taking being nonbinary serious if you don't present way x or y... they suck. I am sorry you were hurt by those suckers.
I can relate to this. So very much. As an AFAB femme presenting NB, I feel like an imposter saying I am a part of the lgbtqia+ community. I am in a heteronormative presenting relationship (cis-gendered male husband) and it’s hard for me because I know I am also pan-sexual (I wouldn’t care what is or anyone’s gender or sexuality is, I understand that now that I am comfortable with myself I do not have the ability to explore that side of me). 

It’s seems like while at work, I can have my pronouns, and perhaps people respect them they don’t understand. I get misgendered because I like makeup sometimes (I worked really hard to become good at it and amass a decent collection dangit)! And it sucks. 

But I know who I am and how I feel inside. I know that there is a fluid nature and if asked I will explain but otherwise I don’t owe that to anyone.

It’s weird and my empathy extends to you. You aren’t alone and I wish people understood and respected that how we identify internally is how we wish to be identified externally, regardless of their expectations and judgments. I hope things improve for you and for all of us in this position as well
Any friends who dont respect you arent actually friends. 

I'm so sorry the people arouns you are making things so difficult. You're nonbinary as hell in those skirts n ponytails though! Those people just dont know how to not shove people in boxes based off of their idea of How x Type of Person Looks. 

Im really glad youre so secure in who you are and aren't letting their nonsense change hoe you view yourself!
I feel you. I have big boobs, wide hips, ass, and long hair. My voice is in the higher register. 

Hair is not gendered. Body features are not gendered. Clothing is not gendered. Make-up is not gendered. Anyone can look any way and be any gender. I’m non-binary but unless I try to hide my body, alter my voice, and cut my hair, some people will aways see me as a “woman.” I don’t experience my features as gendered, my body is just my body. 

I can’t make other people see me for who I am inside, but I can try. After a good reasonable effort, and someone still doesn’t get it, it’s okay to leave them behind or be upset if they are close to you. You get to decide who you are, not them. You don’t owe it to anyone to change how you like to dress or do your hair just so if fits into THEIR idea of what non-binary is supposed to look like. Fuck that. It’s transphobic as fuck.
Some people are cunts, unfortunately.
I feel that! Some days I’m wearing a dress which to most people is considered “feminine” some days I have the aesthetic of a plant loving vintage boy, but I always remember my gender and everyone’s gender is NOT how we look, it’s how we feel about ourselves and how we personally identify. Gender cannot be seen, it can be expressed, but that is not a definitive way to visually identify someone’s gender. The gender you tell others and the pronouns you use are to be taken at face value without question. No one ever has the right to try to poke holes in who you know you are! Be you and be queer. It’s easier said then done to say f them, but those who question you aren’t worth your time and energy. Keep those who respect your identity close and those who don’t at more of a distance. You deserve to be seen as who you are! Which is a lovely non binary person. Keep on keeping on :)
absolutely gross you experience this, but i get it :(. i was out about being NB years before deciding to take hrt, and if i’m being completely transparent, the social aspect was legitimately a part of it. and hrt did make a difference in how people treated me. i almost wish i could turn it on and off now (the changes i’ve got), to be able to tell who would be respectful even if i didn’t fit their standards of being “trans enough”. 

fuck anyone who claims to support us but then treats people who aren’t on hrt or who dress non-conformingly as “lesser” trans people. they are not allies, and honestly now that i am on hrt one of my favorite things to do is shut other people down on that real quick (when they’re trying to be all “well they don’t do enough” or “don’t you think they’re *different* than your case though?”)

sorry for the tired rant, but hope it makes sense. tldr fuck those people, and i’m sorry you have to put up with all their bs. you’re not being dramatic, you’re having a human reaction to everyone around you being dicks
This post was honestly kinda comforting for me to read today. I’m AFAB and present differently day to day on the entire spectrum of gender presentations.

Today I presented feminine…very feminine. I got dressed this morning and spent time putting a nice braid in my hair, wearing a sweater I really like, putting cute leg warmers under my boots…before I left the house I felt really cute.

But the second I got into public, I suddenly started imagining myself through everyone else’s eyes, and all I saw was a girl.

Queue dysphoria wooo!
I completely relate. I'm actually wearing a skirt right now. I'm non-binary and use they/them but most people just don't understand since I look so feminine. My hair is on the longer side and I dress in skirts and other traditionally feminine clothes. Some people refuse to use my pronouns all together. I understand slip ups but straight up refusal is different. I assume you've already tried this but maybe respond a bit more intense. I don't quite know how else to deal with it since it's a reoccurring problem for me as well. I hope people learn to respect you and your pronouns.
You’re not being dramatic, people are blatantly disrespecting you and that’s not cool and transphobic. I’m AFAB (demiboy) and I get so frustrated when people who know my pronouns refuse to correct themselves or tell me it’s not a big deal because it IS. I give folks leeway because I use all pronouns except she/her but when they deliberately use those pronouns, it’s just disrespectful.
I'm a masc NB and I get the same issues, for me it's not so much how I look on the outside but how I feel on the inside but, some don't understand that...
I totally understand your situation. I'm in a very similar spot. It's such a disheartening thing to think that if you do what makes you happy, the world will see you as female. 😔
I know how this feels dear! I'm a bigenderflux nonbinary trans woman and while I appreciate being gendered female when I feel that way, its tough when I feel more nonbinary and others don't understand my preferred pronouns and gender shifts :(
People usually equate gender presentation and gender identity... so i'd usually assume that they got that mixed up and start from there  


So for me, i'd show them a pic of the genderbread person, and then explain how my gender identity is different from my gender presentation, and use analogies that they understand like, when a man puts on a dress, he is still a man in a dress, so you are still a nonbinary person in a dress. and also I'd tell them that the perception of gender change so in other times or culture dresses and long hair wouldnt be considered feminine, like how ancient china everyone wears robes and have long hair  


if they still don't agree well... it's probably down to whether they respect you or truly care about you or not  


hope that helps!
Same. 

I discovered that you have a ""feminine face"" then I will change the pronoun that I've been using all along with you! 

:/ Don't be that person.
>they refused to stating it was too hard or too confusing

Honestly this is such a ridiculous excuse, it's just code for they don't care to try.
Agreed from my experience!!!
I respectfully disagree. I know a LOT of non trans people who would never in a million years question someone’s preferred pronouns. I hope more of these people come your way in the near future.
I've also just have people say I have a lot of sisters and I'm only used to saying she since you're basically a girl. I was definitely upset but I told them it's ok to mess up. They then said they would just call me she/her. Youre definitely not being dramatic btw."	yr3xau	NonBinary	133	0.97	2022-11-10 03:20:14

My friend once called me an “ethereal space deity” and that’s been my go-to response since then
Me: Sometimes.
Them: I mean what's your gender?
Me: I'm a villain.
Them: No, I mean how do you identify?
Me: Evil.
Them: No, I mean what's in your pants?
Me: Doom.
In grade school a really young kid asked me, ""Are you a her or a he?"" I replied, ""You don't need to know!"" After being misgendered quite a bit I was over it and got snarky (back then I identified as female because that was all I had ever known). Today I would probably answer with a simple yes or no.

I didn't know what the Magnus Archives was until I saw your comment. I looked it up and it seems like something I would enjoy. Thanks for accidentally introducing me into something!
All the time and they're super awkward about it. There's an almost visible wave of confusion spreading in all directions when someone isn't sure how to gender me. 

'Madam... I'm sorry, sir! Or is it madam..?' - at this moment everyone who was listening kinda peeks and checks me out because **they need to know**. I usually answer 'it's ok' and just let people call me whatever they want. It only confuses them more, but in my culture it's weird to interact with strangers a lot, so they just give up. I kinda got used to it tbh.
Yes. Ive only had it asked to me once, but it was asked to me nonetheless. It does happen.
Long before I knew I was non-binary, I once had a substitute teacher ask me in front of my middle school class if I was a boy or a girl. You could tell it kind of slipped out and she wasn’t trying to be mean, but you can imagine how everyone started laughing and joking about it after that. She did apologize after class though, and she sort of scolded the kids she heard making jokes.
I tend to find it’s mostly little kids who (offten) have very stereotypical veiws of boy and girl

Oh, I love the approach of just soothing them as opposed to answering at all — it's okay, honey. things are confusing sometimes, aren't they? *pat pat*
I do try to give more explanatory answers to little kids asking. They deserve to be educated about gender even if their parents won't do it for them. 🙄

I'm a doctor with an NB patient. What extra steps can I take?	"I'm a primary care doc who had an early puberty NB patient establish care today. I recognize that as a cis man there are things I don't experience. I want to be as supportive as I can be, and have done my fair share of training, but want to ask for more.  Things I have done so far:

 * Introduced myself with my own pronouns

 * Used they/them and had staff do same

 * Kicked parents out for gender identity discussion

 * Validated feelings of frustration with parental ignorance


Please tell me what things doctors did to help you feel welcome. Or give me your worst experiences so I make sure those never come near them (my patient).
(Mods, I read the rules and searched the archives, couldn't find a similar question)."	"that sounds like a good start, omg! maybe also follow their lead in regards to which words they use to talk about their body (or just ask when appropriate). for example, some folx have their own labels for their genitals. also remember that some enbies have surgeries and some enbies don't, some enbies need hrt and some enbies don't, etc. but tbh, it sounds like you're kicking butt so far? simple validation can go a long way, especially when society itself is binarist. i'll come back if i think of more things to write. also, i hope you're having a rad day, you cool human
You are an amazing doctor im glad to see people like you
The stuff you have mentioned is all great and I really appreciate your commitment to doing right by your patient. As a primary care doctor your role may be more about making helpful referrals and making sure your patient gets the expert care they need if they pursue a medical transition. It’s great to be supportive and affirming like you are being but it’s also important to not make everything all about gender all the time, especially as a primary care doctor. If the patient is coming in for a non gender related issue [you don’t need to make it about their gender](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/07/09/feature-the-dangers-of-trans-broken-arm-syndrome/) but you seem self aware enough to know where that line is.
I’m so glad you’re asking! My only 1st person medical community complaint is pathologizing low-zero libido. This isn’t specifically a non-binary thing, but they sometimes co-occur. No libido, ED, and the psychosocial consequences of showing non-masculine sexual stereotypes held me within a depression diagnosis, and we all were misdirected. Although I performed heterosexuality for a couple decades, I’ve now spent 5 years feeling totally comfortable as a sex-repulsed asexual person. Not missing out, not malfunctioning, just ACE.  

Again, I really appreciate that you’re asking the question!
I don't have anything to add, but wanted to say thank you for being so supportive and willing to learn. You're a true ally.

One thought that doesn't have anything to do with the treatment of the patient per se: Do you have gender neutral restrooms at your practice?
As a closeted trans junior doctor who doesn’t yet feel comfortable coming out to their colleagues...thank you! Together we can improve care/lives/outcomes for individuals of all gender identities x 🥲☺️
Thank you for caring and using your power for good! Having an allies in a position of authority, especially acknowledging that the medical/scientific community has had a huge part in pathologizing our existence in the past, is so important and might even help their parents see the light.

I think the best thing you can do, honestly, is just normalize it—things that are normal aren’t a big deal, and being NB isn’t either. I would also say that, although you are a doctor, please don’t assume that being NB or trans in general requires any kind of medical intervention unless your patient indicates that’s what they specifically want. Hormone therapy and surgeries are an important part of a lot of trans people’s journeys, but the mainstream narrative makes it seem like bodily dysphoria IS being trans (I think because the “in the wrong body” narrative feeds into the way cis people often equate sex with gender and expect trans people to want to pass as a cis male or female), but it’s not. I’m NB, and perfectly comfortable with my body as it is, I just behave, dress, and want to socialize a little differently than was expected at birth.

Anyway, thanks again, you rock.
This is so absolutely amazing! You're doing a wonderful job! Generally there is not much you can/need to do. Sadly the lgbtq+ community has experienced so much hate that the most basic human decency is the absolute best a person can give us. By being nice and respectful to your patients identity you are doing so much! If it's possible and needed another great thing you could do is check about the bathroom situation. Many Enbys feel uncomfortable in both womens and mens restrooms, so if you don't have that already and are able to establish that, that would be great! Or in a check in paper include a pronoun section.

Oh and a very simple thing that I really love are stickers. I know a grocery store which has a little rainbow sticker on their door and every time I see it I feel so happy. Something like this or maybe a short sentence on your website makes clear that you are lgbtq+ friendly and will provide proper care eventhough the patient might be trans (or under the umbrella). Sadly that is something a lot of us have to check, because many countries allow doctors to refuse care to trans patients...
Doc, I am not non-binary myself although am an ally and parent of a non-binary child. I did want to share with you a video of a presentation by Dr. Will Powers who is, I believe, located in Michigan. This long video gives great perspective on how to accommodate NB and trans patients. After basically starting with one LGBT patient and learning how to accommodate them, he now has more than he can handle. I don’t know how controversial or not he is, but he made me wish I were a physician—if I were, I would definitely reach out to him to collaborate. I thought he may be a good resource/contact. What country/state are you located in? https://youtu.be/fefu33e8O-0
Fucking awesome doctor :)
Can I hug you? Because you're amazing. Thank you!!
Can you be my doctor? 😂
That honestly sounds great. Asking their preference and making them feel comfortable is the best thing you can do
I think you are doing great! I’m non-binary and currently a psychiatry resident in PA. I’m really happy to see my colleagues being supportive. You mentioned your patient is young, but you could potentially familiarize yourself with gender affirming resources in you or area and take a look at WPATH standards of care (wpath.org), although this is sometimes talked about in Med schools with particularly inclusive curriculum. 

Thanks again for being great and helping people to not see physicians exclusively as propagators of cishet narratives.
I believe what you are doing is great!!!

I wish that there are doctors in my area that I would feel comfortable with coming out too
Bless you so much! Your patients are really lucky to have you as their doc!
I’m crying reading this. Just wanted to tell you you’re doing a great job. It’s so nice to know that there are primary care docs out there like you.
Awesome! Maybe consider asking them what language they feel comfortable using when discussing secondary/primary sex characteristics. I was in the ED for a UTI and i expressed discomfort with using the word “vagina” so the nurse called it my “lady parts” instead. It was one of the most humiliating moments of my life. I reported her to the patient complaint line for that ridiculousness.
I think one of the biggest issues I had came from insurance. My doctor had to send in a pre-authorization for it, and my insurance rejected it because they only cover two specific doses. The office was told this, but they didn't tell me until I called and asked, when a letter came in the mail from the insurance company (three weeks from the initial pre-auth submission).

I imagine insurance will be an issue for nb and trans people for the great foreseeable future, but the doctors offices can help

Edit: spelling
This probably won't be needed for a young adolescent, but one thing my gay cis doctor did was spontaneously try to make her safer sex forms more inclusive. She's asking, Are you sexually active with men? Women? (Slight pause) or... Other people?

It was so heartwarming honestly. I'm not too shameful when it comes to discussing my sexual health, but this really made me trust her. Like, it makes sense that my safer sex options/reproductive stuff for activities with sperm would be different than without, but other things like consent or libido, it wouldn't matter.
I just really want to let you know how much I wish I had a doctor like you as a nonbinary teen with chronic illnesses. I don’t really see a lot of responses getting into that subset of treatment, so I’ll just share some of my experiences as a nonbinary person who has a chronic illness (although most of this also applies to acute illnesses or even things like a simple cold). 

firstly, every single symptom I’ve had has been attributed, at one point or another, to my being nonbinary and being on hormone suppressors to halt puberty. For context, i have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and POTS- my symptoms are absolutely not attributable to my Histrelin implant (not to mention that I have had symptoms long before I got that). Doctors generally have a very strong tendency to correlate any illnesses to being on hormone therapy, so I would heavily suggest double-checking yourself if your first instinct is to blame a symptom on someone’s identity and the treatment that they pursue for that identity. as a general guideline, if gender and hormones wouldn’t be brought up in a conversation for a cis person, don’t bring it up unless your patient does first. 

secondly, if you make a mistake with pronouns, really, it’s not a big deal. apologize, correct yourself, move on. We understand that it just happens sometimes and as long as it’s not a repeated issue, it’s usually fine. now, that’s not to say it doesn’t make us uncomfortable, so definitely do make an attempt, but making it awkward by halting a conversation to profusely apologize does no one any good. 

third, mental health in the trans community is definitely a huge issue, and probably the only exception to my first point. I would recommend being especially vigilant about mental health with this patient (and if you don’t already, please have their parents leave the room for that type of conversation too). If, as I did, your patient ends up going to an inpatient facility.. i actually don’t have advice here, just know that hospitals are horrific for non-cis people. i can tell plenty of horror stories. again, though, try not to frame it as a “mental illness because of gender” just as two things that coexist and interconnect. 

finally i just want to emphasize how much i appreciate you reaching out to this sub. That’s truly incredible. 

Since I don’t really see any other comments from a nonbinary teenager that has a lot of experience with hospitals and doctors, feel free to ask any questions specific to that too!
I'm trying to put all my ""book learnin' "" to use, but making sure patient care always comes before my ego. I've read so many horror stories of unsupported sexual minorities and want to curve this young person's journey away from that.
I'm glad to be here. We are getting better curricula today on LGBT+ issues, but there's still so many that shy away from what they don't know.
Thanks for the link, the title made me chuckle and the body was interesting.  I think I will have to delineate for myself what I refer out for because I am broadly trained and my gut response is to want to do everything (except surgery, I hate standing that long), but I recognize that isn't always the best approach. Thank you for your input.
So you feel your asexuality was essentially misdiagnosed as/lumped in with depression?  I think so many cishet providers assume their sexual experience is universal, and anything otherwise must be distressing (and therefore diagnosable).  What finally helped you let go of that 'pressure' for sexual interest?
We are a small clinic with the minimum number of bathrooms, and do not as of yet. I had not even thought about this, thank you. I will be talking with my director about what we can do.
CA, USA. I'm lucky enough to be supported by my organization, and not have to fight upstream so to speak. Still, there is always more that can be done. Thank you for the video, I will watch it once I can carve some time.
Wpath looks great.  I've heard of it but not had time to delve more deeply. Thanks for reminding me of it.
We're out here! There are dozens of us! Dozens! /reference
Wow, that's some antiquated language. Starting this practice now: what DO you prefer to call your respective sex characteristics?
Oh goodness do I hate insurance. They purposefully make it as arcane and confusing as possible to pay the absolute minimum.  It's confusing even to doctors.
Thank you for sharing your experience. I'm sorry that you were treated this way by medical professionals. I know that there is a lot of literature out there on LGBT/NB mental health, and I'm strongly of the opinion that it is predominently caused by society and support persons not accepting and demonizing (sometimes literally).  Given my own crappy parents, it's something I can empathize with at least a little. 

POTS often gets a bad reputation as a diagnosis of last resort - what was your experience with it's symptoms?
oh dang, once word gets out in your local trans/enby community, you are gonna be in demand, my friend. it's really heartening to see this and i hope more young enbies get cool drs like you
Yes, and I still kind of hold a grudge for cishet normative mental health diagnostic and treatment plans. Consistency was the main factor that “convinced me”, along with a lack of discomfort over feeling asexual. It helps that I feel sex-repulsed rather than ambivalent. EDIT: Building asexuality starting intermittently, mostly constant starting 2010-ish, then in 2015 became convinced it was real and “came out”, unchanged sex-repulsed asexuality since then. 

I’m now 46, so my anecdote is not super relevant to an early puberty patient. TLDR, yes, but you’re listening, so… 

My asexuality was constant and unchanged across many years, and across several different antidepressants (variously Wellbutrin alone, or wellbutrin plus one other), and across several different approaches to therapy. About halfway through a decade of depression treatment, my asexuality was the least transient aspect of my “diagnostic criteria”. My sense of rightness and comfort with asexuality was genuine and enduring. And based on this consistency, and my lack of discomfort, I convinced my primary, psychiatrist, and therapist that if (big if) asexuality was an aspect of my depression, it was my lowest priority to treat. I became an asexual person with depression, rather than a depressed person exhibiting low libido. 

My baseline T was very low for male aged 40, about 230. Wondered if this was “a sign” I could be MTF trans, and privately worked very hard to find an answer = yes. But no, trying to be feminine felt differently wrong than my baseline, but did not feel objectively better. Worked with an endocrinologist and boosted my T to the typical male mid 600s for two months, and holy hell I felt awful, and was awful to be around. Abandoned that treatment. 

Now, just in the last 18 months, on the heels of the testosterone experiment, I figured out why all the standard depression treatments for a middle-aged male didn’t resolve my depression. Because I’m gender queer. “Failing“ male/masculine personal expectations and treatment goals was causing most of my depression. After my MTF exploration, it me a LONG time to arrive in the right context to have the realization that non-binary is a totally valid way to be a good person. And a decade-tall heap of depression and internalized shame simply evaporated. Almost instantly, felt tons better and mostly non-Depressed. Worked with psychiatrist to taper off of all antidepressants, and felt slightly better! 8 months ago started low-dose HRT with a gender therapist, aiming to demasculinize but not feminize. Started minimal elements of social, physical, and medical transition, aiming for non-binary androgyny. Siterone 12mg/d & E2 Suppressed my T to about 20 (Serum E is about 30) and the constant mental noise of gender dysphoria mostly disappeared!. Since I can think so much more clearly, I feel like I have my mind back, my depression is basically gone, and I feel better than I have felt in more than a decade!  

I spoke with my doctor and therapists extensively about my sexuality = asexual. I do not ever recall my doctors or therapists interrogating my gender identity. Maybe they helped indirectly but I feel like I did all the legwork figuring out that trying to be a non depressed male/masculine person was making me feel like shit. 
But that’s all water under the bridge. I can think clearly again and I don’t feel depressed! Incidentally, this “better than I felt in years” business has so far endured for 18 straight months!
>so many cishet providers assume their sexual experience is universal

Yes. This. 

So many people. Assume their experience. Is universal. In my experience. (periods are gentle claps)
One solution would be to make all bathrooms gender neutral, in particular if each one is a single toilet bathroom—that is a question of mere signage.
That's okay. As a binary person, it is often hard to even see the ways we as society have gendered our day-to-day life.

If your bathrooms aren't single stall and you only have two facilities, a simple change could be new signs: from ""male"" / ""female"" to ""with urinals"" / ""without urinals"". Or a notice that patients are welcome to use any bathroom they feel best aligns with their gender.

Thank you for your efforts!
Enjoy the video. I’m sure with your viewpoint you are an excellent physician, and you will always have patients. Thank you for treating people who need help with no strings attached. You are a true doctor. I have the utmost respect for doctors such as yourself.
I’ve since adjusted to referring to them with formal anatomical terms, which personally I would advise defaulting to. Definitely not “lady parts”!
Pretty much the whole shebang- a lot of my symptoms are comorbid or caused by more than one illness, so I'm not really sure which was caused by what- but I have lightheadedness, fainting, dizziness, brain fog, fatigue, headaches, palpitations, tremors, shakiness, all of the heartrate symptoms of pots, as well as quite a few symptoms more commonly caused by EDS, like joint hypermobility, dislocations and sublaxations, chronic pain, etc. Unfortunately, both are diagnoses of exclusion, so ""last resort"" is quite accurate. After convincing my GP that my symptoms weren't due to my implant, I was basically told that if it wasn't caused by that then it was all in my head. Luckily my mother's a nurse and since we live in a very rural area she knew my doctor professionally so they took her word for it that I wasn't faking my symptoms and I was referred to another specialist. Rinse and repeat. Finally, I got a doctor who just didn't know I was nonbinary and- lo and behold- I got both diagnoses in one visit.
Thank you for sharing your journey. I think that grudge is a completely reasonable response to people making you think you had to fit into a box, that you definitely didn't fit into.
Just thought you’d like to know:

Last summer, my now ex-wife tried to shame me out of being who I am, despite claiming to be an ally. 2 nights ago, my current partner asked to do my makeup for me for my first time ever, and they were able to make me see someone in the mirror that made sense to me. Good morning 🖤	I can’t wait to let them do this again when we have more supplies. They completely understand me when I say that I’ve never felt like myself until the moment I looked in the mirror when we were done. I’m still trying to understand truly what my identity is, though presently I identify as gender fluid/non-binary. Sorry to gush, but it’s just been a very…positive feeling week for me, and it really all traces back to this. 🖤	"Yay
So happy you have this support now. You deserve it 💜
I’m so happy you got away from her. You look amazing 💛💛💛
Fly free butterfly. Free.
aWW! I'm glad you're happier than ever, you deserve it :)

I'm cis f and I have a nb partner and I did the same for them it was so sweet to see their face light up when i showed them their finished makeup look! we sometimes paint our nails to match too x)

I hope u both have more sweet experiences like this in ur future <3
Wow! There's so much emotion going on in your eyes 😭 it looks like you feel so RIGHT, it's like you're seeing yourself for the first time. But at the same time you seem to be grieving a little bit that past you wasn't able to feel like that 🥺 

Not only have you gotten yourself out of an abusive situation (very difficult to do, congrats) but you've also found support as you learn to experience existence as the person you now understand yourself to be. 🥰 I think it will be a fun journey to discover more of who you really are and what you like :)

Also just my two cents but you seriously resemble Jennifer Aniston in that first pic for some reason
Thank you, star stranger 🥺 admittedly, I always look a lil emo 🥺 but I did feel like I saw myself for the first time. I stared in the mirror for so long, and I just felt whole, which has been a very rare feeling for me in life. My marriage ended in a nightmare, and it’s one I still have sometimes at night. My ex wife claimed to love me exactly as I am, then used my identity to get her family members to attack and shame me after she decided to have an affair and ask for a divorce. I still feel their words like knives, even though I couldn’t care less about them. My current partner is the most loving and supportive person I could have asked the universe to let me meet, and has always reassured me that they love me for me, not my identity. They assure me daily that no matter who I may turn out to be, it will not change the love they feel for the person they continue to choose 🥺. I hope you have a beautiful weekend 🖤
That's one of the loveliest things I've been called, thank you ☺️🥰

gender expression does not equal gender identity. Share with someone who is gender nonconforming 🥰		"Which both me and my friend both knew this

Edit: *wish. I wish I knew this
Much love because the message is simple and is totally how everyone should view gender and gender expression. I love it and support this message with all my heart. From one non-binary person to, what I am assuming is, another non-binary person (based purely on the sub you are posting on).

Edit: Feel free to correct me if I am wrong in my assumption.
took me a hot second to figure out what could possibly gender non conforming about this video lol
It's true and you should say it. Love the style btw
Nice 😉
😅 I'm actually trans female now 

But I still feel I spent many years thinking I was agender so I feel very close to Non-binary peeps and I try to support them in everything I do.

 As for the reason I posted it here. I just thought that it was a message Some non binary people would like to hear 🥰
😂🤣 but you got there. Most people can't even get that far 🙄
Ty much 🥰
Sorry. I meant I WISH me and my friend both knew this. Typo
Oh, okay. You are a non-conforming transwoman then. Cool. Sorry for assuming. I am non-binary, as I said. I am also transfem. I like the message because it validates my current situation.
Oh damn 😳 I'm sorry friend 😔

I’ve been questioning my gender identity a lot recently. Do you think I look outside the gender binary or just a cis girl dressing up? (15 afab)		"Anyone can be nonbinary!!
I’m also considering changing my name to Aster (I’d want to change my name anyway even if I wasn’t questioning my gender). Do you think it’s a gender neutral name/fits me?
There is no way for anyone of any gender to look. Someone who looks like you could be a girl, nonbinary or a guy - there's no way to tell! Just do what makes you happy.
You look very fashionable. When I look to see alignment with gender binary irl, the eyes and regard for others is often crucial. Cis people expect to be rewarded for fitting the mold, it’s usually a more passive self awareness, as if they were dreaming. Non-binary people are awake, alert.

Afab with any curves and you meet a lot of sexism in fashion, few manufacturers try to hide curves in women’s fashion, while most amab fashion tries to emphasize chest. The sweaters help, with a crisp white collar. Hope you are avoiding dysphoria and binding.

Sometimes you don’t want the burqa just to avoid perception. You want to celebrate joy with accessories. The Oscar Wilde dandy vibe is a solid one.
These pics read as andro>fem as you scroll, the final 2 being mostly fem but could be read as andro if you wanted. The first 3 are super androgynous though imo! Love the yellow sweater especially :)

Edit: but as another comment said, you can dress any way and be nb!!!
You look like you could be any gender and are just VERY stylish
this is a robbery, hand over the gender.
If I saw you in school if think you were a lil bit enby ☺️👍
The first one especially gives me a kind of ascended andro professor vibe, very well done. Plus a lot of androgynous looks have a central element of a tucked shirt + structured clothing. You’re definitely on to a thread that will hopefully be a joy to follow!

the bathroom thing happened to me today	I'm a senior in high school and today, as I was going to the bathroom, a freshman girl shouted at me to leave thinking I was a guy. For some context this year they put in a rule that states everyone must use the bathroom of their AGAB, despite gender identity. I usually always go for the women's bathroom vs the men's because its cleaner, so it's what I've been using since I came out as nby. The thing is though, I'm AFAB. I don't want to scare people in the bathrooms but I also would like to pee in peace. Ugh.	"I'm not saying you should do this, but I'd ask that hateful student if she needs to see my genitals in order to leave me alone. What an asshole.
USA?
Are there any less used bathrooms or private ones (like in a nurses office)?  If not it might be worth it to speak to a school counselor or general authority figure about which bathroom you’re using and make sure you have it on record.
This is the curse of more gender non conforming presentations. I don't really have ""bathroom use"" dysphoria but it's still stressful when I'm presenting more androdous. 

I have to do the debate, do I look afab? Amab? If Im going to the men's I'll probably be read as obviously trans (or super gay) which will draw hate, but the woman's I'll be read as trans (more hate) or.... Super gay.
I had that happen in public. An old woman seemed scared cus I'm quite a bit larger than she was . She asked multiple times if she was in the right restroom
I'm so sorry that happened to you :( 
I got damn hate peeing out in public/work. I don't think people understand how stressful it can be for us! 💕
I am sorry you are in this situation and that the whole legal thing is so complicated there.

I used to have this too, but of course it was a less loaded context I guess... I'm also afab and my voice is quite high. Without giving any explanations I would just talk back saying something like ""what?"" Or ""what do you mean?"" and people would feel super ashamed and confused. Honestly, I don't care about bigots or what they think of me or my gender, but I'm obviously quite old now and things are easier for me as a whole. 

Is there anyone safe in your school you can talk to?
I got so flustered in the moment I just said ""I'm nonbinary"" and went into a stall anyways. What I would have done to go back in time and tell her to mind her business
I’d do this too.  “Oh my god, I can’t believe you just asked to see my vagina, what the hell?!”  

If they want to try and embarrass me and be ridiculously offensive, I will be even more embarrassing and ridiculously offensive in turn.  

“God, what kind of pervert just asks to see someone else’s genitals in the bathroom?! What kind of predator are you?! I just wanted to pee in peace, the fuck lady!!!”
Yep. And a southern state too.
God I feel this, I don't give a fuck which bathroom I use. I only care for my own safety!! I've been given weird looks and asked if I'm in the right bathroom no matter which I used. 

One time I had a lady come in AS I WAS PEEING and she started going off about how this is the womens bathroom blah blah blah and I said something to the effect of ""would you like to see my fucking vag? I know what the sign on the goddamn door says"" when I was done I found her and yelled at her in front of all her co-workers about how she should leave people the fuck alone (she was a worker at the place). I have so many stories like this it's not even funny.
Yeah we all go through that. After the fact we all come up with super clever things we could have said during a confrontation. You'll get better at it, but I think you handled it wonderfully. 

You'll go on to live a fulfilling life and your schoolmate will be a sour, hateful person who resents everyone without realizing she's the problem.
are you at a private school or a public school?
That response was such a power move
public. I believe it's a district wide rule or something stupid
that’s really scary and i’m so sorry! it also might not be legal. have you asked your school to provide you with an alternate gender neutral bathroom? (if that’s what you want). your school/district could be at risk of losing funding as it’s violating title IX laws. wishing you the best op, hang in there 🙌

Reminder that all trans identities are valid and oppressing enbies will not make bigots treat binary trans folks any less worse	I'm tired of members within the trans community wanting to decide who gets to be trans and who doesn't. It's giving gatekeeping and transphobia. Not everybody wants to or has the privilege to pass. Not everyone has the access, support, ability, and/or resources to medically transition. None of that should mean that someone is any more or less valid. We're all facing a common enemy and that enemy is definitely not our own siblings.

"I'm tired of hearing ""they're just old fashioned"""	"Exactly what the title says, I'm tired of being mocked and belittled by people, just to have the people close to me excuse their behavior.  Tolerance isn't something new by any stretch of the imagination, people have always been capable of empathy and understanding.  ""They're just old fashioned"" and ""it's how they were brought up"" or even ""that's just how the world is"" cut so deep when it's from the people who are supposed to support me, and help validate my identity.  Does anyone else constantly have to hear these types of excuses?"	"In like 2009 I asked my grandma (born in 1930) what she thought of gay marriage. She thought for a moment, then said “my gut reaction is that a child should have a mother and a father. But I know that isn’t true, because some people only have one parent, and some couples never have children. So I know my first reaction is wrong. All that matters is that they love each other and their children.” 

THAT’S how old fashioned works. You challenge your own beliefs because you’re a thinking feeling human. There’s no excuse for being an asshole. 

(And it turns out my little cousin is gay and my grandma loves him and his boyfriend 🥰)
I think that’s one of the most selfish excuses as well. They want you to adapt for them but they won’t adapt for you.
Sadly yup. As if being intolerant was the cultural norm before
It’s absolute bullshit and you’re right to be sick of it. It’s infantilizing and dehumanizing to older folks to outright assume that they can’t understand the modern world. 

Furthermore, it proves and shows that these older folks lived through so much social change and learned fucking nothing and don’t deserve to be coddled. 

I hate that excuse, as well, OP.
they're not captain amarica they've not been on ice for the last 60 years they've been here the whole time they should know how to act by now
 I've worked in memory care and the psychiatric field for multiple years now, especially with older individuals. I've also had both a man in his 50s-60s last week be pretty casually affirming (telling me that I'm the man for something before adding ""or the woman, if you'd like"") and I had an even OLDER man a couple years back ask me just as offhandedly if I have a girlfriend or boyfriend while making conversation. Being old =/= being conservative.
The worst thing about that excuse is that the world isn’t even “old fashioned” anymore
Yes. Same here. Thank you. 💜
Yep. Actually just had an entire family blowout due to my identity as non-binary and my in-laws refusal to ‘believe in it’ due to their ‘old fashioned’ excuse.

What’s most important for you, is knowing your personal boundaries and expectations. If you clearly articulate these to the people who are “supposed” to support you, and they blatantly refuse because of X reason, do not continue making space for them in your life. 

They clearly are not making space for you and it is not your responsibility to carry them along attempting to teach while also trying to live your authentic life.
Everytime I hear that I wanna respond ""No they're a child who won't take their head out of their ass for two seconds to see that what they're doing is immature and harmful. They need to grow the fuck up,"" but instead I just say ""yeah no sure that makes sense."" It most certainly does not. :(
Completely right. If you were brought up as an asshole, it's on you to acknowledge and change that, no matter your age. I especially hate ""don't even mention LGBT+ stuff around them, or you will upset them"" - oh right, then maybe they need some upsetting to finally think about their phobias.

I had some lovely old people as neighbors for the last years. One lady in her 80s who had slight dementia and a severe case of christianity always wished god's blessings on my husband and me. I don't think she fully understood why one of the two young men was wearing a skirt sometimes, but she was always friendly and polite. She didn't care about sexuality  or gender, but she did care about people being friendly and that we were. 

And then there was this old couple in their 70s who first met me as mostly masc presenting, and were really talkative, as old people are. Of course they asked if I had a girlfriend and I truthfully answered ""No, a husband actually"" and without missing a beat, they asked where he was from, what hes was doing, etc. A little nosy, but not the tiniest bit homophobic. And when I first started presenting more femme, the wife didn't even flinch, but complimented me on my fashion sense right away and even asked me what kind of lipstick I prefer. Later I explained to them that I'm nonbinary and again they were completely fine with it. Not even the ""Oh, I got a grand-nephew who's gay, you know ..."", but just like it's the most normal thing in the world. Unbelievably good humans, both of them.
I mean I'd say it was, but following an old ""cultural norm"" means they're inflexible and don't understand that human conceptions of the world change, usually in a ""well I'm not changing so you have to"" way that is equivalent to putting them above the rest of society and the cultural norms of today

So in essence I agree with your point, just my view of cultural norms over time"	zq1kpg	NonBinary	121	0.99	2022-12-19 19:49:41

MY TOP SURGERY IS APPROVED!!!!!!!	"Hi all,

I've been posting about my journey pursuing top surgery on a few different subs (transurgery, genderqueer, and here: https://old.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/8hqb3c/update_insurance_decision_on_top_surgery/

I called the pre-certification line today as I hadn't heard anything and they usually make a decision pretty fast on whether or not they will approve something.  Low and behold, **they told me it was approved!!!!** They'll most likely call the surgery office next week asking for a date in which they will contact me and we'll proceed forward from there.

I am so happy as I didn't even know this would be a possibility. I want others to know that if you do your research, fully advocate for yourself and remain patient, good things will happen!

I also want to fully emphasize that for some individuals and their current situation, trans-related healthcare and/or procedures are not available or supported. I want you to know that you are not forgotten and that your identity is still valid regardless of how much you ""pass.""

To everyone else pursuing surgery, getting surgery or are already post-op, keep living your authentic life and sharing your experience. It's been too long since I've allowed my own authenticity to show!"	"So so excited for you! :)

Hey there, I'm struggling to find my identity and looking for a gender neutral name. Any suggestions?		"Lilac
Ahhh I thought of another purple flower that would be a great name!! Iris! It sounds very gender neutral to me.
Any interest in color-themed names?
Some names that I feel fit you: Jamie, Adrian, Mick (or Mack), Sparrow, Orion, Rivers, Jules (or Jewels), Emerson (Ralph Waldo Emerson is my favorite author),  Delta. 

Some purple-themed names: Iris, Wisteria, Royal, Orchid, Amethyst

By the way - love the nails. Beautiful shape & color!
Violet would be a very cute name.
Aster is a great name for a purple flower!! There’s also Indigo, Nepeta, Salvia, and Calla. That’s all the purple flower names I’ve got. 

Edit: Zinnia, Holly, Lupine,  and Datura. (maybe not that one though since it’s also a drug) Some red ones are Chrysanthemum (possibly Chrys for short), Amaryllis, Poppy, Penta(s), Verbena, and Cosmos. A few pink too for good measure: Begonia, Alcea, Hyacinth (cool LGBT history behind that one too), Lotus, and Lycoris.
Violet? Valentine? Val?  you give me the vibes of someone with a V starting name :)
Rain? Or rayne? It’s what I thought of immediately when I saw you
I like the name Ezio, Though it is generally a male name, It just sounds amazing
Omg that's so cute I love it
Yes please! 
Anything in the red/purple spectrum would be amazing
I've actually gone by violet for sometime hahaha but it's seem as a feminine name in my country and I've been looking for something more neutral right now
Still cute tho
I've actually gone by violet for sometime hahaha but it's seem as a feminine name in my country and I've been looking for something more neutral right now
thanks for the V thing btw, I'll think more about it
💜💜💜
I got, ""Mauve,"" vibes from you. Idunno, that was the first word that came to mind.
Some colors that might make good names would be Sienna, Umber (more brown than red but still could be cool), Peri (periwinkle), Indigo. There's also some names like Flynn (Gaelic for red), Phoenix (Greek origins for reddish/purple), there's a lot of very unique ideas out there!
Yes, indeed, Violet is very cute.  My other suggestion, that first came to mind, albeit not color themed is ""Terry"" or ""Jamie"".  Both names are very gender neutral.
Flynn is really pretty, I like it"	mtwfkv	NonBinary	119	1.0	2021-04-19 08:52:11
Friendly reminder for all the lovely peeps here:	You dont owe anyone ANY amount of femininity, masculine, or neutrality! Gender is a spectrum! Your indentity is YOUR identity, no one else's. You dont have to explain it.	"Thank you for the reminder. My logical brain knows this, but it's always at war with my emotional side, which tends to be stronger. But reinforcement of that is reaffirming. ,🥰🥰🥰
Very true. I sometimes feel like I don't fit in non-binary spaces because I'm not androgyne, don't use they/them, and I'm only minimally GNC.
I struggle to not start using they/them even though playing d&d characters who are NB feels 'right'... outwardly I can't pass for anything other than female (huge chest) and I feel like I'm a fraud...
I definitely needed to see this. sometimes I feel like I wont be accepted cause im too fem presenting
pronouns =/= gender. i know a cis woman who prefers he/him and many cis queer guys in the drag scene use she/her and he/him
i know you know this already but sometimes you need someone else to remind you that you are valid 💜
you can always try asking your closest friends to try out new pronouns for you and see how you like it 🥰 boobs are unrelated to gender for me but i can certainly commiserate over having “traditionally feminine” features. hugs!!
Fems can be thems! How you present doesn't matter, how you feel does!
Oh, I know! I identify as 'me' generally. But taking that step into changing pronouns at work and maybe changing my name is... intimidating...
Oh ok 😄 I'd say just go for it! It certainly is intimidating, but once I did it I've felt the best I ever have in my life! Highly recommend!"	yese85	NonBinary	118	1.0	2022-10-27 13:46:01
Hey all! I'm trying to feel more confident with my identity as a non binary person, just wondering what names pop into your head when you see me? Could be objects/animals or actual names (they/them)		"jasper, silas, dorian, basil, jesse, cairo, jean : )
Hayden and Sparrow. Cause you kind of give me Jack Sparrow vibes.
aster
fern or thorne
Your third pic feels like an invitation to dance, I miss dance



I wish I had half of your style
Claire, Jack,... the hyperactive character who ends up living an impossible love and then gets depression and let himself dies at The Hundred (sorry his name slipped away)


Hmmm... Theo,... Tea?
not sure why but i immediately thought of cosmo
I'm getting el names really - Elle, ellouise, Elantris, those sorts of names.
Seb/Zeb or Arkos
Leaf, Clover, Basil, Willow... something about your appearance reminds me of plants in a good way
emil/emile ? it’s masc
Your hair reminds me of an enby person on TikTok named Col.
Henri

I know it’s typically masculine but that side has potential to be completely ignored.   I believe that the name Henri has full potential for a non-binary persons name.
Bird/Byrd :D
My brain said raven then crow
Sam, rain, cloud, Reed, charlie
Oh you look majestic. Hmm, Ace, River, Dorian, or Jade?
I'm getting Phoenix vibes, Nix for short
I think you are a dune
Fabian/ Fabianne or Florian
Aspen
Juniper
I feel like you would be a bug. Like the coolest bug name or a moth name. Bee would fit you I think (:
Ooo or beetlejuice!!!
Idk why but rain/rayn popped into my head
Jos, Judas, Kris, idk the first person that popped into my head when I saw you was callmekris
Cypress
Dylan
Alex/Alec, Waryn, oh! Maybe Jasper or Juniper, Jalo… I think a J one would be good
Raven came to mind
alex
Kellan
Willow, Basil, or Formaldehyde (tho this one might be a bit intense honestly)
Fawn
Funny you say Dorian and Basil, in the middle of reading the Picture of Dorian Gray ahaha, really good picks thank you!!
I was about to say jasper too! :)
Come dance with me then!! Open invite to all!

And that's really sweet thank you :) my secret is the thrift shops and secondhand stores (;
Funnily enough, Jack seemed to spark a little something when I said it to myself in the mirror... I think we're on the right track haha
Just saw Jasper in the other comment

That was the name of the character
I reckon the green and pink lighting gives major Fairly Odd Parenrs vibes keke
Elantris is intriguing... might look at some similar sounding names
Nix was one of my screen names growing up, I'll definitely consider this one
Elaborate?
Was kind of waiting for some bug names, Bee is kinda cute, but I reckon a moth name would feel more suitable
The J names are having a strong pull, Wayne is pretty cool too :D
i’m actually in the middle of reading it, too! thats what made me think of the names : )

Sorry for the selfie. Found a love for makeup and heels to express my feminine side and still rock my amab body. Fairly new to my identity and overall so much happier in my newfound gender expression!		"You don't have to apologise! Your joy is our joy!
you look amazing! i love your makeup and your necklace
What you just said really relates to me. I just really feel more confident in my identity now that I identify as non-binary. I’m new to it too. I just really feel happy in my gender expression. :)
Is that a UCF shirt? Yaaass go knights!
Thank you so much! <3 I’ve been truly inspired by this community when I see all of the love and support for others.
Thank you so much! Learning about the whole new world of makeup is no doubt a challenge, but just enough practice and mistakes and I can get where I want to be! There’s still a lot to learn and I’m slowly adding to my collection and my skillset.
That’s amazing that you’re feeling that same euphoric feeling :) it’s amazing how liberating it can be when you break out of the gender binary and screw the gender norms!
Charge On!!!
True it is so euphoric to just be yourself and not worry but be confident. 🤗"	fitrju	NonBinary	119	1.0	2020-03-15 01:49:15
Been slowly getting better at my eye makeup and wearing it out in public even when I’m not intending to be my total female identity and it makes me feel so happy and true to myself🥰😌		"Omg, you look so good. You did an excellent job. Wish I could do my makeup that well
Love your eye makeup and accessories! 😍✨
i only started a couple months ago! 🤍
Good job, definitely keep it going! ❤"	neqi8a	NonBinary	114	1.0	2021-05-17 20:11:21
CLOSED MINDED PEOPLE SUCK AAAHHHH	Do people not understand what a spectrum is? Like seriously, the fact that some people can't comprehend that there are more than two genders and one sexuality is MIND BLOWING. I think sexuality at least is more understood now, but people are so far from grasping gender identity. Gender is unique to every person, even if you take two people who both identity the same, they could express it differently internally or externally. ITS CALLED A SPECTRUM!! People who are homophobic or transphobic are so frustrating... like why do you even care?? It's really not that crazy of a thing, for one person to be different from others? And that makes you angry? Or makes you feel the need to have a fucking debate over it? Give me a break.	"Ive tried ignoring them, but sometimes you just cant live like idiots dont exist lol you just want to scream 😩😫💨💨 AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!
I feel it. I've gotten. A lot better about not caring so much. I now viciously just defend myself and my community because I know No one else will.. yet. It's like this in the disabled community too albeit not ""as"" bad but still quite bad if you're not disabled ""enough"" or if you have a invisible disability. Luckily for me I'm a disabled trans person so woo hoo double whammy. But God forbid I complain in anyway at all whatsoever because then I'm ""playing the victim card"". Lol its laughable really so I chose to laugh in their face and at them instead of trying to cha ge minds. Someone else who's stronger and more patient than I can do that. I'm far too tired to fight like that anymore.
The vast majority of people *in this community* don't even know what a spectrum is. They confuse a gradient with a spectrum
Ugh, ikr?
I agree
they j target us to stay in power and the mindless sheep follow lol


I feel you dude.  These people only want control over people they don't like or understand. I promise you they aren't REALLY interested in the mental health of children, or the high suicide rate, or the fact gender dysphoria is a ""mental illness"" or the fact that it's hard to detransition. They don't care about ""protecting children"" or the wellbeing of trans folks. Any republican or person who says that is lying through their teeth. They will relentlessly bend over backwards and jump through these insane hoops in an attempt to sound and feel superior. ""But what about the high suicide rate? Gender dysphoria is a real mental illness that needs to be addressed and..."" They. Don't. Care. If they did, they would be all for gender affirming care and support for trans people. They bring up gender dysphpria, mental illness, and suicide rates in an attempt to dehumanize us. Suicide does not matter to them. It's not a real point in any discussion. They say it to make us sound unstable and inhuman. 

The most important thing to a republican is not change, is not progress, is not help. The most important thing to a republican is WINNING A DEBATE. winning a fucking ""debate."" A debate that takes place in a Reddit thread, in a YouTube comment, or on an Instagram post. They grin from ear to ear when they mindlessly regurgitate outdated  talking point or bring up flat out fake """"""statistics"""""" because they feel like they are winning a debate or ""owning the libs"" or some dumb, superficial shit.

Being a conservative is no longer being part of a political party. It's part of some dumb internet fanclub echochamber where you hate people you don't understand and claim to be critical thinking but just take any ""fact"" you find at face value and refuse to do research on any counterpoint or look at any actual statistics. A republican doesn't look at statistics to understand or learn about others. They do that so they have ammunition to dehumanize you in the next ""debate"" they mindlessly inject themself into, when the thing they injected themself into isn't even a ""debate,"" to begin with -- it's a fucking discussion on human rights.
Same, I’d defend myself and the lgbtq+ people especially online. Some of these bigots try to gaslight me and try to jump to other subjects. Ugh their mental gymnastics. You actually win if they change the subjects. They won’t admit they’re wrong so they try to say nonsenses to justify their bigotry. FFS.
Fr, when I stated facts about lgbtq+ people, those people tried to gaslight me and change the subjects to something that’s really unrelated. I hate their mental gymnastics. They won’t admit they’re wrong. They should realize they’re only a bigot.
What I imagine anytime I hear ""spectrum"" is like how in any game character customization thing there are tons of like lines with sliders, and you can put the slider anywhere on the line for any single line. For example, if there is an option for how tall you want your character to be, the far left end of would be the shortess and far right would be tallest, but you can slide the slider to any point on the line.That's how I view it at least; apologies for my very poor explanation skills. But at least I know I understand it, and as much as I wish everyone knew and understand what a spectrum was (especially in terms of sexuality, gender, mental disorders, etc.), I guess I should be lucky that I'm able to comprehend it no problem.
they never have a real response EVER lmao

when they start telling u to fuck off or start throwin bible verses

thts wen u know u got em good lolol
That's a gradient. Not a spectrum. A gradient is a slider between X and Y, for example, red and blue, with a variety of purples in the middle. A spectrum has red, blue, green, yellow, etc.
I should really limit how often I use the word ""like"" when explaining things...
If they tell bible verses I’d say “Preach me when you fully don’t have a sin, like 100% no sin at all”."	12jtjqn	NonBinary	118	0.98	2023-04-12 17:46:07
I'm out as nonbinary. But I'm not allowed to socially transition?	" I'm nonbinary transmasculine.  

I'm only out to my mom. But  I think she's pretending to be supportive? 

When I told her I'm nonbinary she seemed to be accepting of me and she seemed calm.

 I told her I will show her articles about nonbinary identities. She said she'll look it up herself. But I don't think she has.

 I asked her if I can wear men's clothing. She said"" no because you're not a man. You have a lot of cute girly clothes so why change it?"" 

I asked her if I get rid of or donate my old clothes that don't fit anymore. Can I get men's clothing?

She said no again.

She said she's still getting used to this. 
But she seems really angry at me all the time now.

She's also still calling me she/her, cute, pretty. I hate it so much! 

I'm feeling really depressed and frustrated and hurt. 

I hate womens clothes. I am really afraid of people seeing me as a woman. I hate it! 

What should I do? I don't know what to do. How can I make my mom understand me? 
Is there anything I can do to feel masculine? 
Because my mom is not letting me socially transition. 
I'm so angry."	"Just remember that you own your identity, and regardless of other people's response, you can be assured in your own perception of yourself.

Find small things that give you power, and if it's possible, find social spaces that you're comfortable being yourself within. 

Family can seem like the whole world, but there are many more people out there that will support you!
Depending on your situation, you could try switching out wardrobe pieces a little at a time such as buying plain t-shirts or flannels with your allowance. I hope your mom isn’t so draconian that she would prevent you from using your own money to buy pieces as you can afford to do so. Over time, she’ll get more used to the idea and you can continue to work on her a little at a time.
As someone in the closet I just slowly switched out my clothing. Slowly got out all the pinks and switched them out for blue and black( kept some things to not be suspicious) and started asking for men's shorts because I don't like them being so small and exposing me, and POCKETS. I've been getting more gender neutral stuff or just changing how I think about some clothes, if I saw the same flannel on a guy would I think it's a women's top, no.
It sounds like your mom isn’t even pretending to be supportive. I’m very sorry this is something you’re going through. 

I’m going to read between the lines and assume you are still fairly young/living at home/financially dependent on your parent(s). This may be something you have to endure for a while. 

Watching your precious child grow into their own individual can be hard for parents in even the most granola home environments. Some mothers place a lot of their own identity into their daughters. It isn’t fair, but it’s a thing. This can be challenging for her. She’s known you her whole life as one way. She may be hoping this is just a phase. 

Perhaps try talking to your mom and let her know how you feel. Avoid statements that sound like accusations, but be clear, honest and start setting boundaries. 

Or you can always do the punk rock thing and burn all your “cute girly” clothes.
Lots of good ideas on direct approaches in other comments that would be ideal,  so I'll provide some passive ones in the event that pushing back big with your mom puts you in danger:

I'd take a mile when she gives you an inch. So if she's okay with you donating clothes that don't fit, include some clothes that no longer fit your identity. There may also be options in your current wardrobe that would style well with a flannel or ball cap you keep in your locker (assuming you are in school). Do you have a solid amount of basics? Black and white t-shirts + jeans, beanies, hoodies could be easy to find and style in a more manly way in the immediate future.

You may be able to take her along baby steps in how you ask for clothing from ""men's"" to a ""different style."" There are plenty of she/her people out there that dress in a more manly way that she may be more receptive to. Would she be open to you dressing in more streetwear styles that accommodate gender bending? They are not perfect replacements for shopping in the men's section and I'm sorry you're not able to do that at the present.

I'm really hoping she's not so controlling to question / veto your donations or your decisions for what you've decided to wear from the clothes you have. And I'm hoping she comes around to letting you shop in the men's section, knowing full well that it's affirming for you.

Start to take on the responsibility of laundering your clothes if you don't already. 

Also save money and hide it from her. She may not support you in other ways down the line and use her privilege as an adult to prevent you from living your life to the fullest.
From what I can gather from the post, I'm going to assume you are on the younger side and still need your mom for things like getting new clothes, housing and food. If it wasn't the case, I don't think this would really be an issue as you'd be able to get new clothes on your own.

Your identity is valid, even if your mom is struggling with it. She might need some time to get used to it, especially if she has never met anyone non-binary or heard of it before. Give her some space and see how she evolves over time.

While I really do not wish this, and I really hope she is just shocked by the news and will come around, we don't live in a perfect world and not everyone is open to trans/non-binary people. I would strongly suggest to look into transphobic rhetoric and be aware of if your mom is using those techniques/vocabulary. I might be very pessimistic, but you still need to keep yourself safe. A lot of searches for parents looking into their kids being trans first fall on transphobic support groups.

If I'm wrong, and I hope I am, then you might be able to get to a middle ground with her. There are women's clothes that are more gender neutral. While it is not perfect, it might be good to slowly transition by gradually going more masculine, instead of jumping in head first. It'll probably be less jarring for her too. There's this weird taboo about buying men's clothes that is much easier to ignore when done gradually. If you can save money, do so, and get yourself men's clothes. You can also pick up pieces of clothes and show as as clothing, while avoiding mentioning if they are labeled as men's or women's. Hoodies are a personal favorite, as they hide the body and are gender neutral.

If you can buy clothes online, there is a lot of gender neutral clothes that could be labeled in a way that would be more palatable to your mom. In the end, you'd still be closer to being perceived as masculine, but there wouldn't be the label 'Men' on the clothes that could make your mom freak out.

If I can be mistaken for a men multiple times just because my hair is very short, I'm sure you can socially transition in a less than ideal situation.
Are you able to get a job? I would look into starting to be financially independent so you can have money to replace your wardrobe yourself since it doesn't seem like your mom is going to be supportive.  Or save any money given to you. 

I would start instilling boundaries such as her not buying you clothes for holidays if you guys do that. 

I'm sorry your going through this. Family not being supportive is the worst. But you will find people who like you as you are & are supportive of you. Keep doing you! From a fellow enby transmasc who is also struggling with family.

To feel masculine, I suggest getting dark colored shirts & look into KT tape or binders if you can get your hands on one. Pay attention to how men walk, stend, etc. I take inspiration from pinterest & have a secret board where I can figure out my style. Cut your hair short if you want to - I felt so euphoric when I did!
I've been through this myself and was a big reason why i was verbally and emotionally abused because I hated wearing girly clothes. I initially thought it was because I'm into gothic attire but wearing anything girly just causes me major discomfort. I was forced to wear stuff I didn't like and was told to get more girly things. I say depending on your age or even if you have your own money,just get the stuff you want to wear anyway. I kinda hide things from my mom now because she lost the ability to see her child for what they really are. I still wear things i like but I tone it down around her to the point she thought I changed. She doesn't seem like she accepts you,why not just wear what you want to? I'm sorry if this is coming off kinda bad,I've been through this myself like i said and it's taken me a long time to realize that I'm ok as the way i am. I hope it takes you less time than I did to realize that your life is more important than trying to please a parent. It's hard but I had to come to terms that my mom will never really accept me
I don't know if you are a sewer, but can you change the clothes you have? Try and redesign them to suit your style? Sending mom hugs. I'm sorry this happened.
I had a similar issue with my girlfriend. I let this happen for a while and every now and then i remembered her how i feel and we talked about that.

Basically, she need some time to fully grasp this and she's in a sort of mourning. You have to remind her you're still you, even when you're going to change something (like clothes) and that you're GOING TO do that.

If the time passes and she keep doing that...then just change. It's your choice.
I'm sorry you have to go through that. I'm going through a similar situation as yours, and all I can say for advice is that you should try changing little details by little details so she doesn't catch on, and to save some money to be able to buy your own stuff. Days will eventually get better, stay strong.
If you take up sewing, you can modify the clothes you have to look more masculine. I'm sorry that your mother isn't supportive, though, you deserve better.
How old are you? 

In a sense, you are better off than an amab NB person as it seems more socially acceptable for afab  people to go for a more tomboy look without necessarily outing themselves to the world.

At least while you aren't as free to dress how you feel when you feel, you might consider more gender neutral items.  Moving to body shorts to emulate more masc underwear, Ts and sweat shirts that are more neutral in color without anything that necessarily identifies you as female, etc.

There isn't  a silver bullet. I hope this helps. I hope you are free to express who you are sooner rather than later. 🤗
an easy solution is if you wanna buy men’s clothing, buy it. Then hide it. Honestly this isn’t something I would need to ask my parents. (I don’t)
Stop asking for men's clothing and say ""I wanna go get new clothing"" and just get men's clothing cheers
Thank you so much ❤️
Thank you 🙂
This is what I was going to ask. Why doesn't OP just ..Buy their own clothes?
I'll try talking to my mom. Thanks! 
Also destroying the clothes is a good idea lol😅
Thanks! I've been looking on Pinterest and I found some photos of women wearing like a streetwear style. (Oversized graphic tees, baggy jeans, Nike sneakers, Adidas sneakers) Do you know where I could find those clothes? Which stores?
Thanks! This helps. ❤️ Do you know where can I find gender neutral clothes online? Like which stores?
Thank you so much for the tips! And I'll start looking for a job. But I have really bad anxiety and I'm really shy.
Thanks 🙂❤️
I don't feel comfortable sharing my age. Thanks for your advice ❤️
>In a sense, you are better off than an amab NB person as it seems more socially acceptable for afab  people to go for a more tomboy look without necessarily outing themselves to the world.

AMAB here, even something as simple as piercing my ears and allowing myself to have long colorful hair took 34 years, right at the point where I have to worry about losing it 😭😭😭
You’re probably both joking, but in case you’re serious - please think carefully before going to extremes. Think carefully about the consequences your mom can enforce - like whether you’d be safe, if you did this (could she possibly get abusive, could she refuse to buy new clothes and you’d have to go without, could she punish you by restricting food/free time/etc). I don’t know how old you are, but depending on your mom/environment/home situation, I’d recommend either to keep communicating with your mom in a clear, healthy way (if you think that’s possible), or to sneak around (wear as masc clothes as your mom will accept without telling her it’s menswear, save up for eventually moving out or buying gender affirming items, etc)
You can also sell them and buy men's clothing with that money.
Look at men's streetwear / grunge too if those fit your style! For sneakers, I'd go to Nike / Adidas directly (they each also have techwear that's gender neutral) for oversized graphic tees / jeans I'd look at thrift stores / depop, or go to places like Hot Topic or even Target if you're looking for something specific in terms of fandoms. For jeans Levi's might do it for you, for cargo pants / graphic tees / jackets see also Pacsun, Vans (assuming you're in a younger demographic).

I hope these help! Thrifting is a good place to start at any income level. My favorite most manly tshirt that makes me feel so good is from a thrift store :)
Depends what you want to wear. I'd say big stores like wal-mart and target has clothes that are more neutral, but they might not be want you want. I mostly shop in alternative fashion stores, so unless you have my specific taste of black and satanic, it might not be the most useful recommendations.

From my own experience though, merch stores are usually gender neutral. Band shirts rarely care what gender you are.
I don't know your family situation, but when I was growing up, if I got a gift or something it wasn't really mine & could be taken away, unless I bought it. Hence why I suggested getting a job. If your anxiety is severe, I suggest talking to a doctor or, if you can afford one, a therapist. There's a ton of resources online with interview tips if you decide to look for a job.  Wishing you the best, hope this helps!
I respect that. Just wondering if you were a teen or able to get out on your own.
It is really fucked up that we can't wear whatever we choose.  High heels were invented for French noblemen, yet anyone masc presenting isn't supposed to wear them in our society. It makes no sense.
I think thats why alot of nb loved the emo /goth/Punk fasion as gender bender seems to be normal with tjis fssion trends,at least that was my experince growing up, ozher places other fasions so do notnmail me to it.
Okay I'll talk to her.
Thanks. This helps. :)
Oh okay
Could I have the store recs? I love black and satanic stuff <3
I don't see how saying amab people have it hard is particularly helpful to OP.

This isn't a competition and we are all having a non binary experience together.
Killstar, Foxblood, rogueandwolf, restyle, sockdreams are the ones I can think of right now
I was trying to make the point that it could be worse and they have options.  I was not trying to imply it was a competition.

I am sorry if you took it in a way it was not intended, and I don't mean that sarcastically. I am on the spectrum, and sometimes, my intent makes an impact that was unintentional.
i think it just feels odd here because even if its more acceptable for afab ppl to wear masc stuff OP is not being allowed to by their mom so it doesn’t apply to this situation. At this time OP isn’t any more able to dress how they want and are being forced into dysphoria inducing clothes
I wasn't thinking it would be all at once. More of  something to progress towards but I see your point.  ."	11jf2h1	NonBinary	116	1.0	2023-03-05 21:52:30
Non-binary, Muslim, and a little lost	"I'm non-binary and also Muslim.


I currently wear hijab and, though I actually don't believe it's religiously mandated even for binary women (and, regardless, believe very strongly in freedom of religion -- لاَ إِكْرَاهَ فِي الدِّينِ), it's something that feels intensely a part of who I am and that I don't want to give up. I often get dysphoric when I think about what this means regarding being treated as female and regarding being visibly Muslim in queer spaces.



I don't feel like I quite belong in queer spaces or Muslim spaces. It often feels like I am expected to *want* to give up and even denounce either being Muslim (in queer circles) or being non-binary (in Muslim circles). 


I'm already a pretty quiet person who doesn't particularly want to debate with people about my own identity, especially because I really do not want to accidentally hurt people who grew up in abusively religious families and, understandably, want to run as far away as they can from religion and never look back. 


So I mostly just take the casually Islamophobic and transphobic comments I hear in person and see online and direct them inward at myself. I'm trying to learn to be stronger, but I feel a little like I'm having to make myself up as I go along, honestly, like I'm going somewhere where there are no maps and I'm pretty lost.

&nbsp;

Can anyone of you lovely non-binary folks relate to the feeling of being trapped in a horrible liminal space between being non-binary and having another part of your identity that is seen as incompatible with that? 

&nbsp;

Edit from 2 month later: 

Apparently a handful of people have found this post through google searches -- and subsequently messaged me or commented. If you're Muslim and NB or binary trans (or questioning) and you've just found this post, my inbox is always open, no matter how long it's been since I posted this and, most importantly, *you are not alone.*"	"You belong! That's one of the things NBs struggle with all the time--feeling like we belong nowhere. Plus, both communities you belong to (Muslim and NB) have loud, judgmental gatekeepers who try to make you feel like you don't belong. You just have to know within yourself that they are wrong and that you'll find people within both groups who will come to accept you and your identity. Also, there are tons of AFAB NBs who wear feminine clothing. I don't see why a hijab should be treated any differently. 
There is a semi regular user here who is trans and Muslim too. Maybe you should talk to them. I will point them to this thread! 
Hi friend :) I can absolutely relate to your experience! I’m not Muslim, but I have a very good friend who is and he’s struggling with being Muslim and having an “incompatible” aspect of his identity that clashes with that. 

I understand how difficult it can be to not be accepted, but not quite rejected from either circle. It sucks and it makes me feel like an outcast. 

All I can say is, if you’re not out and it’s safe for you to come out and you’re ok with that, go for it. If it’s not safe, don’t. 
I can’t come out right now because my family aren’t very LGBT+ friendly, so I’m having I wait until I move out, which should be less than a years time, all being well. 

Embrace every aspect of your identity. If you want to wear hijab, keep doing that. Being non-binary can feel like we’re stuck in limbo all the time, not enough of something or too much of another... 

You are valid and you will definitely find people who accept you for who you are. I sincerely hope your family is supportive and if not, that you have a support network that do. I hope this helped just a little bit :) All the best friend!
Hi! I'm not Muslim, but I just wanted to jump in and say that you're absolutely valid and wearing a hijab doesn't make you any less so. I think it's horrible that people from both communities are trying to make you conform to what they want.

I wish I had some advice, but since I don't I just really wish you well and hope that you find some people irl who see and love both who you are and what you believe with no strings attached  💚💜💚💜
I can relate a little! I am nonbinary and a devout Mormon. It’s always assumed you can only be one or the other, right, either queer *or* religious. But we do exist, and our spiritual identities are just as valid and intrinsic and important :) I don’t have more specific advice for your situation, but I hear your struggle and you aren’t alone. You are Muslim enough *and* enby enough, no matter how you present. God bless you, my friend ❤️
>I'm trying to learn to be stronger, but I feel a little like I'm having to make myself up as I go along, honestly, like I'm going somewhere where there are no maps and I'm pretty lost.

This is such a poetic way of saying it. I relate to this very strongly. Just trying to navigate a world built around the gender binary, where traditions and norms don't even acknowledge us and balk at fitting us in as we are, not as they want us to be. (Likewise, I also totally hear you about not wanting to debate your identity--I've met a few people who think that who I am is something they can argue away.)

I'm so sorry you're running into so much Islamaphobia in queer spaces--that's not at all appropriate on their part. Places like that are meant to be inclusive and safe, that's the entire point.

I can totally relate to internalizing bigoted comments--in my case, it's mostly casually ableist things people have said or done because of my autism, severe ADHD, etc. For a very long time I couldn't even seek treatment because of the stigma associated. And likewise, to answer the question asked at the end of your post: I feel like I constantly have to compromise aspects of my identity in order to even exist in this world. To be acceptable socially I've had to minimize all the things that make me distinct, to repress my discomfort and behaviors so thoroughly that I don't even know *how* to be comfortable any more, to bite my tongue when misgendered, to just let it slide when people mock me for missing social cues or being anxious over what seems like nothing to them. That's just what I have to do to survive, and what kills me is it's never enough. 

I'm sorry if I got carried away there--I just realized I've never put any of that into words, so thank you for asking. I don't mean to erase your experience or say it's the same, but hopefully we have some common ground here. You're a wonderful, thoughtful person, and I'm glad you shared this (especially after facing difficulty in other queer spaces).
You are valid and if you ever want another nonbinary person to chat with my DM’s are always open
I’m not a Muslim so 100% correct me if I’m wrong, I’m fairly sure there are a lot of ways to wrap the hijab? Is there any way possibly styled more like a turban almost that would still feel authentic to you but present a bit more masculine?
I'm non-binary and Muslim! I don't have a whole lot to add, and I'm not part of much of a Muslim community these days, but I've definitely gotten some interesting reactions when people find out I hold both identities. I often feel a bit of pride when I surprise someone, but it's a lonely feeling too. Happy to chat if you like :)
I've once heard that angels don't have a gender and it is only when you are born that God assigns one. I don't know if it is true but it is a mindset that is dear to me because I struggled with a similar issue regarding God. There are many many traditions that say that God is beyond all opposites, and is something of pure unity, something that exists beyond this world because this world has such divisions. I am not saying Allah is not the Father, just that He is above all gender and loves you, no matter what gender you are.
Not Muslim, but non white and felt the need to look more into Islam at some point (probably as a way to find a non white community, between other things). Not sure how much it's relevant but I never got to really know that religion because I didn't feel safe doing so if I wanted to be out, and scared of judgement not only from my fellow queer people but also my mainly white social circle.
I've heard there was a Indonesian mosque that was mainly made by/for trans women, also a gay imam in Paris. There should be a Muslim queer community you could to talk to at least via email, maybe it's worth a try?
Also if you're interested, there is a great Muslim artist who's also a trans man wearing the veil, it's @ab_varaham on Twitter.
Good luck
I’m part of an lgbt Jewish Muslim solidarity discord, PM me and we can talk ♥️
I feel this. Living at multiple intersections is exhausting. It feels like a bunch of communities want parts of me, but nobody wants all of me. Even well-meaning people (and especially groups of people) struggle with identities that don't neatly conform to the community norm. And it's shitty   
 to be on the receiving end of that. It's hard, it hurts, and sometimes its scary. 

I haven't quite figured how to manage this either, or where to find the right space. I just wanted to  say that I can relate, and you're not imagining things. 
I hairwrap too! 
I’m a deeply spiritual person, though I’m confused about where exactly I belong or terms to use. 
It has been overwhelming trying to figure out a space to belong in and how to address the various -phobias. 
I’m running off to work soon but I can come back to this later to expand more or I’m happy to PM as well!
You know, you don't have to speak up to cut someone or something out of your life. If you don't feel comfortable saying something, that's fine...but you also don't have to suffer from it either. Your telling someone that they aren't acceptable can be as simple as never seeing them again or thanking them for inviting you, but declining anyway.  


It can be rough not fitting neatly into the boxes our social construct has for people. In many cases, particularly for those who refuse categorization (nonbinaries for example), it can mean that our options are more limited than others. However, if you consider that it means you'll only keep the most awesome and supportive of people around, I think it's worth it to go through some social pruning.  


You're amazing, you're worth it, and you were made as you are today, for whatever that means for your spirituality. :) <3
I know I'm late to the party, but I'm a nonbinary hijabi. I found this post on google while looking for more ""androgynous"" hijabi looks. This while thread is fantastic, I'm so happy to see others like me😊
Hey. I just wanted you to know that I found this post because I'm trying to develop my first video game, and one of the possible player characters I've designed and want to put in is an NB hijabi Muslim. I'm new to game development and currently trying to get through college, so I can't really promise that this project will come to anything, but if it does, I'll send you a link. You are valid and really brave!

P.S. I'm also looking for Muslim NB names for said character. If you know of any good ones, I'd love to hear them - it's been difficult to find good NB names that aren't really WASP-sounding.

Hello, I am not nonbinary nor Muslim but perhaps these 2 books could help somehow? They do not focus on being non binary specifically, though they do discuss the intersectionality of queerness and Islam. 

- We Have Always Been Here by Samra Habib. (Memoir. Talks about her experience as a Canadian queer Muslim.)

- Homosexuality in Islam by Scott Alan Kugle. (This one is much more academic but the helpful table of contents can direct you to specific arguments. It is arguing on the basis mostly of how homosexuality and Islam are not contradictory at all, looking at Islamic sourced - Koran and the such - through a modern lens. This isn't the resource for everyone but if you're looking for a queer friendly Muslim perspective, perhaps it can help.)

(Also, there are a few YouTube videos on being queer and Islam but I wouldn't suggest commenting on them...I got like 10 trolls after a harmless comment.) 

There's also a podcast called Crystal Queer hosted by a Muslim queer person. (He/they describe him/themself as masculine presenting with a genderless brain.)
I hear you on the gatekeepers of transness and being a ""good"" Muslim... (both real and the multitudes that seem to have metastasized in my own head).
Though I have also had a couple positive experiences, so that is something to hold on to.


I suppose a lot of the non-binary people I see online, and -- now that I think about it -- all the ones I know in real life, dress and generally present pretty androgynously. So I'm sure I've internalized that to some extent. And it doesn't help that were they to see a hijab-wearing AFAB person on the street, the last thing most people would think is non-binary, even if the rest of my clothes are pretty androgynous.

Thank you.
Ughh I am sorry about your family. 

I'm out to most of my friends. But I have an *extremely* large and close-knit family so (besides one cousin who I'm very close to and who has always kept my secrets just as I've kept his) I haven't told any of them because if I tell one person it will spread like wildfire and I'm not ready to deal with that yet, ya know? 
Thank you -- really, that's incredibly sweet of you to say and this kind of thing means a lot to me.
>It’s always assumed you can only be one or the other, right, either queer *or* religious.

I have to admit I know absolutely nothing about Mormonism (apologies!), but I feel this so hard.


Have you told any of your family, if you don't mind my asking? Is there at least some acceptance for being gender non-binary in your community?


>God bless you, my friend ❤️ 

جزاك الله خير

(basically, the same back to you!)




Well... your comment hit me unexpectedly hard. 


Thank you for writing it all out -- seriously. I might try to respond more in depth later, but without going into too much detail just now, I can relate some to the ableism and to the compromising who you are to get by until who you are is all mixed up.


I may just take you up on that sometime, thank you!
No sorry. That’s haram.
>I'm non-binary and Muslim! 

Just reading this, I let out a little ""Yessss!"" under my breath lol. I've honestly not talked to someone else who is, even online. 


How did your family / community take it, if you don't mind my asking (if you're out to them, that is)? Do you know of any good readings/sources on being non-binary and Muslim? I have so many other questions, but I don't want to bombard you with them all at once; can I PM you sometime?



>I don't have a whole lot to add, and I'm not part of much of a Muslim community these days, but I've definitely gotten some interesting reactions when people find out I hold both identities. I often feel a bit of pride when I surprise someone, but it's a lonely feeling too. Happy to chat if you like :)


I honestly hope I can get closer to feeling like this one day, inshallah. Though it does seem that much of the loneliness is inevitable.


Thank you for this. Really.
You've given me a lot to look up that I know little about regarding queer Muslims / Muslim communities. So, hey -- thank you.


 >Not Muslim, but non white and felt the need to look more into Islam at some point (probably as a way to find a non white community, between other things). Not sure how much it's relevant but I never got to really know that religion because I didn't feel safe doing so if I wanted to be out, and scared of judgement not only from my fellow queer people but also my mainly white social circle.


Yeah that implicit judgement / otherness that can come with being a Muslim (which, from what I've seen, often appears to be that much worse for converts) in queer, white, and academic circles is.... well, I get where you're coming from, I think. 



Honestly, I *do* sometimes struggle with having these little pangs of jealousy towards people who don't have to think of their own identities as inherently political. 

That sounds wonderful. I sent you a PM.
>I feel this. Living at multiple intersections is exhausting. It feels like a bunch of communities want parts of me, but nobody wants all of me. Even well-meaning people (and especially groups of people) struggle with identities that don't neatly conform to the community norm. And it's shitty   
> to be on the receiving end of that. It's hard, it hurts, and sometimes its scary. 


Yes, exactly. 

You put this feeling (or experience, or what have you) into words much better than I've ever managed to. 


And, yeah, it seems there aren't really *any* easy answers regarding existing in the liminal spaces between different identities and communities. Talking about it is helping me feel a bit less alone, at least today haha. So hey, that's something.


>I’m a deeply spiritual person, though I’m confused about where exactly I belong or terms to use. 
>It has been overwhelming trying to figure out a space to belong in and how to address the various -phobias. 

Cheers, I feel you on this, unfortunately. 


And, yeah, I'm obviously not the *most* orthodox Muslim (and actually really dislike it when people equate ""more orthodox"" with ""more devout""). Whatever labels, or lack thereof, define you, I would love to hear more of your thoughts. 
These are probably things I really have to work on (also the phrase ""social pruning"" is great and made me laugh).



Perhaps hiding who I am for so long as I had done (and still am doing for some people, family in particular) has made me more likely stick around people I know won't accept either my Muslim or my non-binary identities, since I knew I'd be burying down that part of me anyway. And with non-binary people, I honestly just feel lucky to know any, so I maybe don't have the best boundaries around them; I don't know.


Regardless, thank you for what you wrote.
Ayyyy :)


I hope you stick around! (and aren't as unfortunate as your usernamesake lol)

When I first realized I was non-binary, I was honestly afraid I was somehow the only one and there weren't *any* other nonbinary hijabis and I'm so happy to be wrong. 
Uhhhhh I'm pretty much swooning like a corseted Victorian just imagining a badass nb muslim playable character lol

Which is to say, *yes please*, and best of luck in developing your game, inshallah. 

> I can't really promise that this project will come to anything, but if it does, I'll send you a link. 

Stellar :)

Actually, if at some point you have any questions about the kind of ephemeral, make-it-up-as-you-go world of being a non-binary muslim, I'd try my best to help.

> P.S. I'm also looking for Muslim NB names for said character. If you know of any good ones, I'd love to hear them - it's been difficult to find good NB names that aren't really WASP-sounding. 

...

> really WASP-sounding

Ahhh I see you've read the ""Unisex Names"" Wikipedia page 🙄

Hmmm. Off the top of my head, some names that strike me as potentially non-binary -- and don't have a solely masc or fem connotation:

Noor / Nur (نور)

Nima (نعمة)

Iman (إيمان) 

Malak (ملك)

I'll think on it a bit though and see if I can come up with any more.
>I have to be an asshole here.

You *really* didn't. 

Trying to give ""tough love"" is frequently more about how the person giving it wants to feel rather than a sincere attempt to help. Case in point: you're claiming to know OP's ""moral ideological system"" better than they do. Meaning you have certain preconceptions against religion, and against Islam in particular. 

So what you achieved here wasn't giving the OP useful advice of any sort, you just came in and spewed Islamophobia. Downvotes are for people who don't contribute to the discussion, and as the OP indicates, you're not saying anything they haven't already heard.

When you do something that makes you ""outrageously unpopular"", it's good to take at least a second to consider if maybe that's because you actually did something wrong. If, in fact, before even saying it you come to the conclusion that it makes you ""an asshole"", you could also just not say or do that thing. Keep that in mind next time.
That definitely makes sense. I look so incredibly female that even though I dress completely like a man, even wearing a binder, nobody has ever even looked confused about my gender. Always calling me she. I hate it. And a hijab screams female. You're in a tough spot. I hope it helps that a bunch of strangers on Reddit recognize and accept you as an NB, hijab or not. 
Thanks :) It’s not the best situation, but whatever... 
I get that. If the secret is safe and that’s the way you need it to be, then good :) Your safety is absolutely a priority. 

As for the nagging voices that tell you the nasty stuff, tell them to F off! I’ve had them too and telling them to shut up is hard...
No problem 💚 I hate seeing when people try to police other folks existence
Also, just thought to add— my journey of self-discovery is absolutely something that has brought me closer to God, as I've come to Them in prayer and had it affirmed that I'm exactly who They made and intended me to be. I hope that's an experience you'll be able to have as well! There's definitely no charted path for those trying to navigate being religious and queer, but I have faith that God is mindful of us and will lovingly lead us and be with us wherever we're meant to go. <3
No worries! It's a funky little religion hah, always happy to answer any questions if you have them. :)

I'm out to a few supportive family members and friends, but the community as a whole is pretty conservative. The Church is still working on understanding and accepting our gay siblings, and lagging even further behind on issues of gender identity. But I have hope that especially with the younger generations, things are improving as time goes on! Honestly, a big part of why I'm trying to be authentic about my queerness in a religious setting is to open up those kinds of conversations, and hopefully be the change I want to see around me.

>the same back to you!

thank you!!
I'm not (yet) out to most my family. They're pretty LGBT friendly, but I'm still not quite sure how they'd react. I'm sure it won't be too bad, but I also haven't felt too compelled to come out to them for the time being. My parents do harass me a bit about the way I dress, even though I tone it way down around them. 

Don't know of any good resources, unfortunately - I've generally managed to explore both identities separately without too much internal conflict, but It would certainly be nice if there was more out there. 

PM me anytime! I'm excited to talk to you too. I don't think I've met any non-binary Muslims either!
Hello! I know it's been quite a while, but I just wanted to say that I've finished the character design - thanks in large part to you. If you'd like to see the character art, I would be happy to send it to you. And I would appreciate any feedback - I am NB, but not a Muslim, and so I'm sure there's always room for improvement.

&#x200B;

Thank you again for the help, and thank you for being you!

My friends and I jokingly call the stuffy, dogmatic Muslim men who tell the girls their jeans are improper and tell the boys not to stare at the girls the Haram Police. 


Maybe I'll have to start calling people who gatekeep trans communities Gender Cops.
I would *absolutely* love to see the character art! I'm not sure if you'd want to send it via message or email or what, but hit me up with a PM if you want my email address or some such.

I was happy to help out a bit and let me know if there's anything else I can do. Cheers!
>Maybe it's what they've already heard, because it's the truth. People who are religious are not immune from criticism, and it's not ""Islamophobic"" to suggest otherwise.

That's not at all what I was saying. 

I know there's not much point trying to argue with you, because you knew that saying this would make you an asshole and you decided that's what you wanted to be. But it's good to say these things for anyone who might be reading. So I'm gonna keep going, here:

First, if you're hung up on the Islamophobia part: rest assured that it's also very transphobic to say that trans people have to forsake their entire religious and cultural identities or they're not really trans. You might as well say that a trans person has to give up their US citizenship because the US discriminates against trans people. That's just conceding the whole thing to bigots.

To break it down for you: you're not, unless I've misread the situation, Islamic yourself. You are, therefore, basing your comments on negative preconceptions, and calling that ""the truth"" while ignoring the actual reality of the situation right in front of you. That's pretty much the definition of bigotry; in this case, Islamophobia. The preconceptions are that being queer and Islamic are inherently incompatible; the reality is, of course, that queer Muslims exist. 

Now, the definition of religion you use (""the entire purpose of a religion is to sacrifice portions of everyone's individuality for a communally decided greater good"") is so one-dimensional and reified as to be meaningless. Religion is an incredibly complicated phenomenon; the word encompasses an individual's internal relationship with the divine, the external community and cultural practices, and the complex interaction between those factors. It's not for me, as an outside observer, to say whether being nonbinary is incompatible with being Muslim--that's between OP and God. And they've already determined it's not. Their knowledge of their own faith is infinitely deeper than either of us can glean from a quick Wikipedia search made trying to score rhetorical points. 

Besides, to use something I *do* have experience with: pulling out random scriptural verses to argue that being trans or gay is wrong is what Christian bigots do. 

>EDIT: Oh, by the way, the only reason I labeled myself an ""asshole"" was a futile attempt to try to pre-emptively defend myself from the legion of people such as yourself who ignore reality in the pursuit of creative positive vibes, because people like you are all-inclusive right up to the point where someone challenges the way you think. Your concept of diversity is a really shallow, skin-deep alliance.

Oh, my mistake. I thought you were displaying self-awareness. But you've thoroughly corrected me by trying to gatekeep someone with different beliefs while also complaining about people who are ""all-inclusive right up to the point where someone challenges the way you think"".

(I'm not saying you're not trans or nonbinary, for the record. It would be nice if being trans meant you weren't bigoted, but those are, sadly, *also* not mutually exclusive categories.)
Lol, I hope that sticks 😂 it sums them up pretty well
[removed]
I am ex Christian and pretty anti organized religion so I get where you are coming from.


However, comments like yours tend not to help because whether you like it or not, people are raised in certain religious environments, or they discover a religion that has something that speaks to a part of them, and as a result will find themselves converting or devout.


Yes there are negative passages in religious texts such as those which you quoted. However, just as we have seen with Christianity, particularly the rise of unitarian Christianity, people have the agency to adopt or not adopt whichever religious beliefs or commands they wish. As a result, we have seen a big movement of liberal, unitarian Christianity that is pro LGBTQ. This option shows people who still want to be Christian that there is a community where they can love God but disregard the negative aspects of traditional religion.


Similarly we see this happening with Islam. While the negative Quranaic passages are certainly there, there is a growing movement of open, benign, modern Islam. Now I don't know about you, but I would much rather have a religion (with over a billion followers, so it's not going away any time soon) reform and modernize, with people such as OP leading this movement, than have only traditional, fundamental Islam the only option. I disagree with religion, however I recognize that to move forward there needs to be compromises. This compromise in this situation is supporting a progressive Islam, one that will hopefully spread and someday negate the objectionable aspects of the religion.

Hi I'm C. This is my first time posting anywhere as I'm sick and tired of other social media sources. I'm 36 years old, happily married, AMAB. I've been trying to discover my true identity for years, briefly thought I may be trans-feminine. I don't care about pronouns and answer to any of them.		"Your shirt is life.

It's also nice to see another enby who also doesn't have pronoun preferences; makes me feel less like a weirdo, lol.
Nice shirt.

Hi C, welcome!
I wonder how many nb people go by just one letter... I didn't like my birth name but didn't care about a new name. Ended up with ""J.""
Have you considered a septum or Medusa piercing? Both of those would look rlly nice on you. Also, have you ever filled your eyebrows in?
Trust me, there are plenty of us out there.
Thank you. :)
I've been on this journey for many years. It's 3 years now since I first had my official realization that I'm trans. But I started questioning myself when I was very young but like many others, I refused to accept it for myself.
I'm not sure. Ironically at first I had mixed feelings about if. One of my best friends used it once and it just stuck.
I have a nonbinary friend whose name is ""R""
I've had my brows waxed but never filled in. As far as piercings, was never my thing, don't have any."	e4s5or	NonBinary	112	0.99	2019-12-02 02:27:37
Can I use he/him pronouns and identify as non-binary?	"He/him pronouns are very comfortable for me, much more than any others. But, identifying as a man (FtM) just doesn’t feel right. I prefer being called a person rather than a man and partner over boyfriend. I am also attracted to women, but (this is gonna sound weird) not in a straight way. I can’t imagine myself in a straight relationship, yet I know I’m not a woman. Is it ok to use he/him pronouns but use gender neutral terms and identity as non-binary?

TL;DR - Basically the title.

Edit: Thank you all for the support! Each response makes me so happy to read :)"	"You can use what're pronouns you want. Doesn't mean anything gender wise
Absolutely 100%. Pronouns ≠ gender
Don’t overthink it too much! I’ve been there. I’m AFAB, but I don’t always feel like a female, not always like a male, sometimes both, and sometimes neither! I currently choose to go by any pronoun people see fit. 

It’s weird though for me.. I saw a TikTok that made so much sense. Essentially, it went like this:

Cis men see me as woman - no. 
Cis men see me as man - yes. 
Cis men see me as non-binary - yes. 

Cis women see me as man - yes. 
Cis women see me as woman - yes. 
Cis women see me as non-binary - yes. 

Queer people see me as woman - yes. 
Queer people see me was man - yes. 
Queer people see me as non-binary - yes.
Yuuuuup

My pronouns are she/her, as a non-binary trans gal. Granted, my gender is more binary-aligned than a lot of enbies, but you can absolutely use whatever pronouns make you comfortable.
Yes absolutely. I use he/she/they. U can use what u want.
There are no rules to being non-binary so you can use whatever pronouns you feel comfortable with
yes
Yes. 🙂
Pronouns doesn’t affect your gender. You can be non-binary and still use those pronouns
Demiboy vibes ✨ i relate
Eyup
You use whatever pronouns make you most comfortable =D
Yes pronouns don’t equal gender.
Absolutely! Pronouns have no gender and do not determine gender so you can use whatever pronouns feel most comfortable to you!
I'm basically the other way around! I like masculine terms but prefer neutral pronouns!   
Also there is spencer sunboy in tiktok, who also has he/him exclusively in his bio, but is still non-binary, so you're not alone!
Yes, end of the argument
absolutely. and i totally understand being masc and attracted to women in a non-straight way- i think its a pretty common experience.
Yes. Pronouns ≠ gender
Yep!!
Can I [....] And identify as non binary is always a yes. The only exception is when you fully, only, and all the time identify as a binary gender.
Yes
yes
Yeah absolutely! Pronouns =/= gender!
Non-binary trans mascs and demiboys are non-binary while using he/him pronouns
Yes
Pronouns don’t say anything about your gender
Most certainly.  Pronouns do not define your identity. Use what feels right. Some people won’t quite understand it but that’s ok. You don’t owe anyone an explanation.
Yes you can!
Yep I'm in a similar boat with she/her.
I wouldn't say that's true, he/she pronouns are definitely gendered for most people. They don't equal gender though."	w8awgj	NonBinary	112	0.98	2022-07-26 05:09:29

"Wildflower sex Shop attempts to copyright the word ""Enby"""	"Wildflower is a sex shop who has committed various gross acts like [systematically using Black femmes](https://medium.com/@evyan.whitney/dildont-disrespect-black-femmes-our-personal-experiences-with-wild-flower-sex-shop-c8d06ce7695f) to elevate their company and products without compensation, is now attempting to [own the rights to the word ""enby""](https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/12/03/shop-enby-wild-flower-sex-toy-lawsuit-trademark-trans-non-binary/) so that only they can use it. They actually sued a company owned by a [Black Trans owned company](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=000f3adf-6b27-4b14-9ce5-a7c3460fd8a8) for right to the word.

Both of the owners of the shop identify as Non-Binary and it's my personal opinion that they do not care about the enby community, the sex worker community, or Black lives more than philanthropy, and growing their business on the backs of those folks.

The owners are also quick to block and edit users and their comments on Instagram and Facebook, where they successfully control the narrative that they are inclusive and about equity.

All of this is because they believe that they deserve creative rights to a genderless sex toy that they created dubbed the enby.

The idea that a sex shop would try to co opt an identity and take it for their own as if they created it is within the very definition of white supremacy.

I personally find this racist, sexist, transphobic behavior from someone in the community absolutely unacceptable"	"Ugh yeah I'd heard about these folks shenanigans before. It's >_<
Someone actually owns the sole exclusive rights to a certain reindeer that may or may not have a red nose.

They found no one had actually copyrighted the idea, et voilà! Now technically nearly every reindeer with a red nose sold is copyright theft...

Just sayin' how ridiculous copyright and intellectual property laws are... They'll probably be able to copyright it, but it means very little ultimately. 

They can't stop anyone using the word ""Enby""; there's plenty of use of this prior to any copyright application, and there's caveats within laws that basically say no one can copyright words, otherwise Coca-Cola would have copyrighted ""Cola"". 

Doesn't make it any less insultingly stupid... Feckin' copyright trolls.
They're not trying to copyright it. They're trying to trademark it. It's a different type of intellectual property. What it means is that you can't sell goods or services under a substantially similar mark within the same industry. They couldn't get random people for using the word enby, only other people selling under the enby mark. I think the court will find that ""enby"" in relation to a sex toy shop is not a protectable mark as it describes or identifies the type of good sold. This wouldn't be the case if, for example, somebody did made a software company named ""enby"" that made accounting software. That would be a protectable use. Just hoping to provide a bit of background on why this isn't as big a deal as it seems, but yeah, fuck Wildflower!
Capitalism brings out the worst in people
The legal analysis was a great read!  But the silence since Nov makes me think Wildflower got paid big $$ to settle this out of court.  Which sucks.
Yeah they know this won't work. It's free publicity - please don't help in that regard. Best thing is to actually delete this if anything.
You could click their ad on google a bunch of times without shopping there. Google usually charges per click, it’s petty but if they won’t listen to the community telling them to drop the lawsuit we could a least be annoying and hit up their ad budget.
It is absolutely silly and rediculous. 
I also wanted to point out how damaging this behavior is and  why not to support them.
This cannot be overstated

I want to wake up from this nightmare
I disagree. Their target audience is queer folks and they peddle woke culture, I'd like to think that audience would shun them
It is. It really is. 

If they get the application successfully passed in France, for instance, anyone caught using / profiting from the word Enby can serve significant prison time.

And yet, it can't be worth more than a few thousand dollars to them as a name for a sex toy...

The real value would be in chasing infringement cases and loss-of-sales cases. 

But it's unlikely any case would get tested in court. A lawyer would basically send out a demand with an offer to settle out of court for maybe 50% of the demand (still could be tens of thousands!). People get scared and intimidated by what is effectively harassment, and pay the ""fine / demand / whatever"", or negotiate down to maybe 25% plus profit-share on future sales.

Totally nefarious and totally unnecessary. Intellectual Property laws need massive overhaul and global sign-off. No country/state should be able to dilute the law, nor undermine it.

Never gonna happen though, because it's highly doubtful China would sign any global copyright laws.
I see. Thanks for the clarification.
This surely is the realm of trademark laws and not copyright laws. In which case, the way it works in France is : it prevents others from calling a similar product the same name. If it is a product from a different industry (ie not a sex toy) it won't apply. And they absolutely can't prevent people from using the word in conversations.

The reason they were able to sue another shop is because that other shop also sold sex-toys. Fortunately, they have a legitimate defence: this is a common word that describes the product or its use so it can't be trademarked (eg: a cleaning company can't trademark the word ""clean"").

We can only wait and see what the judgement will be."	ou5ci6	NonBinary	109	1.0	2021-07-29 20:15:05
Being Acknowledged by Cishet People	"Ever since I came out as an enby I’ve only had relations with other queer people. I recently started seeing a cis guy, and I was quite anxious about how he would react to me being non-binary, my pronouns, body image etc. He was very understanding and very supportive to the point that he asked me if we could explain to his family that I’m non-binary together, because he wanted them to accept me as who I am. Even when I mentioned that I was uncomfortable with my breasts, he asked if I wanted to get too surgery and when I said yes, he said that he’d support me until the end. We recently started dating and he’s not slipping about calling me his “partner” and not a gendered term. 
I know these should be considered bare minimum and I probably shouldn’t be this happy about someone just respecting my identity, but god does it make me overload with joy. Being fully acknowledged, accepted and respected by people who don’t quite understand or relate to your identity is on a different level for me. His behavior has eased my anxiety so much and basically proved all of my fears wrong and I even feel like crying from happiness writing this."	"I’m so happy you’ve found someone who is supportive and accepting of your identity! Really glad you have that kind of person in your life. Wishing the best for the both of you.
u definitely should feel happy abt getting respect! it sounds like u might not have had all that much in the past
That's so great they support you
I love this for you! I've been struggling with getting people to use the correct terms, and it sucks because it also comes from other non-binaries. I physically cant present androgynous due to my masculine features but everyone defaults to he/him and man. The amount of times an 'ally' or other lgbt person has misgendered me and didnt seem to care is astounding. I'm beginning to think its because of how I look.
Yayyy! I'm so happy for you \^\^ I definitely get both sides of this, dating people that don't get it really, and then people that are super awesome about it even though they're cis! I wish you the best of luck.
This is so nice and sweet! I hope the best for you two
He sounds like a keeper and im happy youve found someone who is willing to support you through everything and is willing to go at a pace that makes you comfortable and helps your settle when you need it. Theres no alot of nice people in this world sad to say but when we meet em it makes it that more better and its warming youve found someone who down to earth i wish you all the best
Thank you so much!
I’ve mostly surrounded myself with queer people so it’s not too bad, but my family doesn’t know therefore it’s constant misgendering on their part and the family members who do know, along with the other cishet people that I’ve told, while not in bad faith, can’t really understand the situation therefore end up being a bit stupid around it haha. So it feels really nice to be accepted purely, no questioning involved. Thank you for your comment!
People alot of the time have that misunderstanding but theres quite a few reasons why it happens none of em your fault i might add but it could be people just dont know or they might be confused. But this is understandable it happens to me all the time and i usually listen to the tone if their voice as to if they are genuine or trying to insult me. If they are geuine ill politely correct them so they know in the future if they are trying to insult me ill pride my wsy through and say its my life not yours i csn do what i like snd it usually shuts them right up and ill walk away. Im not afraid to fight but ill never strike first (self defense law) i dont mean to mean but the best thing to combat it is to be thick skined and stick to your guns no one can get to you but you have a bite snd its part of being hsppy with yourself. The more you accept yourself the more people will accept you. Its like a saying from rupaul (roast me if you will but its a bloody good saying) if you can't love yourself how in the hell you gonna love somebody else. Ive misgendered alot of people so now i ask before i even start the conversation but you cant expect people to do that its like driving you treat everyone like an idiot. So you keep 2 seconds distance from the driver in front  and you watch what they do.

Sorry for the long post but i hope this helps 🥰
I totally agree, thank you so much for your comment! Best wishes for you toi"	sy8eoq	NonBinary	109	0.99	2022-02-21 23:48:56
I’m worried my boyfriend will leave me if I get top surgery	"So, my bf and I had a conversation last night about our identities and (I’ll admit maybe I should’ve waited to ask this) I asked if he would be less attracted to me if I got top surgery. His answer was yes. I know I asked for it and his feelings are valid, I just can’t help but worry now. Does he only want me for my body? Am I just a pair of tits? He says he will always support me but I’m worried I’m going to scare him off the further our relationship goes. He says he’s attracted to androgyny but I’m worried this will hurt our relationship in the long run. 

I needed to vent this and maybe seek advise. I just feel upset. How do I get over this issue of trust?"	"I feel you're looking at this the wrong way round

Your needs must come first here. If you believe top surgery is the correct choice for you, then your opinion _and only your opinion_ is important here

I know it's painful to consider, but if your boyfriend finds you less attractive as your authentic self and maybe even decides to not be in a relationship with you, that is _entirely_ on him

You deserve to be your fabulous, authentic self and to be surrounded with people who love and support you and help you to thrive
Just to put a different spin on it: just because he thinks you’ll be less attractive, doesn’t mean that he won’t still find you attractive. I don’t think my husband’s balding and graying hair is attractive, but I still find him attractive.
Our bodies change as we age. And also due to health issues. A person could have top surgery due to cancer, or have top surgery related to gender identity - end result is essentially the same, right?

So the question then becomes, ""Would you love me less if I had cancer and needed surgery?"" Most people would say they'd still love you. It shouldn't be any different for the same procedure for a different reason. 

Not really any kind of answer, but that's how I process this concept...
if you’re truly worried that the health of your relationship is balanced on the fact that you have breasts, then i think you’ve got *3* things you need to cut out of your life
As someone who put off transition for years because of what the people in my life would think about it, please learn from my mistakes. I recommend bringing it up with him again and emphasizing that top surgery is a thing that you want and need to happen. If he's only with you for your body or you changing your body is a deal breaker for him, you're much better off without him
There are multiple parts of this — for perspective, I am trans and nonbinary, have had top surgery (and just started testosterone), and am married, happily, to someone who expressed similar feelings beforehand.

Thing the first: These are perfectly valid feelings to have. Even I found my own boobs attractive and honestly very nice in a sexual context. But that isn't the reality my body is limited to, and my partner recognized that. It is realistic to acknowledge that boobs are very attractive for many people, and absence of boobs is strictly a downgrade along that axis. However, you know what is a strict upgrade even along that axis? The comfort and confidence and yeah, sexiness, that comes with feeling more at home in your body.

Thing the second: All that said, it might just be a first impression too. When I was first considering HRT as a someday future hypothetical, it really scared my partner. He was concerned that my transition goals would bring me out of the range that he finds people attractive— he is attracted to primarily fem-leaning folks after all! and if that is lost it would be a massive issue to him! (I am thoroughly asexual so didn't really appreciate how a decade-long relationship would be ruined by sexual attraction being lost. That's just my reality.🙄) But over time (it took around three years to reach the point of actually starting T) his thoughts and feelings about it matured and changed. By the time we were at that point, he was actively enthusiastic about me getting to start. 🥰 I brought it up, surprised at how positive he was seeming about it, and mentioned his concern from years ago. He was surprised I still held onto that — ""I only said that once, years ago."" ""Yeah well I've just anxiously held onto it since then!🙃"" ""Nooo, bad, you're not supposed to do that!"" So in conclusion, even if he does feel that way right now, if he loves you and is here to support you, then his feelings will likely shift over time in favor of supporting your comfort over this small part of his attraction to you. Try not to hold onto the worst parts of his opinions when his position might change. 🙂
He might but you can't control that. Ultimately you have to do what's best for you and exercise your bodily autonomy accordingly. You can't live in a body for the sake of another's attraction. Partners come and go but you got to live with yourself.  If he leaves he leaves. You can't force him to stay. Don't be angry. Now is the time to look for support outside of him.
My boyfriend at the time was very weird about my top surgery, saying over and over how it was just a big adjustment and he'd need time to get used to my body without something he enjoyed. While I celebrated with my friends I didn't discuss it with him. 

You deserve to be your authentic self and to celebrate milestones such as this. It sucks having your partner not be supportive of something so exciting.
i had this same issue, my ex told me he wouldn’t be attracted to me if i called myself non-binary. even after i told him i wouldn’t change anything about myself it would just be a label. ik it’s hard but it’s going to be better to break up with him and be your truest self and you’ll find an amazing supportive partner as soon as you’re ready. 

you are the priority, not the relationship. and if he doesn’t love you for who you are , no matter what your body looks like then what is the point? what if you got breast cancer and had to have them removed? would he not be attracted to his partner because they got cancer and had their boobs removed? it’s a weird thought process. but i hope you find someone perfect for you because this guy just isn’t it. 

i’m sorry about this experience. it’s definitely hard. all you want is a supportive partner but then they come out with this shit. you will find better, don’t worry.
this is an excruciating place to be, but your body's job is *not* to be attractive to your partner, it's to do all of the things bodies so for us. take us places, eat things, make things, relate to others, relate to ourselves. if your ideal body doesn't have tits, then your boyfriend's opinion can't change that.

i'd love to say it doesn't *matter* what he thinks, but the truth is that the idea of becoming unattractive to our partners is scary. if you're ""just a pair of tits"" to him, then that's easy, he's not worth your time! but reality is probably messier. I think the best thing you can do here is ask more questions about whether your relationship will change and how. *will,* not ""would;"" make it clear that this is something you want and will be doing.

this might make you uncomfortable, but I also want to say: *all* relationships change/end. the goal of a partnership isn't to make it last forever, it's to make it last as long as it is good, enjoyable, healthy, and meaningful to both of you. a lot of people find this idea terrifying, but I think it's better to make the most of a relationship while you're in it, rather than trying to make it last for ever.

this is also the place where I plug non-monogamy! it becomes a lot easier to navigate stuff like this if one relationship doesn't have to satisfy all your romantic, sexual,  and nesting needs. if you have multiple partners, it's no big deal when your relationships change. my wife and I have had a non-sexual relationship for almost 10 years now, but it's not a problem, because we both still get our sexual needs met. rather than trying to force sex to happen in a relationship that's grown out of it, we're free to be wholly present in what our relationship has become. in that context, I would argue that even if your boyfriend *was* less attracted to you, that wouldn't necessarily mean he loved you any less, or that your relationship with him was less valuable.
Who cares what he thinks? 

If he’d leave you for that then he was never worth your time anyway, right? He wasn’t the right person for you. 

Don’t hold yourself back for the comfort of others.
With posts like this I always wonder if these people dated a cis person that developed a condition that changed how their bodies looked- breast cancer and getting a double mastectomy, PCOS and facial hair, prostate cancer and dealing with erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia and cis men developing breasts, etc etc etc- if they would feel the same way. 
It isn’t the same at all as being trans or non-binary and changing your body to be how you feel is comfortable, presenting how you want, etc, but like… it’s just wild to me that bodies, even without HRT and gender affirming surgeries, even without various conditions and illnesses. Bodies are not eternally in one form. 
I just have a hard time imagining a situation in which I would no longer be attracted to someone because their body changed in some way shape or form. If I love someone and am attracted to them, then… that’s it. I love them and am attracted to them. Regardless of what may come. 

I know this probably isn’t helpful at all, and I’m sorry I absolutely just rambled and it’s probably barely coherent, but it’s something I’ve been thinking about a lot as a non-binary person myself. 
I wish you the best, friend.
If he is attracted to androgyny, then wouldn't the top surgery not affect the attraction. And for all he knows you could be getting it for medical reasons. People putting attraction into tits is very stupid as it stresses people out to not wanting to remove them even if it will be better for one's health because they don't want their partner to be upset. You are more than tits and shouldn't think of yourself any less for having awesome tits or removing your tits. Besides you can always get some fake tits for him to play with if that is what he wants.
Can we trade? I want the nonbinary eqivalent of boobs (I call them ""thoobs"")!   


In all honesty, yea. I agree with numerous posts here already.   
If your BF is this fickle on your appearance and how much he is attracted to it, I'm gonna be painfully blunt with this (brace if you need it): >!""Your BF, if you change how you look in any capacity, leaves you, then he was NEVER there for who you really are."" !<I apologise, but it's true. If your right play for who you are as a person is to say, ""y'know, I am going to get top surgery"". And he won't support or be with you for/after it, then yeah. The quote (in the censor) is right. >!""...he was never there for who you really are.""!<   
I've not dealt with this kind of situation, thankfully, but it boils all down to ""What will make you comfortable and make you more ***you***?"" 

&#x200B;

I hope that made sense. I'm caffeinated and doing a workout while typing this, so I hope my ADHD, caffeine mind made that clear. I'll clarify if you got a question. But hope it helped on some form.
I have a hetero boyfriend , and now 3 years after my surgery we are still together. and it took an extra year of therapy with a sexologist ( delaying my surgery)  but he saw how unhappy I was then, and knows I am much happier now.
Your needs come before his at this point if this is important to you and he can’t see it then, he’s not worth being around.
My husband left me after helping me through all of my surgeries. Instead of going with my gut, l kept telling myself, but he's supporting me with all of this. He wasted 6 years of my life pretending he'd be okay with something he clearly wasn't. Ask yourself why you're willing to sacrifice your personal happiness to stay with someone who doesn't care about yours. If you're having the fear of it happenin,  that should tell you they already don't make you feel safe or accepted. You DESERVE better. He's literally telling you he's only attracted to your body. Tits doesn't equal androgynous. NO tits doesn't equal androgynous. Either way looks and our bodies change. If you got breast cancer & had to remove them would he leave?
I postponed my transition bc I was afraid of my loved ones reaction. This just lead to me getting a ton of anxiety. I ended up transitioning anyways, bc I couldnt live otherwise.

Give your partner time to process this, but regardless of his opinion, your happiness comes first
Don't compromise yourself or your needs because someone else wants you to remain how you are.

It's really not worth it, and long term if you relent and don't get top surgery, in all likelihood your relationship won't last.

You should probably discuss this in depth with him. 

Be honest about your transition goals and assert that this is how you are, and if he isn't attracted to you (post surgery)  that you're just not going to be compatible.

Transitions happen, people lose interest. It's not uncommon for couples to break up over these differences. You will get through this and find someone who loves you as you truly are; should you end up parting ways.
you should never not transition just to please a partner. also, it sounds to me like he enjoys your chest but is there for you, not your body. you should be happy he answered honestly cuz it could have been held off until it came out eventually in a more difficult situation. even if he didn’t support this you should still advocate for yourself and ease your dysphoria. you are the most important in your transition!
If that’s the case, then it’s not meant to be. I (AMAB) had an ex who left me because I was presenting too feminine. He (a gay man) was never mean spirited about it, but he was honest. I was upset because we had been so close, but ultimately it was for the best for us both.

There’s no villain to this story. He wouldn’t have told you the truth if he didn’t respect you. Now that it’s out in the open, you have to deal with it. You asked because you wanted to know, because intuitively you knew if the answer was yes, then the relationship’s days were numbered. This will come up again if you try to ignore it.

It’s painful, but you deserve someone who finds YOU attractive, without conditions.
when I asked the same question and got the same response it was one of the things that pushed me to recognize the relationship wasn’t what i wanted
My fear is that it's harder for us queer folks to link up and find compatible matches, some of us (myself included) don't have family anymore because of our transness.

So loosing a potential partner can be a whole lot scarier for us, because it can lead to way more isolation and self doubt.

I'm one of those people.  I've asked my partner this same question and his response has been interesting.
He admitted that he likes the feminine parts, but at the end of the day, he's in love with me as myself.  Not the skin I'm in, and certainly not a version of my body that makes me unhappy.

It's like when people say ""I only have a thing for redheads."" But still fall in love with people who may not even have that hair color.

If you'd met your partner and you'd have already been flat chested, do you think he still would have got to know you and liked you?
Last year I ended a seven year relationship with someone I’d planned to start a family with, in large part because of his feelings about my physically transitioning. It’s been really, really hard, but it was the right decision and I’m so happy that I stopped holding myself back from doing what was right for me. There’s been a lot of grief and mourning but also joy and freedom. And now I’ve found a boyfriend who loves me for who I am as well as who I’m becoming and that’s been wonderfully healing.

That’s not to say I think your relationship should end. I truly hope the two of you will be able to work it out, because that’s of course the best case scenario. But I just want to say from someone who’s been through it that doing what feels right to your body is more important than even a relationship that you really love.
Relationships are emotional, and physical. If my partner fell In love with me and then I changed, that might cause issue, but love is also a choice. You choose to be by someone’s side. Relationships are complex. And everyone is different. Most important.. LOVE YOURSELF.
Sounds like your boyfriend has settled on what *his* version of your ideal form should be, and that's someone with breasts.

If he's more attracted to lumps of fat with nipples than to you as a person, trying to be true to yourself, you need to ask yourself if this is even a person you wanna spend any time with at all.
This is going to sound way harsher than I intend it to be but he’s just your boyfriend and not a husband or anything. I’m not at all saying you have to be married to love someone but what it boils down to is your love for him/your relationship and your love for yourself.

I would talk a bit more with him about your identity. Explain your identity to the best of your abilities if you want to and ask how he sees you. How different things might affect your relationship and things like that. Communication is very important in any relationship.

I’ve had to talk with my girlfriend a few times because while she is my biggest advocate she also can do or say things that trigger my dysphoria whether she means to or not. Her best friend (fellow enby) has had to correct her a few times about things she’s said to me. She never means harm and always apologizes but she doesn’t /get/ it sometimes.

So just talk to him about how you feel and see how he feels. More information will help if you feel like there are any decisions to be made.
I do think that a lot of times people look at relationships too black and white, and think there always has to be someone in the wrong. Imo, sometimes people just aren't compatible and that's okay.

OP is discovering themselves and becoming more authentic to themselves. Maybe they thought they were compatible with their bf before, but maybe their bf just isn't compatible with who they really are. It's a problem a lot of binary trans people have where their partners are attracted to their birth sex and not their true gender, and that's not their fault. We in the LGBTQIA+ community should understand better than anyone that we don't control our attraction.

So yeah, I think pinning the blame on one person isn't fair.

With that said, if the bf loses interest completely just based off of breasts alone, either he's a shallow asshole or the relationship was never that strong for him anyway. It's also possible though that he's being honest about what exactly he's attracted to but does not mean he'd love OP any less, so we can't really jump to conclusions yet.
As a transfem early in my transition, I'm facing similar fears about my wife. I know this is the rational take, which is why I was able to even start my medical transition.  Heck, my wife even said as much.  But it still really helps to read it reiterated so effectively by others.  Thanks!
Thank you :,), this is very helpful. I just really don’t want our relationship to end over something like this and I guess it’s hard to recognize that what I want is the most important sometimes. Ugh why is it so difficult 😞
Thank you 🥹 Yeah that’s what I’m hoping for but at the same time if it’s enough of a lack of attraction then the sexual aspect of our relationship will be ruined. I won’t know until I get the surgery though :/
I appreciate it
Thank you so much for this. This is also how I was thinking. I think he has the ability to change. He’s really only worried about not being AS sexually attracted to me. I’m not planning on getting top surgery now or in the next couple of years. So it will probably be revisited. He told me to “let him cook” lmao so I guess I’ll see. I’m hoping things will work out because he really doesn’t want to separate and maybe that’s a sign he really wants to try. I guess I’m worried about being able to trust what he says about how he feels and it’s something I’m working on.
Thank u for this :) and yeah, I want to be able to celebrate with him but I’m worried the masculine I become the more he’ll pull away and I want someone who grows with me and loves me more for it. It’s so difficult :/
Thank u. That’s what I was thinking too. What if there’s a different need that I get them removed. Or what if I lose a limb or get a whole bunch of tattoos. There are lots of reasons someone’s body may change abruptly (obviously some are chosen and others are not). I always want to argue to him and ask him if this is how he’d feel about anything I do to my body/that happens to my body but at the same time I understand he can’t change what he’s attracted to. I just want more clarification I guess :/ like is our relationship that surface level? Do I even have a right to argue him on this? 😩
Thank you this was very helpful :). I’m happy to know I’m not alone and this is basically the mindset I’ve had too. He doesn’t want to separate and I believe he’s willing to try. But I might bring that up to him. I’m not sure of a good way to do so though.
Hahaa so right! I didn’t even think about the fake tits lol thank u 😊
This was really helpful and I appreciate the support. I understand too and I think we need to talk about it more if he can actually organize his thoughts for a convo :/
I hope mine can recognize this 🥲
it’s completely valid to end your relationship over this. it’s who you are. being comfortable in your own skin is #1 priority. you deserve to feel happy when you look in the mirror and not wish that certain parts are/aren’t there. if he’s the only thing keeping you from pursuing then he isn’t worth it. 

i hope you have a great week
Just keep in mind that physical attraction is only part of attraction as a whole. He may be less physically attracted to you post op but doesn't mean he wouldn't still want to be in a relationship with you after but that still doesn't mean you should sacrifice your happiness for it.
Yesss, ""let me cook"" sounds like explicit intent to let himself change the way he thinks about your chest over time. That honestly sounds very positive as a first impression. 🥰
I know you are probably very sensitive about this since it hits so close to home, but I want to reiterate two equally valid things: you can do whatever you need to feel the best you possibly can in your body (and fuck other people’s judgements) and your boyfriend can lose attraction to you (and maybe you break up because of that). Neither of those things make either of you assholes. 

At the end of the day, we’re all learning, growing, and changing. These changes then impact our relationships. If you grow apart from someone or they grow apart from you, that’s okay–it’s part of the process. Your top priority is to your health, your wellness, and your comfort in your own skin. If you don’t feel valued in the way you want, you don’t need to judge the other person, you just need to move on. I wish you the best of luck and grace in navigating this–it’s a tough situation for sure.
Thank you. This gives me hope :)"	110ihr5	NonBinary	103	0.98	2023-02-12 15:37:14
