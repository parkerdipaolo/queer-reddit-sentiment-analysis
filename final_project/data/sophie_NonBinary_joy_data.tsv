A comic I made about the simple things that keep me going ‚òÄÔ∏è What are some of the little things that give you queer joy?		"DOUBLE TROUBLE :DDD

Also if you like trans and enby cartoon characters, watch Owl House and Dead End, Paranormal Park
[deleted]
Seeing cisgender dudes post pictures of themselves wearing tutus and makeup, or young pretty girls with completely shaved heads. Just stuff that helps to weaken the binary <3
All those things honestly! I also really love getting complimented on my hair or makeup by girls that come in where I work. It's so sweet and makes me feel seen to some degree. ü•∫
No.1 and No.3 are whole ass moods. Also, Stevonnie? Someone has good taste i see.
Things that bring me queer joy:

- loving and dating other trans people.  We understand each other‚Äôs bodies so innately, no matter what crazy thing we‚Äôre doing it feels so natural and real.

- i love seeing other trans people in the wild, and seeing each others beauty.

- i love it when kids stare at me in public, and i get to see the wonder in their eyes as they realize that there‚Äôs this whole new type of human.  i love it when kids ask me if i‚Äôm a boy or a girl, and when i say non-binary they‚Äôre *always* like, ‚Äúokay‚Äù like it totally ain‚Äôt no thing.

- i love it that i have all of my emotions now!  That i‚Äôm _allowed_ to cry when i‚Äôm sad, and wear whatever the fuck i want because i feel like it.
This!
is the middle trans character lup from taz or are there more trans elves im unaware of
Najimiiiiiiiiii
seeing other people‚Äôs post-op top surgery pics! it gives me hope that I will get there too, one day :))
Yesss I love me some Double Trouble!!


Weirdly enough, stretching and being able to see my own armpit hair gives me complete euphoria. I spent so long shunning it that embracing it has been the single most validating thing I've done with my body so far.
In the most flattering way she looks like Rose Lalonde
I've seen some of your comics posted here and just have to say they always put a smile in my face! I love your art style
Literally me istg (except for the makeup one so far) lmao
I'm a comic book author myself and have been puting a lot of my gender euphoria on my pages. Loved the comic. I so can relate. Gonna start follow your work from now on :)
Comics like this always make me smile, so thank you kind stranger! 

Most recently though, getting complements on my side shave and people saying it really suits me and my personality. That makes me so happy I have to fight back tears sometimes. 

And finally, a smaller thing is wearing pride bracelets that I make. I‚Äôm in the closet around the majority of people in my life and know one really knows the pansexual, agender, or non-binary flag colors, so I wear them to bring myself a bit of extra happiness without having to fear being outed to others.
Miniskirts
Queer chicks in shows
Big hoodies that hide my curves
DT DT DT!!! I love them sm (and catra)
Having a day where my long hair is *just right* that I can glance in the mirror and think mmmm are you a hot guy or a hot girl, who tf cares üòé 

Or a nice baggy tshirt/jumper that erases all the dysphoria about my large chest so I can feel like a cool dude without having to bind my whole chest down and feel uncomfortable.

Chilling on the sofa with some beers watching f1 with my partner like ""one of the lads"".

And honestly my partner finding my jokes really funny and taking my opinions seriously as a complete equal. Like...something is wrong with a his PC so he asks me to fix it üòç or he explains what work he is doing on his motorbike and I can help out.

Oh reminds, motorbike gear. Ahhhh sooo good to have massive shoulders lol
seeing other trans people happy brings me so much queer joy. also, for me, getting called stuff like dude, man, guy, etc or affectionate masculine terms.
Imagine being able to mistake yourself for hot
Literally the opposite of most of these but I'm glad y'all are feelin' it!
Oof I wish!
Finding clothes can be hard but when it clicks it‚Äôs a great feeling!!

Does anyone have suggestions on where to find hairbands like the first panel?  Working with a larger head has been giving me a headache!
I love Raine from Owl House!! Still need to see Dead End.
Yes Najimi Osana is their name and they‚Äôre great! I gotta check out Bugsnax now, I didn‚Äôt know that. Awesome!
Yes!! Love that!
I love that!! So affirming
Love this ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è thank you for sharing!
They're double trouble from she-ra (canonically non-binary, using they/them pronouns)
It‚Äôs Double Trouble from She Ra! They‚Äôre kind of a lizard lol
Awesome!! I‚Äôm sure you will :)
That‚Äôs so great for you!! Happy to hear that
Thank you :)
Yessss üíö
This made me smile! I‚Äôm so glad you have this üß°
i haven‚Äôt seen she-ra and honestly i don‚Äôt think i ever will but it‚Äôs sick that there‚Äôs a canon nb character!
now that you say that, their character design does remind me of a salamander character i once had for a ttrpg campaign
It's the little things because I realised I'm too scared to have top surgery, too large to use binders properly, and get too much dysphoria when using bras etc that I have to use, otherwise, I'd hurt my back.

&#x200B;

So I've been having to find ways that work for me, and I know that means I look more femme than I want to most of the time, but those little things I mentioned help me get through the day.

&#x200B;

It is a little bit funny, to be honest that I often feel my most ""masc"" when I have put on make up and a dress. I think because I tend to go really heavy on the eye make up and a bit OTT with it. It's like I'm masc doing drag."	zcfe2u	NonBinary	2475	1.0	2022-12-04 17:16:28

My genuine reaction after seeing this wasn‚Äôt, huh that goes against society or that‚Äôs weird. It was more like, huh good looking human in a cute outfit... and I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôve finally reached a point in my life where I‚Äôve overcome the internalized transphobia.

Got an email today from the government, and they used the gender neutral honorific! I almost had tears of joy !		"There *is* one?!!  Dope!  Congrats!
Awesome!!
Nice!!
I'm curious about that what government is inviting you to haha.
That‚Äôs awesome! But you don‚Äôt live in the U.S. do you‚Ä¶?
Yes, we love to see it!! I got an email from my state board of pharmacy, and even though they force you to choose a ""gender"" of male or female, they honored my request to be addressed as Mx. \[insert name\]. It felt so good!
That's great :)
THATS SO COOL WHAT
WOOOOOOOO
Amazing! Which government?
Wow that's amazing! I think I might start using mx. Also I know it's specific but those are some very neat nails! Congrats friend!
This is super intriguing to me.  My brother works at a law firm and asked me about honorifics the other day because one of his co-workers said they aren‚Äôt supposed to use ‚ÄòMx.‚Äô on official documents.  They didn‚Äôt provide an alternative, so my brother was curious what nb people would prefer?
[removed]
hey!! thats so cool! I‚Äôm a trans guy and im kinda clueless about enbies. How do you pronounce mx? Congrats btw this is amazing
This is awesome, and honestly, why does our govt need to know our gender anyway? Why can‚Äôt we all be Mx, and you have to fill out a form if you want the govt to refer to you by gender? One day‚Ä¶
Happy for you :)
[removed]
Which government, exactly? Asking for a friend.
There's a couple I know of. 'Mx' (pronounced mix), 'M' (pronounced mist) and 'Mm' (pronounced mistrum)
Lol just a survey through my work. Nothing too exciting!
Did some Reddit stalking and it appears they are from Canada
There's truly no better feeling than gender euphoria, especially when it's unexpected! I'm glad you're being addressed how you want to :)
Canada! Specifically the Yukon
Haha thank you!
I can't speak for all nonbinary folks, but I know many people don't like honorifics at all and prefer just to be addressed by their name. Mx is getting more popular, and I've heard of M (mist) and Mm (mistrum). I can't imagine why Mx wouldn't be okay on official documents though... it's a nonspecific title that isn't granted through official means. Mind you I'm Canadian so perhaps we have different rules in that regard.
Hahaha thank you! I'm a nurse so my hands are usually dry and just awful. I'm glad they look good here haha
It's pronounced mix! And thank you :)
It's not a pronoun, it's an honorific
Ty for your input buttfucker joe
Bro made a whole ass account just to be an unfunny troll üò≠üò≠
Yukon, Canada.
Haven‚Äôt heard of the other two, just Mx., I love M and how it‚Äôs pronounced!
Freaking love this.  üòç
Also

* Per (Person)
* Ind (Individual)
* Myr (Mystery)

As far as banks go HSBC UK also support a bunch of others some of which I'm not actually familiar with https://www.hsbc.co.uk/help/banking-made-easy/change-of-gender

Mx. is the most popular it'd seem tho
ALRIGHT MOVING TO CANADA FOR SOME VALIDATION
Yup I'm Canadian.
Ah, yeah, my brother and I are both from the US, but we live on opposite ends of the country, and I don‚Äôt think there are any national laws about such a thing?

We both understand dropping honorifics all together, but that could be seen as ‚Äòinformal‚Äô for a law firm; so he asked me (as the only out nb person he knows) if I knew of any other honorifics/titles that were popular.  I‚Äôll definitely tell him about M (mist) and Mm (mistrum) though!
And delete it right after, in other words, it's useless"	pk63g4	NonBinary	1700	1.0	2021-09-08 07:57:27

I‚Äôm only 6 months on low dose T but my lil fuzz beard brings me so much joy.		"After six months on low dose t all I got was acne... with everyone had the same genes as you to be able to grow hair that fast lol. Congrats
Such a big milestone ü•∞ I don't know you, but I'm sending you so much love and kindness straight from my heart. Keep being you and celebrate each those beautiful changes that help you be your true self. It's beautiful to see it happening, truly ‚ô•Ô∏è
I make my own t and am 30 years old and you‚Äôve got about as much as me. Congrats!
That beard is SO fantastic!
I love this video omg. Besides the fact that the framing in the camera is v aesthetic, I can feel your joy through the screen!!! You look awesome, I‚Äôm so excited for you & your beautiful fuzz beard!!!!!
Looking good. My beard is all fucky cause during the time it started growing I was at an extremely stressful time in my life and it's half normal, half grey, and also it grows in the most absurd patterns possible so I keep is short
You are gonna look so crazy good with a full beard
MtF here and you already have more facial hair than me, it looks so good!!
i grow that much overnight just by shaving ü§£
so happy for you!!
YAY!!! so exciting!!!!!
I love this for you! Congrats!
looking good!! üòç
That‚Äôs freaking awesome!

More impressive beard than I‚Äôve grown in two years on T
Wait, I‚Äôm obsessed with this perspective of filming the footage from a digital camera‚Ä¶
AH HECK YEA DUDE
Nice!
Man fuzz!!
Kick ass beard to grow in 6 months!! May I also say your voice sounds awesome?
29 years born a man and i cant grow this much hair.
Lmaoo I was thinking that because I don‚Äôt do anything to it. Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I've been on low dose T since March and I have the shadow of a mustache, 1 hair on my jaw, and increased leg hair. So... Something is happening. I am not on T for hair growth though, so I'll probably remove it. But it's affirming in a way to need to remove it.
Awww you got me smiling!! Thank you so much ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

I had wonderful weird little moment of non-binary joy with a man on West Virginian backroads, and now it‚Äôs art		"Art is by Ana ([@ana_piranha_ on Instagram](https://instagram.com/ana_piranha_?utm_medium=copy_link)) ‚Äî follow them!

I posted the full story behind this interaction on Twitter: https://twitter.com/avietweets/status/1419825097444139010?s=21
Woah, what a powerful experience!
My kid said, ""that's the dream dude!""
One time I was in makeup and fem clothes (I'm AMAB) and went to a bar with a friend of mine.  I heard someone say to their friend ""Is that a guy or a chic?""  I felt proud.  That was almost 3 years ago now and I still hold on to that one.
Is that a goal? I'm confused.
everybody say thank u clint mcelroy
I absolutely love this and the story behind it. Thanks so much for sharing your story. I'm a few steps behind you in this non-binary journey, but I hope I can get to where you are someday.
The post on the story behind it was a very cool read : ) I love the way you wrote it and the visuals. Thank you for sharing!
This is why I like being bro'ed.
Wow, I love your story. Most of my questioning was just spent laying in my bed lol
Thank you for sharing the story. Beautiful.
Yes! When people look at me I want them to feel confused and turned on.
For me, it was a euphoric moment! For others it may not be. Androgyny isn‚Äôt the same as being non-binary and there aren‚Äôt any visible traits that are necessary to be non-binary.

Speaking for myself, people usually make assumptions about me based on my height (6‚Äô2‚Äù) and voice, so I was excited to put a little gender chaos out into the world and have it spoken back and validated. Especially in such an unexpected place.
Yeeeeeeees!
You‚Äôll get to where *you* are. You already are! And you‚Äôll continue to become even more you. :)

Transition isn‚Äôt a before/after or a me/you.

It is a was, an is, and a becoming. Enjoy the journey! üíñ
Bed is a great place to question, too. And the shower! I feel like I have a lot of breakthroughs in the shower haha
Yes, let me help someone discover they like something they may not have known before by just existing and not having to do any of the emotional labor with them.  Lol. Helping with minimal effort.
I appreciate the clarification. Thank you
I eagerly look forward to that first time someone poses the question to me! Similar thing with my height/voice, but I'm probably going to look to train my voice to androgyny.

it's Non Binary People's Day!!	"I've made a lot of discoveries about myself in the past 8 months. finally embracing that i'm not female took a lot of pain, tears and work. I have reshaped many of my beliefs and discarded the toxic ones. ultimately, it has been SO rewarding. Even my happiest moments as a female pale in comparison to the contentment, joy and confidence I feel now. I no longer have thoughts that I don't feel like either gender. I feel like me. The real, authentic me. 

To all my fellow enby pals- You are not alone. You look non-binary enough. No matter where you are on your journey, you're valid. Just choosing to embrace yourself in a world that taught you to do otherwise is so freakin valid. And it makes you pretty darn cool."	"Happy Enby Day! You are valid! However you choose to label! Just be yourself :)

I have been identifying as non binary for close to a decade now.
My mum texted me saying that today was this and wished me a good day, felt really sweet but I was surprised too!
Thanks, same feeling over here, roughly the same time-frame, just from the opposite AGAB. Thank you for expressing what I feel üòò

And to all my fellow Enbys: Happy Non-Binary day.

Today is also Le 14 Juillet! (Bastille Day)

Fuck Yea! Let us celebrate with dancing and juice!
I love this for you! In the last two years and have come to terms with that I don‚Äôt feel feminine or masculine. Rather I feel like I as I age I am more of an experience and becoming comfortable with not boxing myself or being boxed in if I can help it. Non-binary feels like home even though I am cis presenting
Ohh I had no idea! Happy enby day!
I didn't even know we had a day.  I need to celebrate.

Aww that's so nice! I wish I had support like that. You're very lucky.
Be very thankful of her support. Happy enby day
You're welcome! feels good to hear that from a fellow enby ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Sounds awesome! I'm in lol
Sounds fun!
You're welcome! üòä
Transgender describes an internal experience of gender that doesn't align solely and completely with one's AGAB. All non-binary identities fall under the transgender umbrella. Please don't gatekeep how other people identify. Thank you!
Dude, come on.

This would be bad enough on any other day buy *specifically* today?
Nice!
That's awesome! üòä

I am proud of my own identity and community, and how it fits within the hierarchical nature of the labels we've evolved to describe various aspects of people's experiences of gender. I don't expect to sway your opinion, but I will say, if you don't consider yourself non-binary, you may want to check yourself on why you're in a non-binary space dictating to non-binary people what words we use to identify ourselves. That's the same thing most trans folks criticise TERFs for doing. If you don't want us to use the label trans, thanks for letting us know. You can leave now.
The white in the transgender flag literally means those those who are gender neutral and non binary? Non binary people are trans mate.
I agree, it sounds very close to gender critical anti-trans activism. üïµÔ∏è
Yeah. Absolutely. I'm proud to say that im Non Binary and Trans. Some said to me, that not everybody knows that non Binary falls under the Trans Umbrella. My answer everytime:""Then I let them know.""

You can be binary trans. I am non binary trans :)

Non-binary people are transgender as AGAB is historically limited to M/F.

Not all trans people are non-binary.

I appreciate the effort, but this user is self-described as truscum. The basis of that is gatekeeping who is and is not allowed to use the term transgender, and pathologizing non-cis gender experiences. They will not be swayed by things like logic because they are committed to defending their definition of their identity label, such that that commitment becomes *part* of the identity. No amount of ""all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares"" is going to sway them.

That just sounds like religion with extra steps. üòÇ
Dude I knew there was a place for it, because I experienced it in real life, but that community is so toxic and ignorant. Fuck that was triggering seeing some of the same things that prevented me from realizing I was non-binary written down.
Your definition is false. Transgender means not aligned with gender assigned at birth, as many here have pointed out to you. You are not being non-binary, you're being non-sensical üòã"	vytpfy	NonBinary	513	1.0	2022-07-14 11:34:55

I‚Äôm finally dating someone who is attracted to *all* of me!	"I‚Äôm afab and genderfluid, and I‚Äôm not sure where my sexuality falls but I am heaaaavily more attracted to men than to women. I recently broke up with a cishet man who would only ever use she and they pronouns for me in fear of being seen as gay. He didn‚Äôt even like me dressing masculine because it was ‚Äúconcerning‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. yeah I am now realizing I should have dumped his ass wayyyyyy sooner. 

Im now dating abother man who does not identify his sexuality, although he is heavily attracted to women and slightly attracted to men, but holy mother of fuck does he ever change the game. He calls me his boyfriend when I feel masculine, even in front of his French catholic parents! He respects and defends my pronouns and has even told me he does not care how I identify, as long as I stay the same personality he will still want to be my boyfriend. 

I have never felt joy so pure and it is insane how much I love him."	"That‚Äôs so nice to hear, I‚Äôm super happy for you. People like your boyfriend sound rare, so it‚Äôs always nice to hear other people be comfortable with who they are and who they date no matter what others might think.
Yay I‚Äôm happy for you :)
Congrats!! Super happy for you!!!
> I recently broke up with a cishet man who would only ever use she and they pronouns for me in fear of being seen as gay. He didn‚Äôt even like me dressing masculine because it was ‚Äúconcerning‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. 

I'm really happy you found someone who loves you for who you are.

It sounds like that last person just plainly wasn't attracted to your gender but tried to force you to restrict your gender to the parts he was attracted to. That fucking sucks.

You can't make someone who's gender fluid stop being fluid for the sake of your own sexuality and attraction. They are who they are, and you either are down with that or you aren't.

I'm glad you found someone who's down with that.
We've all been with at least one ""but can I still call you my girlfriend?"" guy. I'm glad you found someone who respects you.
aww that's so sweet
That sounds lovely, happy you found each other!
uWu
You sound so very lucky.
Now that‚Äôs a good partner right there
Yay!!!! this is so precious to hear
Yes go you!!!
That is so sweet! Happy for you :).
Omg, the ""I don't care how you identify, as long as your personality stays the same"" is a really good way to put that. I had someone say something like that to me. I hope we get back together once the rough times are over. He would even use they/them pronouns for me around his family, and if he didn't wanna explain it, he just wouldn't (his attitude was that it didn't matter if they questioned it, though he was worried his family wouldn't get it and wouldn't accept me anymore, we spent a lot of time at his house). Now, even though we barely see each other anymore because he's busy at school and work, he is trying to use my chosen name, which is something I was worried about, because when I talked to him about changing it before, he said it would feel weird and he wasn't sure he could adjust to the change (not the best thing to hear, I know). But now he's trying and I really appreciate it, and he was really happy for me when I changed my name legally, and really supportive when I talked to him about my parents having issues with calling me by it."	r3e8zh	NonBinary	438	0.99	2021-11-27 14:06:47

I‚Äôve wanted longer nails for 17 years. I‚Äôm so freakin‚Äô pleased right now. What tiny joys are keeping you going, Team?		"I've been writing a lot lately, getting my own thoughts out has been cathartic especially when I'm writing queer stories.  Taking back power over my own story through my writing is small now when it's mostly unpublished, because yeah, for now, it's only for my eyes, but eventually maybe it'll grow into something bigger.
I just got new kittens so it‚Äôs more of a major thing than minor. I‚Äôm just so freaking thrilled to have these little babies to care for.
My beard is getting thicker and the bald spots on my chin are starting to fill in! (Transmasc, 2 years 9 months on T and 3 weeks post Hysterectomy!)
my hair is almost long enough to tie into a pony tail, and this time I'm not caving to peer pressure and cutting it.
Rn it‚Äôs the fact that my hair is almost long enough for me to pull it back, and I think I‚Äôm gonna ask out my coworker on Saturday
Having the gender on my driver‚Äôs license being X keeps me going
Got my first packer today, not knowing if it would improve or worsen my dysphoria, and to my surprise it feels great!
My doctors using my preferred name and pronouns even though I haven't legally my name yet. Also I love this for you! Feeling comfortable in your own skin in any way you find suits you is the best
Not related to being nb but Amphibia (Wally specifically), Christmas lights, and fiddles
Your nails look very nice! While scrolling, I thought this was from one of the nail subs I'm in. Two of my joys are maintaining my nails and making time to read books. It's something I didn't do for a while, but finally got back into it.
Wearing heeled boots and nail polish in the office systematically recently and I notice a whole lot of very senior women in the company who I've never really met before are greeting me with a smile now, feels like I'm joining a new club somehow.
Started working on knitting socks again. It feels good
Just mustered up the courage to add my chosen pronouns to my Handshake profile. Took some time to get there, but, I‚Äôm done hiding for other‚Äôs comfort.
Your excitement
I‚Äôm visiting the Great Frozen North for the holidays, and I look fine as hell in a tshirt, flannel shirt, wool scarf, and winter jacket. My favorite ugly asf hat (seriously, it was a Jayne hat before Jayne was a thing) really pulls the outfit together, and I am happy as a clam!
I made a girly looking picrew just now. Starting to get excited about growing my hair out again.
Seriously looks great. Are they natural or did you get them done?
I write original LGBTQ themed pilot scripts it‚Äôs fun and helps me work out my thoughts
Thanks for reminding me that I used to write a lot.
But they‚Äôre very small things that make a big change in your life and perspective, no?
That‚Äôs fantastic!
That‚Äôs how they getcha! Let your gorgeous mane flow!- You get some of your power from it!
Go get ‚Äòem, Tiger!
Yes! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talkin‚Äô about.
That‚Äôs great! I remember my first water bra. So affirming.
Aww- Right on, Doc! That means they listen to you.
Doesn‚Äôt need to relate to anything but what‚Äôs making you happy right now. Now I have to check out Amphibia after looking it up. Sounds like fun! Ambiance is huge!
Thanks for saying so! What nail subs do you like? I‚Äôm of course in the middle of 3 books I just need to finish, so nail subs won‚Äôt be a distraction or anything, right?
Nice! Some clubs only require you be yourself.
Nice! The Kitchener stitch ain‚Äôt easy, Friend. None of my jobs ever produced anything tangible, I needed a hobby to make useful things. I‚Äôm picking up machine and hand-sewing. Mainly denim repair. Clothes are so much more than textiles.
I bet you look stunning (and cunning)! I‚Äôm happy for you.
Thanks for saying so! I let them grow a bit out of laziness, reasoning that my new job doesn‚Äôt require short nails, and all at once decided they needed to be shaped or chopped. So I watched some YouTube and bought the gear during a break. I achieved this result at my desk! I get a nice little buzz of dopamine every time I surprise myself doing normal tasks and seeing them attached to MY hand.
I'm working on a series of short stories all following one character in different sci-fi universes, with the point being that queerness can exist in those universes without it being all someone is even when some characters around the main character try to insist it should be.  Definitely a pretty fun experience and good for sorting through my thoughts.
That‚Äôs exciting! I used to write short stories with a sucker-punch at the end. Those were my favorites to write. I feel like television is the live-action graphic novel of short stories. Do you do it professionally?
It's never too late if you want to go back to it even in small doses, I've done it on-and-off since I was a kid and had a years-long break at one point and now I'm back to it.  There's also no shame in it being something you used to do and don't really want to do anymore.
It honestly was so wonderful. This particular office also has never given me the run around when it comes to actually treating my medical issues like some others do. It's been wonderful
I like to check out r/colorstreet and r/redditlaqueristas. Plenty of inspiration for future manis. And hey, sometimes, you need to take your mind off the written word and focus on done pretty colors and designs, right?
And dang, three books at once! It takes me a while to get through one book, haha. What's the book you're enjoying the most right now?
That‚Äôs way more fun that keeping a diary! Are you published?
No just as a hobby I enter them in amateur pilot contests and won one
So, goals: I love typing with nails. I‚Äôm taking free typing lessons online. When I get good, I think I‚Äôll take some time to write again.
Not yet, unless you count fanfics which...  I don't, not that way.  But someday I hope to be published, I know it probably won't end up being a massive success but it'd be pretty cool to say I'm a published author and for there to be queer sci-fi stories out there for others to enjoy thanks to me.
Congrats! That must‚Äôve felt incredible. Can we find it somewhere online? (If you‚Äôre interested in sharing)
Something that helped me and might help you; video games.  PC gaming can teach you where the keys are by heart and improve your reaction time, I play Fallout 4 and have taken to saying ""you don't have time to hunt and peck when a ghoul is ducking and weaving its way towards you"" or something along those lines, kind of a trial by fire but if you fail you can just go back and try again lol.  I think it's helped a lot with my typing and my typing (when I practice by writing) has in turn helped with my playing so it's a positive feedback loop.
Thanks. I like your style, human.

I wish the NB community would move away from the constant 'masc' 'femme' and 'androgynous' descriptors	"It just feels like Binary Gender 2.0/Gender Binary Lite‚Ñ¢. 

Let me tell you that when I found the descriptor ""virid"" (a ""neutral"" gender expression, NOT the same as andro, which is a mix of femme and masc. I'm talking totally unrelated to the gender binary. Think virid as green vs femme pink, masc blue, andro purple.) it totally and completely changed my perspective on gender expression. 

We're taught that dresses and long hair = women/feminine and pants and short hair = men/masculine. What I keep seeing is essentially NB people doing the opposite of what they were told to do for their AGAB in defiance of the gender binary in order to ""look"" nonbinary (can we talk about the concept of ""looking nonbinary""? What does that even mean? It shouldn't be a thing imo just as women and men should have more room for their respective genders). Which, I think a lot of the time can just replicate and reinforce traditional gender roles because we keep saying makeup is femme and short hair is masc. 

People are constantly asking on here ""Do I look androgynous"" ""Do I look nonbinary"" ""I feel like I'm not nonbinary enough"" ""Can nonbinary people do x"" etc. And I think this points to a lot of the confusion that especially questioning people have when they start exploring NB identity. AFAB people feel this pressure to cut off their long hair and get a pixie and AMAB people feel this pressure to wear makeup or grow out their hair or wear skirts, because ""That's what NB people do"".

And these are AWESOME things to do if you genuinely find joy in this! Gender euphoria is always an amazing thing to experience and everyone's idea of what they want to be, look like and feel is different. I know a lot of nonbinary people genuinely enjoy using masc/femme/Andro as descriptors or goals for themselves because it's what they like! And it's how they feel.

But I also think having this ONE, ubiquitous way of describing our looks with no alternatives is harmful sometimes-- I know it was for me, as an AFAB individual I ended up using my NB identity to justify my internalized sexism and thought I was ""basic"" and ""just a woman"" if I had long hair, so I cut mine off and held myself to these really unfair standards for years until I finally figured out what I ACTUALLY wanted to look like and not what I thought I should look like in order to be NB. Now I rock long hair because I just genuinely like it, and saw plenty of men and nonbinary people with long hair and different gender expressions rocking it too, and wear whatever the fuck I want, and I'm still NB.

Anyway, I like terms like virid, the Galactian gender system, and even the sexualities made specifically for NB people (trixic, toric, tiric) which help get rid of the ""do I call myself straight/gay/bi/etc."" issue. I think they help move away from the very binary-centered interpretation of physical appearance and internal feeling. The Galactian system can also sometimes feel like binary 2.0 in a way but at least it attempts to find new language and create new perspectives and interpretations on things we traditionally associate with binary genders. 

I'm a neutrois/agender person; wearing a dress and heels doesn't make me ""femme"" and wearing ripped up jeans, converse and a hoodie doesn't make me 'masc', because I'm not femme or masc-- I'm just a neutrois person wearing clothing that I like. 

I think this can be a difficult avenue to explore because almost all clothing and beauty practices in the world currently have historically been crafted and consumed within the context of men vs women, and even ""gender neutral"" clothing (in the west, usually mean's 'mens clothing'...) isn't necessarily without its associations. And I also understand that there's still use for using these terms for beauty practices we do bc we are still interpreted in a binary way by binary people and that affects our lives in similar ways according to what binary side you might be associated with.

Even when I say I'm looking positively virid to others that might just be, in their minds, masc or femme and they might not know what I mean when I say that because it could mean anything in this case. But I think using alternative language for people who want to do so would be a step in the right direction to give people even more freedom to look or feel how they want.

I look forward to the ways the NB community can continue to break norms and not just in the ""do the opposite of what I've been told to do thereby reinforcing the original system"" but ACTUALLY bringing in new perspectives and crafting new areas of aesthetics that can broaden the aesthetic world into places we've never been before.

Sorry if this came off as ""old man shakes fist at cloud + doesn't offer many solutions"" but I just wanted to vent and see what other people thought. I've just felt a bit alienated particularly from the nonbinary community as of late. Thanks for reading this far!

Edit: I think people are repeatedly misinterpreting my post as saying ""We should abolish the use of femme/andro/masc completely"". That's not what I'm saying. My point is that I wish it weren't the overwhelming majority of the language used in NB spaces at the expense of potential conversations about alternative language for NBs who don't identify with the binary at all."	"I get what you mean, often people (even within the community) talk about nb people as basically two quasi-binary genders where one is ""FTM lite"" and the other is ""MTF lite"". There should definitely be space to make up your own signifiers that aren't based on masc or femme at all.
I do agree with you and I wish it would be a realistic possibility. For me there's more to it though. I'm afab non binary and everywhere I go, I get constantly called ""she"". I fucking hate it. Aside from the fact that my native language doesn't have any neutral pronouns, the only thing that helps me a little in social spaces, is to present myself as masc as possible. Might change after I transioned, might not. What I'm getting at is, that the world we live in, is dominated by the binary system. I don't want to perceived as a girl. Although I'm not a boy, it feels better for me, if people think I'm a boy. Ideally they would respect and recognise me as non binary, but that's not gonna happen with strangers. I think some might feel similar. In order to be perceived in a way that doesn't cause gender dysphoria, I and maybe also other comply to the binary system in our own way.
I dunno like I get what you're saying and agree to the extent that we obviously need to have better vocabulary. But also, I don't think that non-binary means totally unrelated to masc and fem. There's a continuum between the two and it's still useful to use these terms to describe our position along that axis even if it isn't at the binary endpoints.
>I look forward to the ways the NB community can continue to break norms and not just in the ""do the opposite of what I've been told to do thereby reinforcing the original system"" but ACTUALLY bringing in new perspectives and crafting new areas of aesthetics that can broaden the aesthetic world into places we've never been before.

The only way to do this is to design your own clothes and define your own style. Submit designs to actual lgbtq+ positive fashion companies. Start an Instagram or hash tag. Spread designs and spread the word that this is an untapped market and people will try. Sometimes when there isn't something out there you just have to go for it and be open to criticism but still know not everything will suit everyone's style. I'm also agender/neutrois and have been trying to form my own style that completely envelopes me in euphoria. It's slow and will take some time, especially since I have a few medical transition goals. 

I understand it can be a nightmare to sew or tackle things like this but it's SO worth it. What I did to start was make a hidden pinterest board of all the things that gave me euphoria, makeup, clothes, styles, mood boards, bedrooms, anything. Even if it was ""close"" but not perfect I threw it on there. Then I started trying to play with those things in my own style and see what actually felt right on me. If I try something out and end up hating it, I take it off the board. If I try something and it's close, I alter it until I like it. Im not the greatest seamstr/ess so I have my limits currently, though I plan to keep pushing into this and will hopefully come up with some decent designs that others can adapt for themselves.

Final thoughts: It's uncharted territory, which can be both exciting and intimidating. I personally am thrilled to see what kind of stuff we can come up with if we really try!
I really feel this! Even though im comfortable using femme/masc/andro to describe my expression or gender, sometimes it just doesnt feel like it enough or that its quite accurate, and i also have found myself projecting those labels onto others in my mind. I try hard to separate the concepts of gender expression as a trans/queer person from what society has taught me, but i definitely still find myself thinking in a very binary or binary 2.0 way. I really appreciate your post on this, i dont have many thoughts myself to offer but its definitely making me think some and i feel the need to look into virid and other terms of expression that dont rely on the binary system as a comparison. Thanks! :)
I don‚Äôt mind using words like femme, masc or andro when talking about exploring your gender presentation because is simply easier when you talk about something so abstract, to me it wouldn‚Äôt be useful to get rid of those words. My main issue is how people use or perceive certain terms, I still believe that something being masculine or feminine is extremely subjective. Most stuff traditionally associated with femininity can‚Äôt be seen as neutral by most people and that bothers me a lot, to me my gender presentation is androgynous because that‚Äôs how I choose to see myself. Ugh, I feel like I‚Äôm over the place trying to explain what I want to say, but like you said, I wish people move on from the idea that non-binary is a third gender with more stupid norms. I just want to chill out in a field full of flowers with my titties out and stop seeing posts policing how being non-binary should look like.
I understand your perspective, but don‚Äôt personally 100% agree. I think it‚Äôs valid to prefer the non ‚Äúmasc/femme‚Äù gender language, but that is not going to be every non binary persons experience. I think you see a lot of NB people talking about gender and gender expression using more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù language because many non-binary people do not identify as completely separate from those terms. It‚Äôs valid to identify as non-binary and identify with terms like ‚Äúmasculine and feminine‚Äù to different extents or not at all.

Just because your personal experience as a non-binary person is more toward neutrois doesn‚Äôt mean that other people have that same experience, and that‚Äôs going to be reflected in the language this community uses. I understand your feelings, but this does feel like a perspective that does not take into account a good chunk of the non-binary community‚Äôs experiences. 

Tldr: I think it‚Äôs valid to prefer agender/gender neutral language, but also important to recognize that not all non-binary people identify as completely separate from masculinity/femininity/gendered language.
I think we need to stop asking what we need to be non binary and start saying ‚Äúthis is me and I‚Äôm non binary‚Äù
like what would mtf have to be femme or ftm masc? what if they like dressing not taht way but are transitioning? Like is osmoene femme masc if they alternate styles?
It would be great to have words for all kinds of gender expressions! I'm personally femme and feel quite connected to that word and don't feel like to me it's ""woman enby"" implying, but completely understand how others don't like terms like masc and femme and andro for themselves. 
For me, it's all about how we tend to view femme VS masc on a sliding scale rather than pinpoints on a constellation of different gender expressions. That's no different than the male VS female binary. 
Femme is more than 'cis people think you're a woman or want to be a woman' so I try not to let cis people change how I see myself. We are infinite üòä
For me personally masculine and feminine are just descriptive words to what we can see, just as tall, petite, etc
These words are not related to gender but they exist which makes it easy to use. I know we need new words but it's hard to just implement them into language because it's not how language works.
We can push them, but if they are actually used in the future is another thing. 
I think it would be easier to get rid of the connection between masculine/feminine and man/woman than to invent new words that only the lgbt community knows about. Because in the end we are part of society and this is how society works.
Atleast that's how i see it.

We just need to teach the world that nothing that exist is binary and that everything that can't be put into boxes.
While I did cut my hair short it's because I wanted to. I got it before I realized I was non-binary and fell in love with the short hair, it was also a way of dealing with trauma, and decided to keep it that way. I do use the terms because I'm comfortable with it for myself. I appear extremely girly but I am fine with that I wear what I want. I just wear whatever I'm comfortable with that day. Some days I don't want to wear a dress and some days I do. I am just being who I am without holding back.
I agree with most of this but masc and fem is useful for a lot of people. Like I'm ftm as in f to masc. I'm nb but lean heavily towards male. For people who do lean towards the binary they are useful but yeah having better words for certain situations would be better
My gender is: tired and just trying to be true to myself as much as possible. üëç
I'm me. Non-binary, dress how I please but the NB is how I feel inside. It fits how I feel like a glove. I don't like pigeonholes and too many descriptors confuse me.  Does it really validate how you feel about yourself to squeeze into very tiny multiple pigeonholes? Probably, for some people who haven't found quite where they fit but for me, NB is awesome and nothing more is needed.  It covers a very broad spectrum!

For me, it's how I feel inside that is more important that the clothes I wear.
yeah, I‚Äôve always been green ;) i don‚Äôt try to explain it to people if they don‚Äôt want to know ‚Äî far too great a leap for most people, unfortunately üëΩ
To u/washa30786 , I can see your comment in my emails but for the life of me cannot find it to reply to on this post lol maybe it's a mobile issue. So I'm replying this way. Hopefully it's actually on here and it's just a me problem! 

I would disagree that nonbinary exists because of the binary, at least not in its entirety. I think for us westerners here and most of the English speaking nonbinary community, that IS the case because the binary has been part of European cultures for a long time, but historically there have been cultures with ""nonbinary"", third gender or otherwise, in our definition, gender non conforming genders, and these are good examples of genders that come from a different perspective and are a different ""flavor"" than many western NB identities that emerged recently because the gender binary wasn't necessarily as much of a thing for them. Even people from other countries like Japan or Spain (random countries off the top of my head that I know have NB communities) might now have different terms or feelings about NB simply due to language difference. So, not every NB identity might have necessarily been precluded by a binary. Nowadays, many have though.

Yeah, as other people have made me realize, I am neglecting a bit the NB who genuinely need these descriptors because it DOES fit them. 

Haha, yeah I totally agree with you on the absolute finickyness and subjectivity of using gendered descriptors only for people to disagree and interpret differently. I think this is just something that each person will have to decide how they want to handle these-- it's kind of the same as how a trans woman might feel like a woman, in her eyes look like a woman, BE a woman, but a transphobic cis man would disagree because his interpretation doesn't match. Doesn't mean saying she's a woman isn't accurate or isn't useful. People will interpret how they want but it's up to YOU to decide how you want to navigate the world. 

I think you posting a selfie but making your gender identity clear would only backfire simply BECAUSE people have these associations for what femme and masc might mean even in the NB community, tho tbh people who post on the NB subreddit and don't """"""""do the NB costuming"""""""" ie don't go out of their way to dress against what society might like of them, they're still accepted warmly and gendered correctly (ex, ""Even tho I'm femme I'm still a them""), tho how each person might see them inside silently might be very individual. I actually think making your identity clear can give a nice cue for others to determine what compliments or gendered language to use for you, such as the determinations you used just when reading my post.

And this is where I think whether or not to keep your identity to yourself is a personal thing. For me personally, I just don't talk about it unless asked 90% of the time in public. Drs appts, grocery store, job, etc. My gender is beyond them, so to speak lol. If someone outright says ""You're a girl"" due to a line of convo or something, I will at that point correct them because it's just wrong. Pronouns are less of a deal for unimportant strangers who dont know my pronouns tho bc like... Who has the energy. Lmao. Only people I work with who I think would be supportive, and close friends and family. 

Thanks for commenting, I like talking about this kind of thing! Lol
I see you. I personally get stuck in a weird place, and I think a lot of other people do to, of things I do because I want to and things I do out of dysphoria. No most people aren‚Äôt going to understand my gender and treat me appropriately- but that hurts me so if I try I can atleast make it so I am treated like my agab less often. I think too I have different sets of language- for cis ppl I‚Äôm just meeting, for binary trans people, for other non-binary people- I describe myself in different ways and they are all true but they all serve to describe myself to the listener. I don‚Äôt need to describe myself to me- I just am, and using words to myself doesn‚Äôt make me see myself more clearly.

Idk- so I‚Äôm non-binary, asexual, biromantic (attracted to two or more genders) and transmasc. But I‚Äôm mostly a lot of things words don‚Äôt capture. I look pretty neutral, some people could see me as masc or androgynous- but I just want to look and feel neutral. ü§∑
Could you expand on the Galactian system? I found a description online, but it seems basically the same as the normal gender binary, except that 'female' is named for the moon and 'male' named for the sun (maybe its just the specific Wikis I found?). Is virid similar?
I appreciate this post. First of all, I learned some new words. That's always a blessing. Second, I feel like I'm always trying to justify to people that I'm nonbinary because they consider my presentation femme and I am AFAB. I don't feel things considered generally femme have to be considered that forever in society. I'm more comfortable in tighter clothing. I like makeup because it makes it so you can see my eyebrows and eyelashes because I'm blonde not because it makes me look for feminine. There just doesn't always seem to be room for me in this community based on the things you pointed out in your post, but I'm hopeful when I see posts from people like me. It helps to see everyone from every corner of the community. Third, I don't think gender is a spectrum from femme to masc because we don't have to be limited to think of gender just in terms of those things. What about intersex people? They're not broken versions of the other genders - they can be a gender in themselves and that is more how I feel and what I want to emulate in my behavior (less my appearance and more in the ways I interact with the world like my personality). Does that make sense? Loved the post once again, thank you for the learning.
omg thank you for this, I always wear clothes I like and I'm confortable in and I'm tired to hear people say I dress like a woman just because I wear a skirt, I feel amazing in my skirt doesn't mean I'm feminine and not non binary anymore, I didnt leave to binary box to be put in another box!
I absolutely love your thoughts on this! I think I feel similarly to you in regards to having distinct language for my experience that doesn't center binary understandings of expression. Like i just want to express myself and explore expressions that I was not allowed to experience due to the restrictive norms imposed upon me at birth. I think its perfectly valid to articulate your experience using the 'traditional' ways of describing expression (masc, femme, andro) and still recognize your own connection as being distinct from the nominal association to them. Just like if a nonbinary person uses binary pronouns it doesn't mean that they carry the conventional association to these things. I personally believe that someone can completely not relate to the binary and still use the 'traditional' language to describe expression but I do think it's also important to expand our understanding and allow people to have a more intentional and potentially accurate way of reflecting their expressions and identity. 

It's things like this that give me hope and remind me of how much beauty there is in finding intentional ways to reflect your being. I love this community ‚ù§Ô∏è
My pet peeve is that the community has taken up saying andro as short for androgynous when it means man because the word is a mashup of the binary. Really gets my goat.

You‚Äôre far from alone, I generally abhor pinning myself and others down on some gradient of man to woman. But some nonbinary people aren‚Äôt as distant from the binary as others. And there‚Äôs no hierarchy of ‚Äúwhose experience is more right?‚Äù There are a massive amount of nonbinary people for whom these labels do provide useful description of their goals and desires.

It can feel awkward when that‚Äôs not you, and confirmation bias + the nature of Reddit provides you with ammo to feel drowned in this terminology, but other people using these words doesn‚Äôt say anything about you and what you ‚Äòshould‚Äô want, because nonbinary is defined by what it‚Äôs not, and you can be incredibly different from 5 other nonbinary folks in the same room. Most nonbinary people understand not to push masc/fem/androgynous labels and descriptors onto others, or they do after a quick discussion of why not to.

There‚Äôs another thing at play here, and that‚Äôs the bias of this sub towards people at the very beginning of their journey. When I was first figuring this shit out I had ‚Äúgirl days‚Äù and ‚Äúboy days‚Äù because I didn‚Äôt know how to be my neither self yet. When first expanding past the binary, most people still need it as guardrails and guideposts to begin flexing outside their norm and find what‚Äôs better.
This is an interesting discussion because, as I understand it, the very reason why non-binary exists is *because* of the binary. The very reason why I identify as enby is *because* I feel like a mix of boy and girl. For example, if I had to do a somewhat mathematical proof of my gender to someone, I could not do so without using ""feeling like a boy"" and ""feeling like a girl"" or derivatives of those concepts. These are the basic building blocks on which my gender identity is built. And that *is* stupid in a sense, because the very concepts of ""feeling like a boy"" or ""feeling like a girl"" are themelves built upon the very stereotypes I would like to see destroyed in the first place. The problem is that, at least right now, I do need them. It *does* make sense to me to see at least some of my clothes as ""girl clothes"" and others as more boyish or neutral. Similarly, I would assume the very reason why you identify as neutrois is *because* you *don't* feel either like a boy or a girl. The very reason why we are here is because we had to formulate our gender identity in terms of the binary, because this is how we've been raised. You settled for ""neither"" while I settled for ""both"". The fact that it bothers you that people might think of you using gendered terms seems to me like just another pointer towards the fact that you identify with a neutral gender so it makes sense for you to somewhat ""reject"" those terms altogether. That being said, they definitely are useful in my opinion, especially for new enby who still need to refer to the binary because this is all new to them and the binary is the only way they know to perceive the world, at least for now.

That being said, there is something very alluring in being able to talk about gender and gender expression without having to refer to the original binary terms. Being able to say something that basically means ""I'm cute like a girl‚Ñ¢"" but without ever using a truly gendered term. I think that would be freeing to some extent, but obviously you would lose the ability to talk with people who are unaware of those new words. I mean, you could always revert to the gendered version but that kind of defeats the purpose.

Actually, what I've seen being done here a lot, and I really like it, is saying things like ""I feel very gender"". To be honest I don't know what that means for sure, but I interpreted as ""I don't really know where I stand on the gender spectrum and I don't care, this style suits me and I feel happy"" and I *love* this approach. I prefer it to the galactian system or any other new words system because, ultimately, gender perception is not universal. For example, some things that I see as ""girly"" or let's say ""female-leaning"", or ""lunarian"", my wife would disagree and say that for her those things are perfectly neutral. Or, the opposite, I do have some clothes that are litteraly labeled as ""men"" that my wife considers to be ""female-leaning"". So this would be a more interesting approach in my opinion: just forgo those concepts altogether. It doesn't help that much to label yourself as ""femme"" or ""lunarian"" or whatever, because people will interpret your gender using their *own* prism anyway. If you say ""I'm lunarian"" and people don't see enough ""lunarianeness"" in your gender expression then it could quickly evolve in an awkward situation, while actually it shouldn't even matter. We are all valid as it is, no matter what label we use, so basically the label serves no purpose outside of our own mind. Therefore, I'd suggest maybe to keep the label to yourself ? For example, if I was to post a selfie of myself right now, while I feel like I'm mixing both feminine and masculine clothings, I'm sure most people would also see a guy with a skinny jean. So basically the label would not help anything and could only backfire in this particular case. I don't think this community would blame anyone for not really physically matching the label we put on ourselves but the point is that the label is useless outside of our own mind. We're all very gender anyway and it's awesome.
We have similar feelings. I want to create a mind eraser where we would forget all of the social programming that has been jammed inside of us and start from neutral. Have it where regardless of anything (e.g., AGAB, the way society thinks you look or should act/dress) you have access and ability to do whatever you want with your body as it seems fit and right to you. I would love if a piece of clothing was just that - clothing. Something you put on your body that doesn‚Äôt have a gender. Because why the fuck did clothing become gender?! 

I can understand why some others in this subreddit want to go the opposite of their AGAB because they are also feeling external pressure, as well as internal, to fit what society still expects of them. It‚Äôs hard to push off doubts when you are presenting close to your AGAB and are constantly being misgendered and thus experiencing gender dysphoria. Sometimes extremes might seem like the only choice. Who knows. I just try to respect their decisions and know it‚Äôs not mine and that‚Äôs fine. I will continue to work in my way, in my space for now and maybe leading by example (e.g., confidence in who I am regardless of what society wants me to be based on what I wear) will help someone who is struggling.
And that's why I'm transneutral and neutrois!
Everything is just another binary system to shove us into. People can't help but think in terms of binary systems. Male/female masc/femme. Even binary/non-binary is a damned binary system. It's one easy way for humans to categorize things. We won't escape it until we can release our need for labels & categories. There will always be boxes to be shoved into and labels and people who don't fit them and make new ones and then someone else doesn't fit those and makes their own. So why don't we just stop? Idk. Why think of gender as pink, blue, purple, and green? Why not a gender void. Just nothingness. 

Sorry I'm just rambling.
Finally someone else who I gets it! OMG. I also feel like agender/neutrois is a good descriptor for me.
Yes! I will say I didn‚Äôt read the second half, readings is hard for me, but I really get the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm AGAB, so I can‚Äôt do this thing I wanted to do because it‚Äôs associated with that gender‚Äù  stuff. I‚Äôm afab, and I like wearing makeup, but I‚Äôve always thought that o shouldn‚Äôt because associations and everything, or I wouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúmasc‚Äù enough
Ugh, yes exactly üò©
Honestly, I get it. I used to say I'd rather be called a boy and have male descriptors used than female because at least I'm not being called a woman. I haven't considered it from the perspective of people who use other languages though-- I likely have privilege of complaining here because the English language has room for it where other languages might not. Because of that room, I've had the ability to discover that honestly, I don't like being called a boy anymore either, because I had space to come to terms with separating my body and other people's perceptions from what I see as my actual reality. Almost as if I'm, y'know, nonbinary! Lmao and not binary, make or female.   
But yeah. Like I mentioned, I don't think masc/femme/andro needs to be gotten rid of entirely, but I just have this giant suspicion that a lot of NBs might also be using those just because again, there's no other alternatives they know of, and it would be nice to see otherwise. In the English language at least :( That doesn't go for people who are CONSCIOUSLY using these because they honest to god like it and made the decision to do so in the face of alternatives. I'm glad you have that safe spot to fall back onto it when it comes to a masc identity or presentation!
Yeah, that's fair. I'm coming at this from the perspective of a neutrois person like I mentioned, and have felt alienated by the continued ubiquity of binary influence on nonbinary communities, but yes there's probably quite a large, if not majority population of the NB community who have connection to masc/fem in some way or another so it's still relative to them.

I think the thing that bothers me the most is that because of the limited language that we have, I get the feeling if I posted selfies here for instance, other NB people would still be interpreting my appearance in terms of masc/femme which is like... I can't escape it! Lol and additionally, just the thought (and evidence that this is happening just from all the posts I see) of newcomers thinking that this is ALL that nonbinary is bc it's the majority of what they see.

Perhaps I'm prioritizing my own perspective here over the perspectives of others. Either way, I do still think more diverse language is needed and I'd like to see more circles where these things aren't the case. There's r/agender but it's still such a small community and isn't quite the same as other NB circles.
Holy crap, that's so awesome! I have so much admiration for people in creative spheres, especially those who work with clothing because it's never been an area I felt confident in unlike with painting or drawing. I love to hear that! 

I think honestly that's one of the biggest ways to go too, right now the NB community is still in its infancy and this was one of things I can't wait to see from people because it can change the way we see fashion. I personally hate altering clothes/sewing/etc unless it's literally painting on fabric üò© I wish I didnt otherwise I probably would do cool stuff like this and would have less of a hassle just altering my clothes in general! Lmfao
Hey, no problem, and glad to provoke some thought! Tbh there aren't many more descriptors that I know of which has been disheartening, unless you want to count the Galactian descriptors (solarian, lunarian, etc.) But not many people know of that and I suspect many might not like it as it might not be universally relatable + the ""binary roles dressed up in different clothes"" criticism. Hopefully you can find more than I can or maybe eventually people will start coming up with more!
Hell yea babie B)
Yeah, that's fair! I can understand that viewpoint, not everyone will see themselves reflected in this.
Femme or masc can be whatever that means to them. My point here is for NB people to not also feel like they have to use these descriptors when that might not necessarily be their experience. I'm not advocating for people to get rid of femme/masc entirely, just to allow more room for people to use other things if they want and to increase awareness of the alternatives.
üòÑ
My qualm is specifically with the nonbinary community, and not the world population as a whole. NB have adopted plenty of words that we generally only use with each other. That's more my area of concern. That's much more approachable than trying to change English diction on the whole which is not my aim here lol.

I think masc and femme are currently still very tied in with notions of gender. It's how a lot of trans people gauge how well they ""pass"" as their gender.
Hey, that's awesome to hear! I'm glad you found yourself.
My clothes and looks are all figured out and represent me fine. It's being called masc, femme or andro that bothers me because it doesn't suit me at all and it's not true, I'm not those things. It's like being misgendered almost. I almost don't even like being called nonbinary. Lol
Honestly, literally same lmfao
Yeah I used to have plenty of weird display issues on mobile too at some point.

I don't have an extensive knowledge of non-binary genders in other cultures so you might very well be right on that one. I have seen the indian ""two-spirits"" gender been thrown around a lot as a proof that non-binary genders has simply been erased by western society but is nevertheless valid. However, the name itself ""two-spirits"" implies that even then they already had a binary understanding of genders, it just happens that they already got a word to define the people who were outside of this binary way before we did, and that it was a valid accepted gender in their otherwise binary society. That being said, I do not know anything about the history of that particular gender or about any other non-binary gender term in any other language so, again, you might very well be right on that one.

I agree that making your identity clear is useful. I should add some label with ""they/them"" to my account now that I think about it, as I've seen a lot of people do. However, I don't think self-describing your gender expression is that useful. I mean, you don't need to write ""Even tho I'm femme I'm still a them"", because the picture already conveys at least part of your gender expression, and the information about your gender identity can come from somewhere else, like the user labels for example. Gender identity cannot reliably be inferred from gender expression anyway.

Actually, now that I re-read your reply, I feel like you might mean when people use words like ""femme"" or ""masc"" to describe their gender identity ? I don't have a clear understanding of those term when they apply to gender identity rather than gender expression. I have heard of some people labeling themselves ""transmasc"" and ""transfemme"" and I'm not sure I understand what that means. Is it like ""non-binary with a predominently masc/femme gender expression"" ? But then why mix your gender expression with your gender identity ? Or is it like ""non-binary with a predominently masculine or feminine gender identity"" ? But then isn't this very similar to ""demiboy""/""demiman"" and ""demigirl""/""demiwoman"" ? I'm sure it makes sense to the people who use those terms and they are as valid as any other gender. I'm simply genuinely wondering what people truly mean when they use those terms in that particular context.
https://the-mogai-community.fandom.com/wiki/Galactian_Alignment_System

Not sure if you saw that or not. Yeah, it's a redressing   in a way of the binary descriptors, it's specifically a way of saying masc or femme without saying masc or femme, adding a NB spin on it, and adding a whole lot more than that as you'll see if you look at the graphs/list of identities under the system. Kind of in the same way (might be a bad example but not sure how else to put it) that, say, outsiders might interpret fa'afafine and hijra both as ""third gender"" but the flavors are distinctly different because they have different cultural contexts, and are not the same thing, even though they're both often categorized as ""third gender"". Femme and lunarian can be similar or different, just depends one the individual using it.

I still don't think it's a perfect system though bc of the redressing issue. But I do like that it attempts to broach the issue. Honestly, until femme and masc get broadened in our wider culture over time, this language issue might persist because the underlying systemic framework isn't changing with our language. :(

Virid isn't related to the Galactian system, no. It's kind of its own thing lol.
Yeah it makes sense! Glad to provide more sense of community for you :)
üòä
Yeah no, everything you've said here is totally right! And is a very fair point lol. Thank you for adding that.
Yeah, I understand people going the opposite too because I literally did it too. I guess from my perspective as someone who came out the other side and saw it for what it was, I'm probably judging too harshly because you kind of just have to make the mistakes before learning from it, lol at least from the people who that kind of thing it ISN'T right for.

I agree with p much everything you said haha.
My goal would be to think like you about people's perceptions; I get you point and I wish I could be like that, but maybe it's possible for me after the mastectomy. Things seem to change after one is freed from crippling dysphoria^^
As a gender fluid person, i live my identity through masc and femme. Its a unique experience for everyone. I honestly dont see the need to stray away from masc or femme because those are two things that help us define our gender identity in the first place! Just because we are non binary doesnt mean we have to do away with the two ends of the spectrum . Some days im a woman some days im a man some days im both ü§∑ not sure how it would be described without the use of the two idenities
And what does Solarian/Lunarian mean? Is it just masc and femme respectively, without saying masc and femme? What system does it use? There's multiple old faiths where the moon is male and sun female, including my own, while in others it's the reverse. So would I have to go against my personal beliefs in order to use this galactic system?
Ive definitely heard of galactian because i was looking up a bunch of pride flags and labels and i really liked a lot of the celestarian system genders, sexualities, etc. Galactian was probably linked/recommended but i didnt super look into it at the time, and i haven't heard the term virid before or many other galactian terms to my knowledge. Im definitely gunna have some fun researching more on these and maybe ill find more i identify with!
I hope you have a great day üòä
I was glad too. It took well over a year of questioning myself and growing to accept that. I'm glad you found yourself too.
Yeah, I get where you're coming from. I guess I made my point badly - basically that I don't find MASC/femme etc helpful at all. I do like NB however as it covers a massive amount of different scenarios:)
Nah, I meant when people say ""Having a masc day"" or ""I love looking femme"" or ""What are femme things I can wear"" or ""Am I nonbinary if I dress masculine"" etc. 

Not trashing these people for saying these things and being honest about how they feel, that would be stupid, and some things are kind of hard to NOT say like that bc in order for a language to be effective, everyone has to know what the words mean (like asking for femme clothes communicates an idea quickly and will probably get what the poster wants, probably isn't the time to use non gendered language or it would be confusing.). My gripe was how that seems to be the only lens a lot of NB people see gender expression for everyone, that everyone has to use these labels bc nothing else exists and that a lot of people just seem to think being NB is being either a third gender in between boy or girl (androgyne essentially) or boy/girl lite. For many people that might be true but there's almost this blindness to agender people's perspectives, for instance, and I think ONLY having fem/andro/masc as descriptors in the NB community and almost nothing else is almost odd for how much many of us want to ""smash the binary"" and for such a unique, diverse bunch lol. 

Transmasc/transfemme generally indicates people who feel somewhat attached to male/female concepts but not necessarily in the way a man or woman would be, or yes, kind of just fits gender expression in there because that pointer I made about language having to be widely known to be effective. Like, I can be agender but call myself transmasc if I'm taking testosterone  for indtance. For some, demiboy or demigirl can fit and that can include them also, but for others the feelings are more nebulous, they might not like the name or description or otherwise just might not like being specific or care, it's an easy way of tipping someone off to their general identity.
Thanks for that description! It's really helpful. Yup, that's the site I saw.

I think it's a fantastic idea to develop a gender system that avoids thinking in terms of masc/femme, but it's really hard to implement in a way that doesn't reinforce existing binary stereotypes. 

A lot of it could be unconscious associations - like, with the sun/moon thing in the galactic system, I guess the idea was that the creators were thinking of interchangeable star signs. But it makes me a bit uncomfortable to say that ""masculine"" is this giant powerful source of light that rules the entire solar system, while ""feminine"" is this tiny rock that helplessly revolves around the sun because its influence is so strong.

I guess someone could try developing a gender system that is based on self-perception, personal traits, and self-presentation, but again, there's a big risk that they would still have masc/femm associations, and could come across as even more restrictive than the traditional binary.

 I guess one advantage of the masc/femm binary is that although they do have their rigid stereotypes they have changed so much over the centuries and have basically always been challenged, so there are so many flexible models of masculinity/feminity to follow.
Right, totally get it. It‚Äôs a hill we don‚Äôt have to die on because people need to grow and learn on their own. We can‚Äôt even change peoples minds. Can you imagine where you were, trying out the far far side of the ‚Äúgender spectrum‚Äù, and someone tried to convince you otherwise? You might have resisted and gone further down a path that you (much) later found out was not for you. 

It‚Äôs a painful journey for all of us, and you and I as well as some others, are fortunate enough to come out the other end with our true selves intact. But I think as creatures we are always altering ourselves through change and growth and I can never say I won‚Äôt go to an extreme again. I think it might be less likely as I am very happy with who I am, but I can‚Äôt ever count it out.
That's another perspective I haven't considered! The only times I feel dysphoria now are in social situations and when I did feel dysphoria with my body, it was actually self-induced because of what I was talking about above-- the pressure to look more masculine in order to be a ""true"" NB if you're AFAB. I considered testosterone because I wanted to ""erase"" my current body but I'm glad I didn't go through with it, because it wasn't a nonbinary issue, it was a sexism issue. 

I hope you can get relief from that burden after having time with your new physical form :) Having crippling dysphoria I'm sure just makes everything that much more complicated and I can understand that it might necessitate more black and white thinking for people, and so I might have a different perspective here than others. Thanks for mentioning that!
I can't say whether it's something that would go against your faith or not, I think that's something you personally would have to decide.

Yay! :)

Yes! Lol 

I do disagree with that interpretation of sun vs moon. Not everything has to be about size or strength, and you don't have to take it literally a la the actual scientific properties of our celestial bodies lol. It can just be more the IDEA of the two. I mean hell, your lunarian could be the moon that eclipses the sun, or the blood moon. Your sun could be a dying star or the sun at dusk. Etc. Lol
And I thank you for your nice words. It's great to know there are awesome people like you in the world. I really appreciate conversation like this - no fighting over arguments, just exchanging point of views in a nice, civil way and enrichen each other's thoughts.
Maybe changing our expectations to be acknowledged for who we are and how we feel by everyone is the key?

A coworker apparently had a ton of beauty procedures done (less than me but mine are subtle and invisible). And I noticed how she struggles with being shamed for it. So I showed her some scars on my nose (was part of ffs) and she opened up with about even her multiple BA and we connected about that topic. 

My point is she is cis but also has to deal with not being accepted by everyone. Maybe its a mistake to want that as it makes me uncomfortable and unhappy, and focus on those who are supporting.
That's my point though. You've said you want everyone to move to that system, as opposed to just you, but that system doesn't fit everyone. It would mean that I, a distinctly not male, more female but still not - hence femme, not female - would have to use an effectively male gender designation. Having to use this system would effectively be me having to give myself dysphoria, and dead gender myself, every time I discussed my gender. I'm less worried about it going against my faith and more worried about it going against my mental health. 

I don't have a problem with a different designation system, though I can't think of any way of them being any better than our current one. They'd have to be very abstract which has its own problems, or stereotypical which has its own worse problems. I think femme/masc/andro are good because it refers to presentation, I understand while disagreeing with your issues, but I genuinely can't think of a better alternative.
This system is interesting thanks for sharing the link
Aww, thanks, and likewise. Yeah that shit's rare on Reddit sometimes lmao.
That's awful! I've also looked at having beauty procedures done but the judgement from other people is insane, particularly for women. You're only worth kindness, admiration and respect as a woman or femme if you're hot but if it's not effortless then you're high maintenance, vain, selfish and mentally ill. That's sad to hear.
I'm a bit confused. A male gender designation? What do you mean?
Yes, I got a lot of close people scared about me and my mental health when I decided to have FFS. Including some trans people. 

Then after it they where extremely relived I still look like me and not like a instagram model or something‚Ä¶ it was all about them and their judgments.

Edit: The way I see it is that makeup or surgery will not change your insecurities. But it definitely changes how others view you. Like everyone has  perfect teeth these days‚Ä¶ in the 60s you would see people who had natural teeth on film and tv.

If you want something done just get it and ignore the haters as they are just envious you took control of your life.
The moon is male in my beliefs (and many other old beliefs), but based on the link you provided, a femme enby would be lunarian. So I have to be a moon person, but the moon is male with my beliefs, so if I designate myself a moon person, I'm saying I'm a male person.
For sure.
Ohh, I see. Sorry, I thought I was looking at a different comment line so lost the context of this convo.

Never anywhere did I say I wanted people to move en masse to the Galactian system, or really even as a solution to this problem. I personally have my own issues with it which I've stated before (lack of relatability [as your case kind of could be construed as] plus references and reskins to [western] binary concepts). I've been using it as an example of a system that is attempting to address the issue that I've brought up here, and to therefore show that it is possible, either as a current potentiality or a future one that would necessitate further development of the NB community + cis people's education on these kinds of things. Again, not as a solution because it is not haha!
Oh, and as for your point about a ""replacing"" system instead of femme/andro/masc and the issues with finding a suitable one, yeah I agree with that. My focus wasn't on, again, getting rid of those terms (title of my post relies on the presence of the word ""constant"" there lol) but adding more language (hence my focus on 'virid' as an example) and increasing awareness of alternative methods of descriptions. And yeah, the issues you mentioned are an obstacle. I'm not claiming to sit here and have the solutions since this was just a rant + I'm not really an ideas person, I wanted to start a conversation about this phenomenon so that hopefully more people can think about it and hopefully, with more conversations like this, the community as a whole can decide what it wants to do, what direction to go in and hopefully that will include more people like me who don't feel attachment to the concepts discussed here."	tlxkfz	NonBinary	252	0.96	2022-03-24 04:24:14

Enbies in academia	"I had a joyful experience yesterday that I wanted to share with y‚Äôall üíú

I‚Äôm a PhD student in a field where it‚Äôs a bit less common to see queer people (that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll say for privacy reasons). My school is having a conference this weekend, where graduate students and professors around the state are invited to present their research and discuss it together. I‚Äôm one of the presenters, which is amazing in itself :)

But the biggest joy and surprise was seeing a human who was So Very Gender walk into the room and make a name tag that included they/them pronouns! I wasn‚Äôt expecting any other queer people at all, let alone another nonbinary person! It brought me so much delight to see a much older and fully out enby being accepted and respected in my field üíúüíú thought y‚Äôall might appreciate it too"	"I have only ever met another nonbinary person in my field,  but once a student emailed me saying that seeing me be open about myself was in part what gave them the courage to come out as nonbinary and that was the most heartwarming experience. Visibility is important!
That‚Äôs fantastic!!! I work in a more ‚Äúliberal‚Äù STEM field (biology), so it‚Äôs not uncommon to meet queer people in general, but I‚Äôve never come across any openly trans or non-binary people which definitely feels a bit isolating.
Seven years ago, I think I only knew of one (1) openly trans or enby person in my subfield.  And that was someone who had left academia in part because of transphobia.  Today it would be at least a dozen, including me.  And our professional organization recently formed a DEI Caucus that will have a trans and nonbinary committee.  Once or twice someone has told me that they had the courage to come out professionally because I did. üíúüíú

Hell yeah! I've taken an ecology class where there were more nonbinary ppl than men and probably not queer ppl than straight people, and while ecology is probably an outlier, I do know anther nonbinary person in the school of engineering at my university :)
We're changing this slowly!
Check out 500 Queer Scientists! It lets you filter by field. :)
Non-binary/transfemme academic here. We are rare but we do exist. I‚Äôve had a number of students state that having a visibly Hella Queer instructor created a safe space (if only for that one class) for them to express themselves fully. Queer visibility is important and, at the risk of braggadocio, transforms lives.
I'm a postdoc (PhD in Physics), and while I'm not aware of any enbies on my team, a couple different people have pronouns in their zoom bios and I make a habit of wearing pride stuff whenever I can. Academics are usually among the more open-minded people as a rule, which gets them 3/4 of the way to being allies without really trying. That's not to say there aren't any bigots, these are humans we're talking about, but academia tends to be a relatively accepting environment on average.
Thanks for sharing, you make me want to be more visible!
Hooray! I‚Äôm in medieval studies and while *hobby* medievalists can unfortunately skew anti-progressive, the departments I‚Äôve dealt with in North America and Europe have been progressive nearly to a person. There‚Äôs usually multiple enbies/GNC/trans people at conferences, and even if there aren‚Äôt, I‚Äôve never had a moment‚Äôs pause with my pronouns or pins or anything.

Hello from a PhD Biologist Enby (they/them)! I haven't met anyone else in our field that was nonbinary either. What is your subfield?
Kinda feel inspired to put myself out there further. I'm a bio grad student, I sport a pride pin, but working up the courage to put my pronoun pin on. Some queer people in my lab certainly know what's up. New people who ask my pronouns I let them know it is they/them, but for people who know me most, like my PI, I am trying to work up the courage. It's a slow transition, but she uses my gender-neutral nickname. I am changing my gender marker and first name (lucky for me, my gender-neutral nickname will work for that too!!) sometime this year so it certainly is going to come out.   


Also next semester I will be teaching a lab so I'll be sure to let my students know. Maybe I can inspire someone to be their genuine self. :)
I honestly hadn‚Äôt met any openly trans or nonbinary people in my field either until yesterday, so I definitely get the isolated feeling. I was thrilled to finally meet someone, and I hope you do too!
I‚Äôm so glad you have so many now, and that you‚Äôve been able to be an inspiration to younger students! People like you are a treasure to the younger generations üíú
I‚Äôm a physics PhD student in the US, you can dm me if you want. I‚Äôve had no issues at all‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm very gender nonconforming, use they/them pronouns etc. I‚Äôve found the department very supportive

Woah no way, I'm a higher category theorist (in Scotland)!!
Sleep and circadian rhythms. Bit of genetics. Bit of neuroscience. I got my degree and I'm a teaching professor now, but have a tiny bit of research going still.
Not sure what I will do after my PhD, keeping an open mind towards industry (likely quantum computing), national labs, and academia and I know people who have pursued all of these paths.

One of the nice things about physics is that there are tons of research positions for physics PhDs outside of academia so you will have options. It definitely reduces my stress to know that if I don‚Äôt want to compete for academic jobs I can still have a career in my field :)

My partner is NB and I‚Äôm... still figuring out what the heck I am. I‚Äôm somewhere between genderfluid and trans, but super terrified by all the negative aspects about being trans. GF lets me turn my femme on and off when I want to.

It‚Äôs good to discover yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è I‚Äôm so happy that you found that much more about yourself.
I remember when I figured it out- it simultaneously felt super awesome, but also difficult because I didn't feel valid. But that came with time and meeting other NB people.
Hooray! It's such a freeing feeling! 
I'm still not super certain but I've been feeling it out as a fit for me, and it feels pretty nice.
I feel the exact same way. It‚Äôs been v tough for me as a femme person who feels invalidated by the fact that they look like a girl and have a vagina bc it‚Äôs like why can‚Äôt i just be a girl? But I‚Äôm me and I‚Äôm starting to get better at accepting it. 
I think I figured it out like 2 days ago. It felt right. But also oh god oh god oh god I‚Äôm 36 and married oh god oh god oh god. Just delving into the world now.

I am angry	"TW: religious trauma

I think I‚Äôd have identified as non-binary either way but I am so angry at the way my religious trauma has impacted the relationship I have my body and my gender.

When I (AFAB) am labeled as a woman or lumped in with people‚Äôs expectations of a woman I feel so trapped. It‚Äôs to the point where I‚Äôm to scared to even wear a skirt. I love cute fashion and It brings me a lot of joy but I can‚Äôt fully let myself have fun with it because I‚Äôm always trying to hide any sign of ‚Äúwomanness‚Äù it‚Äôs like prison bars coming down over my self expression.

Does anyone else feel this way?

For context I was raised as a true believer in the LDS faith. (Mormon)"	"I‚Äôm really sorry for the religious trauma you have. I can relate as I was also raised Mormon. I‚Äôm cis (my kiddo is enby which is why I‚Äôm here) but when I left the religion I couldn‚Äôt stand to wear skirts or dresses as it signified ‚Äúchurch‚Äù to me. It took me like a decade to even consider wearing a skirt or dress just for fun, especially if it was ‚Äúmodest‚Äù (I really hate that word).  I struggled with the strict gender norms even as a woman. I‚Äôve found time and working through your trauma (with a therapist or whatever works for you) and time have helped with a lot of the trauma. Also, moving far away from Mormons (I lived in a heavily Mormon-populated area) really helped with my mental health. Your feelings are valid and very normal. I hope you can work through them and find a way to improve your relationship with yourself. Mormonism really tanks your self esteem and worth and it sucks having to learn it when you‚Äôre older, not to mention unlearning all the toxic crap you‚Äôre indoctrinated with.
I relate. I'm only just getting comfortable wearing skirts around the house, can't imagine going out in one yet, even though I love them. My roommates are super accepting which helps tremendously.
i was raised fundamentalist evangelical, and i had a very similar experience. wearing anything too ""girly"" felt dangerous, and like i was just accepting my fate of ""being ladylike"" and ""being a good Christian woman"" and everything that entailed. 

dressing modestly felt like being trapped, but dressing """"""""""""""""immodestly"""""""""""""""""""" felt dangerous too. it kinda felt like the only thing i could wear was shapeless, ugly menswear, even though that was the last thing i wanted to wear and didn't actually hide anything that i wanted it to.

i can say that at least in my case, it got easier. ive been out for almost two decades now and even though i still have those thoughts of danger and immodesty and what have you, I've found ways that i can wear what i want and still make it my own, if that makes sense. like i currently dress in long skirts but i look like a feral woods witch and I'm pretty sure if i rolled up to a fundie church dressed like i that I'd get some severe side-eyes and maybe some chick tracts for good measure ¬Ø\\\_ („ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Fellow exmo enby!! I left the church 3 years ago but only found out I‚Äôm non binary a few months ago so it‚Äôs been really amazing to look back at my life and just feel so validated for the way I reacted to things and the thoughts I had. I‚Äôm not crazy, my thoughts are valid, I am non binary! 

I can completely relate to the skirt problem and the way it makes you feel! I have several outfits that are very feminine but I can‚Äôt seem to wear them for that same reason. I have only been able to wear one of my skirts and only because it gives me a boho kinda vibe which makes me feel free from that ‚Äúcover your knees!‚Äù type of control the church had over me, a not so rebellious but a taking back my power type of feel. I live in st George though so I hate wearing it out and about on Sunday because I hate the idea of being perceived as a mormon. If the skirt wasn‚Äôt as revealing of my thigh I don‚Äôt think I would be able to wear it. Being raised mormon sure messes you up and it takes for ever to deconstruct. It‚Äôs sad that we all went through this but it‚Äôs nice to not feel so alone‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm AMAB and I feel so related to this, I‚Äôm struggling hard to express my femininity because of the culture I come from I have so many wounds around it, everytime I wear something that makes me feel good, I have great feelings then immediately after pain.
Fellow AFAB Ex-Mormon here (pioneer-stock type, hello intergenerational trauma!) and yes, same! I served a mission and left the church shortly after, and 10 years later I still haven‚Äôt figured out how to reclaim skirts and dresses or some of the more ‚Äúretro‚Äù styles I used to be into back when I had to figure out how to stay modest while feeling cute. Even with years of therapy down and more to come, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever shake the second-guessing I do about clothing and my body (and interacting physically with others), although I hope there‚Äôs another side to this. 

Solidarity!
I relate. I was raised Mennonite, and I also think I'd have been nonbinary either way, but I resent the traumatic effects of my religious upbringing on my relationship to gender.
I'm so sorry you had to go through that. I hope you are in a better place now. Healing takes some time. You can wear what you want without fear one day. Remember you are always valid!
Yes I feel and have felt this way. I have always loved dressing up and clothes and hair and nails and makeup and everything fun and beautiful that people of all genders deserve to play with. 

But I hated being read as female. Internally it felt right but externally it clashed. Once i got top surgery and my facial hair started coming in, I felt much freer to get back into makeup and even some skirts and dresses - now it feels like the right kind of femininity and not a trap. 

It's really weird to explain to people that my story doesn't follow a binary trans timeline, even though when I look at pics of myself as a kid I'm like ""look at that lil scrapper in a crown and a dress go them""

I don't have religious trauma but I do have a lot of sexual trauma in my story as well as in my mothers story and my family etc. I see a lot of overlap between nb survivors of religious trauma and nb survivors of sexual trauma. Both experiences revolve around the idea that your body is not yours, your body is unruly and must be policed, your body makes this your fault, your body is the reason there is sin. 

It's a lot. <3
Yeah I hate how clothes are so gendered in society. The first instinct people have is to gender someone they have no business' gendering. I wish people were more knowledgeable and open minded about the trans community. I think getting a good group of accepting friends might help and definitly stop hanging around religious folks.
You are pretty much describing me right now. 
Not ex-Mormon but ex-evangelical/vaguely Pentecostal. I've identified as gender fluid since I was 15 and very much still do, but for years I couldn't actually connect to the feminine or ""woman"" part of me except in theory. I hated my curvy ""feminine"" body type to the point that I eventually developed an ED trying to change it, and always wore oversized, ""sexless""-looking clothes to hide. Any kind of sexual expression was also a no-go bc, y'know, that would require thinking about my body. I had a fight-or-flight response to being called a woman or, like you said, lumped in with women. I considered that maybe I was actually binary FtM, but I didn't like the thought of transitioning and then being read as male for the rest of my life either -- my fluidity felt really important to who I was, I just felt like I was locked out of the part of me that was a woman. It was *there,* just inaccessible.
The point that that changed? Yeah, it was when I left the church. The more I've deconstructed, the more I've realized that my upbringing left my relationship to my own gender completely FUBAR. I couldn't express my femininity without almost having panic attacks, because I associated feminine presentation with being dismissed, rebuked, ignored, and vulnerable to violence. But then, I wasn't expressing my masculinity in a healthy way, either, because the only masculinity I'd ever had modeled for me was domineering, overcompetitive, repressed, and chauvinistic. It took me years to unlearn all of that.
It's only been in the past year or two that I've gotten to a point where I feel like I've embraced the full spectrum of my fluidity.
Nice to see another exmo enby here! I can very much relate with your post. Skirts and dresses have so much religious baggage for me, even after I stopped going to church and experimented with more ‚Äúimmodest‚Äù clothing. A lot of ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù clothing feels to me like a societal label saying ‚Äútreat me differently‚Äù, which is the last thing I want. It‚Äôs probably since there‚Äôs such a repressive gender binary within the Mormon church. 

I also have to wonder how my chest dysphoria was affected by purity culture. I‚Äôm very much glad I got top surgery, but wonder if I would feel differently if I wasn‚Äôt constantly being told to hide my cleavage/curves and to not be a temptation to the men around me. I hated the scrutiny and objectification I experienced just for having a large chest.
I appreciate your response. Knowing I‚Äôm not alone is nice but when it comes to Mormonism I really wish no one else had to experience it.

Oddly tho I love wearing my shirt shorts and crop tops. Even got myself some pentagram earrings to wear when I‚Äôm angry as my way of saying F you to the universe!
Yes yes yes! And as someone nearly a decade into the journey, so reassuring to hear that there‚Äôs a light at the end of the tunnel. I lived in Utah for about a year after I left the church, didn‚Äôt even spare it a backwards glance when I got free. Made a HUGE difference in my ability to breathe, rest, and start to recover my humanity.
My little sister and I like to dress up together so I feel like I‚Äôm missing out kinda.
I love the feral woods witch vibes. ‚ù§Ô∏è
You should get an even shorter skirt for Sundays! Lol
I‚Äôm sorry you have to struggle with that.
Thank you for the solidarity ‚ù§Ô∏è
*hugs* for you.
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
Your body is yours, and only yours. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I appreciate your response. I feel like you explained that really well. Like how being labels as a woman makes me feel like I‚Äôm expected to be motherly, quiet, submissive, and obedient. And the men are repressed emotionally and yet put on a pedestal.
I‚Äôm actually really surprised at how many exmo (or other religion) enbys there are here!
Good for you!  Channel that FU energy. It will aid you in life.  I‚Äôm certain in time you‚Äôll get comfortable with skirts again. Just be patient with yourself and give yourself grace. You have a shit ton of brainwashing to undo. 

I also wish no one had to experience the trauma involved with Mormonism. I‚Äôm just glad I got out and spared my kids that toxicity even though I had to deal with it myself.
Listen. I‚Äôm not saying this to discount your (former or current) beliefs. Just giving my personal perspective.

Yeah sure, the pentagram represents Satan in the context of Christianity and is generally regarded as ‚Äúevil‚Äù. But in other religions and belief systems, the pentagram is a positive thing, reguardless of whether it‚Äôs upside down or upright. I understand you can‚Äôt change how you feel overnight, but part of your liberation might come from learning how to stop demonizing things the way the church does.

Whatever happened to you, these real and perceived threats, it‚Äôs all in the past now. Learn to love the universe, don‚Äôt just say fuck it.
Maybe when you're dressing up with your sister try to see if you can put yourself more on the mindset of "" It's just drag""? Wonder if that would help?
I‚Äôm really happy for your kids. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Yes! I have learned about some of that. My earrings are technically pentacles. A symbol of protection I think. 

Im not wearing them because I think they are bad. I enjoy the different symbolism and meanings behind them. But I also enjoy the uncomfortable or disgusted looks on the random Christian ladies faces.
I think it would be easier once I have top surgery. Because these boobs make it hard to see it that way.
Also I like your user name. I never got to watch all of their videos."	10gpqul	NonBinary	152	1.0	2023-01-20 06:34:06

a lil jealous of your great find tbh !!!
Hey Evren! Love to chat and be friends.
nice to meet you evren!! your name is super cool!!!!
Evren is such a cool name üòç

Found my name last week and I'm still testing it because I'm an anxious little bean but today I will tell it to my therapist.
Hmm, Out Of Curiosity, Where Did You Get That Name? I Don't Think I've Ever Heard It Before, But It Sounds Pretty Neat!
Congratulations!!
So happy you found your name, Evren!! What a powerful feeling it must be. Love the glasses, too!
A wonderful name!
I love that name!
Beautiful name, Evren! I think it‚Äôs very fae sounding. I‚Äôm Sylvan, so together we sound like a pair of magical enby faeries üòä
Hey Evren!
That‚Äôs awesome that you found your name, I‚Äôve spent 4 years and I‚Äôm still looking for mine, very proud!... can I be proud? Idk I just want friends I literally have none
Hello!!!

It took a few days to find if I‚Äôm being honest but once you know you really know! Just gotta be patient! ‚ù§Ô∏è

Of course you can be proud! I appreciate it :)
Thank you. I appreciate that!
Thank youüò≠üíú

I'm proud of you too.
It's not easy sometimes to find a new name that feels right for you after living for years with another one.
Hmm, Neat! Not Sure Why, But It Reminds Me Of Casran (I Think That's How It's Spelled), From The Doctor Who Christmas Carol.
That is true!

Had my first HRT appt yesterday! Still keeping the beard as long as E will let me üòã I was feeling this outfit and jumping for joy when they approved me for hormones. Can't wait to fill out the top soon! üòÜ		"Good news is that on E you can have your beard as long as you like. 

Bad news is that on E you‚Äôre going to have your beard until you have it removed by laser or electrolysis. Laser can remove dark hair but your grey facial hair will likely need electrolysis. 

E will possibly lessen body hair but not facial hair.
Idk what your goal is, but I can already tell you're going to rock it.
Congrats!! I have my first appointment in a week and am so excited. I‚Äôm thinking I might keep my facial hair for the first year too. 
Love your hair!
It‚Äôs always so nice to see you!
I would stay just like that.  Too good of a look with the beard.  Why mess with a good thing.
Ha! Thanks! Give me them curves baby!
Thanks! I'm taking it slow. Been transitioning nearly 2 years now. Can't seem to shake the beard. I personally love it but being taken seriously as a feminine person is hard sometimes.
I‚Äôm just starting. I‚Äôve just had mine for so long and prefer the shape of my chin/jaw with it. I shaved this month, mostly self conscious and afraid not to be taken seriously in appointments. But I‚Äôm also really anxious about social transitioning and am tempted to keep the facial hair to continue boy-moding until I find out how I feel on hormones and about coming out to people."	sa6ox4	NonBinary	143	0.99	2022-01-22 16:55:48

made this lil reel to show my enby joy. Lou (they/it) pronouns.		"Oh my goodness!!! You look amazing!! Absolutely love the look üíö
You look is very gendered.  Gorgeous also.
I was called it as an insult so I was like fuck I kinda like it  as a pronoun. Makes me think of It or cousin It two types of power
Hell yeah! I dont use ""it"" openly but with my partner and other enbys it is my favorite pronoun. I just feel as an autistic person who experienced alot of abuse Ive been dehumanized alot and so maybe thats why ive never felt entirely comfortable with they because its a lil tooo human. Lol.
I relate to this so much. Like honestly I am just now coming to terms I am non binary, gender fluid. I thought everyone felt this way... like I was genuinely confused when people are like I can feel like a man or a woman. I feel like an etinity or or anxiety ü§£
In all ways but physical I am actually a mushroom.
‚ÄúGenuinely confused‚Äù really?  Not some new concept.
Yeah. Because I figured everyone felt like that and the terms used are rather new. Back in my day the term adrgoney was what usually used."	vs9r5q	NonBinary	134	0.97	2022-07-05 22:12:42
New user, hello~ I‚Äôve traditionally not identified as non-binary, but I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm questioning, a bit of impostor syndrome sometimes. I love pink, and so I got a cute outfit for Halloween, and the joy it gave me was so strong compared to my normal mood, everyone at work could see it in my face.		"skirt go spinny!!!

you are totally valid to post here. to me non-binary just means anyone who isn't cis and isn't binary trans.
I hope it‚Äôs okay for me to post here.  I‚Äôm interested in hanging around and seeing how others in the community are doing and maybe learn some things/get some inspiration~
Awesome look! I hope you know that no matter how confusing your gender journey is, people will support you. You are beautiful/handsome, and valid no matter how you feel comfortable. I wish you all the luck! :)))
Shhhh, you‚Äôre beautiful and valid
I have those same shoes!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you!  The truth is, I‚Äôve always considered myself cisgender.  I still use he/him pronouns.  I don‚Äôt want to appropriate anything from others, though, and I had similar feelings for a long time about my sexuality before I accepted that my bisexuality is valid.  But I spend a lot of time reading and talking to friends and figures in the trans and non-binary community, and I read an article by Sam Dylan Finch where he talked about some ways one can try to figure out if they might not be cis, and even though not everything applied to me, there were quite a few that struck a chord with me, and the gender euphoria I get from dressing and acting more traditionally feminine is very real (I don‚Äôt feel like a girl, I just feel...comfy).  Basically, I don‚Äôt know yet how I really feel, but thank you for welcoming me and I hope to learn more about myself from being here~

I feel like I know a decent amount about gender, and when it comes to anyone else, I operate under the policy of ‚Äúif person says they are x, that is what they are‚Äù regardless of how they look, dress, speak, or whatever.  For some reason, I have a harder time doing that with myself.  Is it valid to say that I‚Äôm a cisgender man whose gender expression is not always aligned with ‚Äútraditionally masculine‚Äù expressions?  Or is that just a round-about way of saying that my gender itself is outside the binary in some way?
Thank you so much!
of course! those people might be called ""gender non-conforming"", but again labels are entirely up to you. believe it or not, people can use whatever pronouns and gender label they want, regardless of presentation.

i think for a lot of people, non-binary labels allow them space to experiment and question their gender without feeling restricted, but each person can approach it differently.
I found Sam Dylan Finch‚Äôs blog, but can you point me at the specific article you mentioned?

Thank you. I‚Äôm pretty much in the same situation.
Yes, for sure.  I definitely understand that, and I am hoping I can tone down my own worries and insecurities and just breathe about it.  Part of it is fear of being fake, even though I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôs not...and I think part of it also comes from the fact that, living in a small, regressive, Midwest town, I don‚Äôt have the opportunity to explore and experiment as much.  Or, at the very least, I‚Äôm afraid to.  I‚Äôve definitely experienced less bullying and anti-lgbtq+ hate as I‚Äôve gotten older (mainly because I don‚Äôt put up with that shit), but the residual effects of that stuff when I was younger makes it difficult to just be myself without worrying about being targeted.  I like that way of putting it, though, and it helps.  I kind of like the sound of gender non-conforming.  It feels like it fits pretty well.
Absolutely!  [This](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/07/am-i-non-binary/) is the article I was referring to.  When I got to the part about gender euphoria, something clicked in my mind and I thought ‚ÄúOh.  There‚Äôs a word for that thing I was experiencing.‚Äù  And it helped me a little.  I hope it can help you. üòä

Being Acknowledged by Cishet People	"Ever since I came out as an enby I‚Äôve only had relations with other queer people. I recently started seeing a cis guy, and I was quite anxious about how he would react to me being non-binary, my pronouns, body image etc. He was very understanding and very supportive to the point that he asked me if we could explain to his family that I‚Äôm non-binary together, because he wanted them to accept me as who I am. Even when I mentioned that I was uncomfortable with my breasts, he asked if I wanted to get too surgery and when I said yes, he said that he‚Äôd support me until the end. We recently started dating and he‚Äôs not slipping about calling me his ‚Äúpartner‚Äù and not a gendered term. 
I know these should be considered bare minimum and I probably shouldn‚Äôt be this happy about someone just respecting my identity, but god does it make me overload with joy. Being fully acknowledged, accepted and respected by people who don‚Äôt quite understand or relate to your identity is on a different level for me. His behavior has eased my anxiety so much and basically proved all of my fears wrong and I even feel like crying from happiness writing this."	"I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôve found someone who is supportive and accepting of your identity! Really glad you have that kind of person in your life. Wishing the best for the both of you.
u definitely should feel happy abt getting respect! it sounds like u might not have had all that much in the past
That's so great they support you
I love this for you! I've been struggling with getting people to use the correct terms, and it sucks because it also comes from other non-binaries. I physically cant present androgynous due to my masculine features but everyone defaults to he/him and man. The amount of times an 'ally' or other lgbt person has misgendered me and didnt seem to care is astounding. I'm beginning to think its because of how I look.
Yayyy! I'm so happy for you \^\^ I definitely get both sides of this, dating people that don't get it really, and then people that are super awesome about it even though they're cis! I wish you the best of luck.
This is so nice and sweet! I hope the best for you two
He sounds like a keeper and im happy youve found someone who is willing to support you through everything and is willing to go at a pace that makes you comfortable and helps your settle when you need it. Theres no alot of nice people in this world sad to say but when we meet em it makes it that more better and its warming youve found someone who down to earth i wish you all the best
Thank you so much!
I‚Äôve mostly surrounded myself with queer people so it‚Äôs not too bad, but my family doesn‚Äôt know therefore it‚Äôs constant misgendering on their part and the family members who do know, along with the other cishet people that I‚Äôve told, while not in bad faith, can‚Äôt really understand the situation therefore end up being a bit stupid around it haha. So it feels really nice to be accepted purely, no questioning involved. Thank you for your comment!
People alot of the time have that misunderstanding but theres quite a few reasons why it happens none of em your fault i might add but it could be people just dont know or they might be confused. But this is understandable it happens to me all the time and i usually listen to the tone if their voice as to if they are genuine or trying to insult me. If they are geuine ill politely correct them so they know in the future if they are trying to insult me ill pride my wsy through and say its my life not yours i csn do what i like snd it usually shuts them right up and ill walk away. Im not afraid to fight but ill never strike first (self defense law) i dont mean to mean but the best thing to combat it is to be thick skined and stick to your guns no one can get to you but you have a bite snd its part of being hsppy with yourself. The more you accept yourself the more people will accept you. Its like a saying from rupaul (roast me if you will but its a bloody good saying) if you can't love yourself how in the hell you gonna love somebody else. Ive misgendered alot of people so now i ask before i even start the conversation but you cant expect people to do that its like driving you treat everyone like an idiot. So you keep 2 seconds distance from the driver in front  and you watch what they do.

Pro tip: wedges are way more practical to do physical work in, if you wanted to keep them on while cleaning. But your shoes in the pic are amazing.
Ah, appreciate the tip. Still learning to walk in heels.  I am honestly thrilled to wear feminine shoes.
If you're still learning, I'd definitely invest in some wedges, if you want some feminine shoes you can wear for a while and do things in, they're much easier to walk in than heels.

Wait til you try some cargo pants.
Fifth pocket is standard in every pair of men's jeans I've owned. Many years ago when I was still smoking, I used it for my lighter.
I LOVE POCKETS

Men's jackets have so many pockets you can fit almost your entire life on them omg

I wish I could use men's pants, but I have to buy them very oversized and make several adjustements and there will still be loose fabric in the front like someone stole my dick D:
I like the way they are sized. What's your waist. What's your leg. How tight you want em. Boom. Fitting pants. 
None of this 2 4 6 8 etc. but a 2 isn't the same here as it is there. What do the numbers even mean? Pls send a guide
Hey, that sounds exactly like me when I thrifted my first men's pants! If the secret pocket is what I'm thinking of it's originally meant for a pocket watch!
Congrats! I think it's a coin pocket but I use them for any random trinket. They're on every pair of men's pants lol
I use the secret inside pocket for change or matches/lighter.
I absolutely love posts like this they are so wholesome and cute. Congrats on your new pants. Also if you want even bigger pockets get a pair of cargo pants
Welcome to pocket heaven dear sibling!
Same for me with women's pants except the pocket situation üôà (and effect on the silhouette, obv)
All hail pockets üôè
Pocket watch pocket, loop the chain round your belt and you are good to go. Unless it's one of the rare fashion pair of trousers where they have atrophied the pocket down to uselessness.
I wish I could use those T_T but I got think legs and men pants usually create chafing for me. Is there a hack for this?
I live in cargos. I go from long to short. üòÇ
Pocket watches, huh, that's interesting
Oh neat! The one in this particular pair of pants is just barely big enough to fit my phone, so I guess that origin story is particularly appropriate.
Yes!! I have a jacket that has two giant pockets, a zippered pocket, and an inner pocket - so much more functional than any purse I have ever owned :O
Oh my gosh, THIS. If we're going to use these meaningless numbers for sizes, can we at least have them be consistent üôÑ
I just wish there was a thigh or hip/ass measurement too! I‚Äôll never be able to fit all this cake in standard men‚Äôs pants üòû
I am very new to the men's pants scene, honestly I just went to the thrift store and tried on a bunch of things until something looked good. A friend of mine with bigger thighs likes to wear athletic cut pants, maybe you'd have some luck with those?
HELL YEAH, my favorite jacket could even fit a book or a small umbrella on one of the pockets.

After some time I got bold, after just carrying around my cellphone, keys and my wallet I started carrying tissue paper, lip balm... then a notepad, pens, a few masks, and ended up walking around with an endless supply of lollipops. I'm the lollipop god now."	z28l4g	NonBinary	91	1.0	2022-11-22 23:21:16
Hey, if you‚Äôre wondering if you can still be non-binary and...	"...yes. Yes you can.

Being non-binary is defined by what it isn‚Äôt, which means there are as many valid ways of being non-binary as there are non-binary people. If you want to break away from the binary genders *for whatever reason* then you‚Äôre valid.

You don‚Äôt need to do anything more than that to be valid. Anything else is up to you and your joy.

Be who you are.

You‚Äôre free."	"I sometimes feel tempted to identify as non-binary, because I think gender is a social construct and that assigning people into these arbitrary two categories makes no sense. But at the same time, I seem pretty much to be your typical man in appearance and behavior (other than the fact that I‚Äôm gay), and I use male pronouns. So I feel like I don‚Äôt ‚Äúqualify‚Äù as being able to be non-binary. To make a long story short, thank you for this post! It gives me a little more confidence where I needed it üòÑ

realizing your gender is yours and yours only is so freeing. and so is seeing people who have realized this.	"i love being nonbinary. i love this community i love seeing people be themselves i love seeing people who‚Äôs identities ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make sense‚Äù i love seeing people be themselves. you don‚Äôt have to make sense to anyone. your identity is yours and yours only.

this post was made after seeing a fully transitioned transmasc who still uses she/her and idk why but something clicked. don‚Äôt even know what. but i just love seeing peoples unique identities i love seeing people live authentically and i love seeing people be themselves without caring about other peoples opinions (as someone who currently cares a little too much about other peoples opinions). idk. i just love people, seeing people be free from gender norms is so freeing and i genuinely feel bad that exclusionists will never feel that type of joy. rant over."	"idk just with all the transphobia in the world, even in our own community, seeing other gnc people living authentically despite everything is so nice. your transness is your own and so are your experiences. i hope when i‚Äôm fully comfortable in my identity i can make others feel this way too.
Yessss. It was so freeing when I realized that I was never going to be a certain gender that other people also are. That I can be everything, that I can be nothing, that I can be exactly the pieces that I already am in the way that I am and I can be exactly the pieces that I pick from the medical and societal changes that I want and that show me off, and nobody else gets to police that or tell me I'm experiencing myself wrong. I can be everything. I am everything. I am nothing. I've always been. I'll be for as long as I can. I've already won, I've already succeeded.
I only recently realized that i‚Äôm not strictly a girl or a guy, it‚Äôs such a neat feeling to just be me.
Many studies show that asking participants to fill out their gender on a self evaluation tests actually affects their self-perception on said test. Simply being reminded of their gender and society's expectations of their gender made women rate their math skills lower and men rate their artistic skills lower.

I love detaching myself from any concept of gender. I love seeing my skills and positive attributes for what they are. I love being unclouded from gendered concepts of what I should or shouldn't try. Freeing is the exact word I use.
I agree üíñ

First post. So a couple days ago I figured I'm either NB and/or GNC. I tend to over think things, but I know I'm not female. Wearing clothing marketed towards women gives me an overwhelming sense of joy. More in comments! ü•∞		"Also if anyone has any input on if I could be nb and/or gnc or how I could present more feminine, please let me know. Super noob, and would love help and guidance haha...
Hey, I saw someone posted a comment, but its not showing up. üòï
[deleted]
something subtle that make you feel more feminine are thin bracelets, well manicured nails (not even painted just clean cut and filed), painting your toe nails, wearing necklaces under a shirt, wearing a sports bra or bralette (can be bought at target or walmart)

and ik some people feel anxious about buying things ‚Äúnot meant‚Äù for the gender they‚Äôre assigned, saying you‚Äôre buying something for your girlfriend or sister works

these tips brought to you by an afab nb person with a who does the opposite of these. i‚Äôm not the most knowledgeable person on appearing more femme but hopefully these help :)
If you want to present yourself more feminine you could try some make-up, not like alot cause a little can go a long way. You could find some tutorials on YouTube. That's what I've been looking up, but more for seeming more masculine.
Nail polish!! Anklets!!!! Eyeliner!!!
It's doing that in my post, not sure what that's about
Thank you!!! It's the first outfit I bought to wear out in public and I'm in love! üòç

The joy and pain all at once.Crying all morning not wanting to ever take them off. Is this what it really feels like? I know I'm trans but will always be living in an conflicted body. My breasts were always supposed to be there. Why can't they be real? Idk what to do!		"if you can't grow your own breasts, store bought is fine. but also you could start hrt and then they could be real
I would be happy to give you mine if I could, I'm sure I was supposed to have the flattest chest in the west
I don't want breasts, I see the struggle plenty of people have with them. I also don't want my genitals. I don't know what to do. Finding a middle ground is so hard that I have to rely on outward expression, but that only makes me so happy.
Maybe someday. Maybe not. Im getting old. I feel safer in between for now. I won't lose everything if I can just take them off. Just a little sadness
lots of people medically transition later on life! it's never too late to make your body the way you want it!
You are never too old to become the person you want to be! That being said you never have to medically transition, I‚Äôm non binary and I‚Äôm not planning on getting top surgery the other way round!

Even though it‚Äôs just a wig and some lip color, the amount of joy I had when I saw myself in the mirror like this was amazing.		"That color looks really good on you!
Also, because I feel the need to mention it, I am using a wig for two reasons:
1) I do not feel comfortable coming out with work and my family. (I have only come out to a few friends and my partner)
2) My hair is *super* curly and unruly normally (and I keep it cut short for work.)
I love the hair + lip color combo! You look rad.
Thanks! A friend of mine linked me a site they use for wigs, and then I found the style I wanted. I was going to go with something more like my natural hair color, but they were out of that color. I then saw this color and fell in love with it. I showed my friends and partner the color and they all encouraged me, so I got it. And I do not regret it one bit.
Thanks! I‚Äôve had the lip color for a while, but didn‚Äôt realize how well it worked with the hair color until I wore them both together."	nem9ml	NonBinary	74	0.99	2021-05-17 17:26:10

my trans clients finally got their first chest binder!!!!!!	"i‚Äôm a non-binary/transmasc clinician working with transgender foster kids in a residential behavioral health setting. ive worked with my team for nearly a year to try and get these two kids (ftm + ftn) a chest binder. A YEAR!!! we‚Äôve had so many ups and downs, so many referrals and approvals, and so many hoops we had to jump through just to get our agency to shell out $70 fucking dollars for some gc2b chest binders. 

we (of course) made sure to instruct them about all necessary safety measures on how to bind properly, and also showed them how to put it on/take it off. it‚Äôs funny because they know i‚Äôm trans but im not sure if they‚Äôre aware i use a chest binder as well (we obviously avoid self-disclosing personal stuff due to potential transference).

AND (drum roll) WE FINALLY DID IT!!!!! the kids tried their binders on for the first time this week and were so excited. i wanted to cry out of joy for them!!! i hate the system and how much we had to fight for them to have access to something so basic and simple as a chest binder. but i‚Äôm so so happy that it all worked out in the end. these kids deserve it."

Good job fighting their corner! They‚Äôre lucky to have you. Good job!
omg yes absolutely! it was a really disheartening/frustrating experience, but it‚Äôs also motivating me to try and fix (at least some aspects of) the system from the inside out
thank you! honestly, i‚Äôm the lucky one to be able to work with them. they‚Äôre such incredible kids and they deserve the world!!"	mw81e9	NonBinary	55	0.98	2021-04-22 16:02:13
I'm sad at my partner's reaction that I might be genderfluid	"I've been out as nonbinary for over a year now. Recently I started identifying as transmasc, and using he/they pronouns. But after a few weeks, I started feeling femme again, so I told my partner that I might be genderfluid. He's been having a hard time with me being transmasc, and got really excited that ""girl Riley"" wasn't gone. He said that he could be fine with ""boy Riley"" if it meant that he wasn't losing the person he fell in love with. . .

I know it should make me happy that he's finding acceptance in my identity, because I love him. But it makes me feel depressed. . . Because it means if I am either wrong about being genderfluid, or if I had been right about being transmasc, then he still wouldn't be able to accept me as I am. And it makes me wonder why I'm still doing this. If I am genderfluid, then there seem to be long periods between shifts. Sometimes days or weeks, maybe even months. And if he doesn't like ""boy Riley"" and is just waiting for ""girl Riley"" to come back, does that mean our relationship will fall apart every time I feel masc? I don't know how often I'll be femme, but I don't think it's going to be very often. I went an entire year switching between masc and neutral, and have only felt femme for a couple of days now.

I know I'm in a relationship with a straight man. And I know it's not his fault he's not attracted to masc people. But for weeks he's been saying that he thought he could come to accept me as masc. And at the first sign of ""girl Riley"" coming back, he jumped for joy. And that hurts. . ."	"All I can offer is this: don't set yourself on fire trying keep other people warm. Be you, whoever that is. 

Sending love ‚ù§Ô∏è
I think it‚Äôs too soon to tell what will happen to your relationship. My wife isn‚Äôt attracted to my more feminine appearance but it wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker. We‚Äôve got to experience some good things we wouldn‚Äôt have if I hadn‚Äôt come out. She still supports me even if she prefers a more masculine presentation from me.

Maybe together you can find some reasons he can appreciate you being masc, and neutral. It can take a while to get used to changes.

If either of you are feeling unfulfilled in the relationship though it‚Äôs ok to break it off. Neither of you should have to be in an unhappy place.
Wow this is almost word for word what I said to my spouse when they first said they were genderfluid. It started the same way, they thought they were trans, then one day (months later) they switched genders. And my response was basically the same. Being excited that I hadn't 'lost' my wife.

The good news is, I adjusted to it. I look forward to seeing my spouse, whether they are a man, woman, or neither. I actually enjoy it when they switch, especially knowing that my acceptance makes them happy. 
Granted, I am pansexual, and have known that since we started dating. So maybe for me it was inevitable. But regardless, don't count him out just yet. Some people just need time. 

Obviously don't put yourself in a miserable situation just for the off chance he gets used to it. Do what's best for you in the end. I just wanted to give you a point of view from someone who once had that exact (admittedly harmful) reaction. 

I'm sorry his reaction hurt so much. Your feelings are valid. I hope things get better ‚ù§Ô∏è
You are discovering yourself and it‚Äôs completely okay. Someone using very questionable and seemingly manipulative narrative of losing someone they love because they‚Äôre growing is not acceptable and I would question if that is actually love.
Love is complicated. It doesn't have to have sexual attraction, though it helps. You need to talk and be honest about your feelings -- all of them, negative included. And find a comfortable place where you'll both be happy. If your partner won't or can't agree on a way that makes BOTH if you happy, it may be worth seeking outside help or taking a little break.
he isn't losing the person he fell in love with, you're changing. if his hangup is about your presentation/expression/body, that's a separate issue from *who you are* and should not be lumped together imo. if he's stuck being in love with the old you... the you that wasn't able to be yourself... then what part of you did he actually fall in love with?
I hope that you‚Äôre able to work this out in a way that feels good to you both, but I‚Äôll also say this: You deserve to have someone who celebrates you and all that you are, not just parts of you.
You're doing the right thing by engaging in that dialogue with yourself about yourself, and figuring out how to act on those feelings. This is a process of discovery and it's really special that you're committing to experiencing it. If he's not able to engage in that process with you, that says more about him and where he's at than what is possible or meaningful for you. If he can't deal with what you're presenting then he's not allowing himself to see you, and it honestly sounds like his real struggle is letting go of an idea of you he's holding onto, that 'girl Riley' being back means he doesn't have to confront those emotions -- that's not your responsibility to bear. He's going to have to do the work and he's going to have to reconcile the person he wants against the person he's with, and it's not going to be good for either of you to avoid that conversation. I hope the best for you both."	110tin1	NonBinary	54	0.98	2023-02-12 23:28:56

I thought I was one of the lucky ones.	"I was wrong. [30ish, AMAB, NB, they/them, just dont call me sir.]

This is about to get very very very long, but i just need to write it out.


[BACKGROUND]


I grew up in a very small town. Until around the time I got into middle school, the entire school district, outside of the high school, had a single combined year book consisting of maybe 60 pages in a paper back book. I had very very limited exposure, if at all, to anything outside of white, hetero relationships. Everyone went to church and all the adults in my life (my parents included) had got married to their high school sweethearts at 20 and stayed in town. 

I was very sheltered from sexual stuff, while also being exposed to its effects by my father's repeated philandering. I grew up knowing I was going to be the BEST dad ever. I was going to be there how my father wasn't. I was going to find a girlfriend, marry her, have kids, and settle back into my home town. I would be faithful and loyal. I would listen to my child.

By high school, the town had grown considerably, but it was still a very small town vibe. I was a very late bloomer. I don't think I fully went through puberty until 14. I had a LOT of short (~6 mo) relationships over the course of HS and would have puppy-dog-crushes on EVERY girl. There were several who I got *close* to sleeping with, but I really had no idea how any of that worked and we just never sealed the deal.

When I got to college, I thought I had failed by not marrying my HS sweetheart. When I found a girl that reciprocated my affections, she was the first girl I ever slept with. I ""put a ring on it"" after 8 months and married her after knowing her a year and a half. While we didn't wait until we were married (and had a lot of shame about it) I felt a lot of pride in having married my ""first."" It was the right thing to do.

During the course of that relationship, I had started working at a major coffee chain to provide us with heath care. The group of people I worked with were some of my first close exposure to anyone on the LGBT spectrum. There were two ""out"" gay kids in my HS, but that was definitely outside the norm and it was a ""don't ask don't tell"" subject, even though I friends with one of them. When I started at the coffee shop, a person said they had gone to Pride that weekend and I asked which zoo it was at, thinking it was a special lion exhibit. 

After around 2 years, it came out that my wife had been cheating on me with a TA in her class and we divorced. [I'm not really upset about that anymore. Neither of us had any business together and we were never a good fit. Just two small town kids trying to do the ""right thing.""]

Thus began my ""wild oats"" phase. I hooked up with my ""Rachael,"" a girl that had always lead me on since forever, I had my first one night stand, I had casual relations with a friend that had also just gone though a divorce, I drank til the bars shut down, and had a really really good time.


[THE BALLAD OF BILLY JOE AND BOBBIE SUE]


Which brings us to about 8 years ago. I met my SO, we'll call her Sue, though common friends at work. She would come and hang out with us at the bars, and we would always flirt and have a good time. She seemed so open to the world, at least compared to what I had known. She didn't seem to care what people thought of her. She was edgy and dark. She liked true crime and smoked weed and was the exact opposite of everything I had ever gone for in a person. One night we ended up together. 

It was magnetic. It was passionate. It was the most deep and surreal connection I had ever felt with someone. I had a hard time walking the next day. We just got each other on some other level and have been practically attached at the hip ever since.

Sue knew I had rushed into my last major relationship and didn't want to repeat the same mistakes, but within 2 years we were living together, had traveled the country, and were known to always be down for a good time (we threw some of the most epic rager parties anyone has ever seen).

We were very open with each other sexually and always trying new things. We weren't awkward around each other even the slightest bit. I had found my best friend and my favorite person on earth. We laughed, we cried, we would argue but always make up, and we just grew so tightly together. Neither of us had good parental relationships modeled to us, so we had to teach each other how to communicate our feelings. 


[SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT]


Three years in, a little over 5 years ago, I was back at the coffee shop, working very early hours (4am - 1pm) and would get several hours alone before my SO got home. As I said, we had both been very open with trying new things in our sex life, and one of those things was me wearing her panties. It was just a spicy little thing we did. Well one day on a whim I decided to try on one of her bras. I can't really describe the feeling, it wasn't that it felt ""right"" it just felt ""good."" It felt a little dirty, and a little weird, but it definitely moved the needle for me.

A couple weeks later was Valentines Day. I didn't for a second thing she would judge me and I wanted to explore these feelings together, and I didn't want to hide anything from her. Spoiler alert: it did NOT go well. As such, I think I have blocked out a lot of it. But I know I did not look good. I was always a big burly guy with a big beard. I had a thick carpet of chest hair. I think I had a on a black ""corset"" kind of thing and some fishnets, it was all stuff from her underwear drawer.

She freaked out. I had imagined she would see me, we would meet in the middle of the room, and just go to town on each other like we always did. I'm fairly certain she cried.

The next few months were tough. She made it very clear she was not into it, but the more she resisted the more I realized it meant something to me. It wasn't something I could just stop, but I did go to it being very private. Only when she wasn't home. I never said I wouldn't, but I tried to be respectful of her not wanting to see it.

After a big fight about it, maybe 6-8 months in, we had a sit down on our back porch. I told her that it didn't make me gay, I'm not attracted to men, I just like feeling pretty some times. ""I'm not trans, but I am queer. I just don't know what that means at this point."" I had discovered r/cd, and while I participated and loved it, I didn't think ""crossdresser"" fully described the way I felt. But given my background, I just didn't have the vocabulary to describe it. I had no frame of reference. But I knew I was in some way ""queer,"" or just beyond the ""norm."" I knew it meant something to me.

But I persisted and would periodically be en femme when she got home from work. I would get dolled up in whatever mishmash of clothes she had that would fit me, clean the house with a glass of wine, and nervously wait for her to get home.

I look at my posts/comments from that time and see me trying DESPERATELY to convince myself I was getting somewhere with her. That it was ""rough"" but we were making it through. 

And maybe we were?

One night, she took me to walmart at midnight and helped me get a pair of cheap 1"" heels and I was over the moon. I couldn't WAIT to get home from work the next day and walk around in them. She started to come around to helping me get some clothes at the mall, but very basic stuff. Any time she made a bag for the goodwill, I would go thru it and pull out anything that fit me and tuck it away. My bottom drawer of my dresser became the sanctuary. She took me to get a pedicure with her, she would paint my nails, I thought I was getting through to her.

I wouldn't try to change my voice and I hadn't been clean shaven in 5 years. But she said she didn't like that I would ""act different."" Crossing my legs at the knee, being the little spoon. She had wrapped her head around the fact that I was ""a dude in a dress,"" but she didn't want me to change myself. Every time the ""dude in a dress"" comment came up, I would add that it was more to it than that, but I wasn't sure how to fully communicate that.


[JESUS, THIS IS TOO LONG]


I feel very lucky that through all of this I never had a ""purge."" Over the next few years I told a select couple of friends about my crossdressing. I went to the mall en femme a few times. I got more confident shopping for myself. I moved all my feminine undergarments out of my main underwear drawer into their own. I bought shoes from Payless online and frilly dresses from charlotte russe. I found more excuses to shave. I shaved my chest a few times.

Sue and I had a few times where she would go stay at her parents, but when we got back together we would establish new boundaries and move forward. I told myself things were getting better, I told myself she was coming around. I realize now I guess I was just forcing it on her and she was putting up with it.

But it did get normalized. 

I broke off ties with my family over unrelated toxicity, and she was there for me. We would travel, we started introducing each other as husband and wife even though we werent married. We were a unit. Outside of this very specific facet of our relationship we were extremely happy.

But I still felt the draw to be more public with it. I never thought I would ""come out"" because I didn't know what I would ""come out"" as, but I would shave my legs or get them waxed and wear shorts around people without fear.

We bought a house together 2 years ago. When we found out we were pregnant we really had a long and frank discussion of our ""options."" I remember driving to her parents house before we had told them, daydreaming about something, and I thought to myself ""wait, you can't do that, you're about to be a father."" And I started crying.

We had the baby late in 2016. During the pregnancy, the urgency to crossdress went down, but not fully away. I was desperately trying to find a new job and I remember a casting call for a TLC show about ""alternative families during their first pregnancy"" and brought it up to Sue. ""Oh, is that still a thing? I thought you were over that."" 

After the baby came, I continued to crossdress, but it felt like more than that. I really wondered if I was ""trans-trans."" So much of the common experience on the trans subreddits resonated with me, but I never felt like a ""woman trapped in a mans body."" I didn't feel like there was this ""old me"" I had to get rid of. But I wanted to be more outwardly feminine.

Late last year I saw a post about a person that felt just like me. I reached out in DM to ask if there were anywhere I could find more people like us and they pointed me to /r/nonbinary and /r/genderqueer. FINALLY. I found my people.

I realized that I just wanted to be a person. I wanted to participate in the ""girly"" stuff I wasnt allowed to growing up. I wanted to wear makeup. I wanted to occasionally wear dresses or girly things. But I wanted to stay the same person.

That month I had a breakdown and drove over 300 miles in the middle of the night after another big fight. When I got back in the morning, I broke down ugly crying and told Sue that I was genderqueer. I had finally found the word to describe how I felt. She seemed receptive, but noted it scared her not knowing my ""timeline or endpoint."" I started to look for and secured a therapist to start working thru all these things. 

And the more I explored ""NBness"" the more I realized it just described me as a person. In politics, religion, everything, I had always maintained there was nuance, there was no strict black and white.

The floodgates opened. I came out to her mom, who would watch our daughter when we were at work. I came out to more and more of my friends. Around Christmas I started playing with wearing some mascara to work and eventually came out to my department. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so supportive and understanding. 

I started presenting more femme at work, wearing full makeup on the two days a week I didn't go to the gym, and carrying a purse.


[THE BEGINNING OF THE END]


Christmas Eve. Hosting at our house for the first time. I'm out to her mom, but no one else in her family. For whatever fucking reason I decide to put on makeup. I think in my mind I was going to be the most gracious host that just HAPPENED to be wearing makeup. It was my opportunity to show that I'm the same person I've always been. And I blew it.

I don't know how it happened. I only remember pouring myself one drink, but I must have had a lot more because I have only VERY fuzzy memories of that night. I barely ever drink a full beer a night, much less get blackout drunk. I crashed out, woke up a few hours later, and started putting together my daughter's christmas presents. 

It wasnt until over a week later that Sue decided to fill me in on what happened. Apparently I had ruined a board game by being belligerent. I was being ""bitchy"" and generally just not a very fun person. I really really have no idea what the hell happened. Like I said, I got up after they left and put together gifts and such, I wasn't drunk then, and I got up very early the next morning and was not hung over.

But the cat was out of the bag. Sue had to try to explain to her 1970's NYC dad what the hell I was. No one would talk to me directly. We all got the flu and I was miserable both physically and mentally.

Her father met me for lunch when we had all recovered and I was delighted to find he had spent the week or two actually researching what 'non-binary' meant. We had a very frank and respectful conversation, although he did have one thing that struck me wrong: 

He said, ""if you start a relationship with a person and say, 'you should know I drink a beer every night and if you don't like that we shouldnt get together.' The other person agrees. Over the years, the first person starts drinking a six pack a night. And then a handle of vodka. The other person agreed to one beer, and they have the right to leave."" 

I understood what he was saying, but I was so delusional as to how much Sue really did support me. Even as I type out this ridiculously long post, I've skipped over many major fights on the subject. But I always saw the parts where she helped me and gave those more credence.

Sue was embarrassed about her mom seeing me go to work in makeup and more femme-presenting.

A month ago, she sat me down and said she had three things to say and that I needed to listen without giving input. She said: 

1) I am hurting people by doing what I'm doing

2) She wishes I was ""normal"" again

3) I don't think about how my daughter will be bullied because of me.

I tried to explain to her that I want to live a life of openness and honesty for my daughter. I never want to hide myself from her. And of course I've thought about her getting bullied because of me, but kids get bullied for a lot of reasons and I will work hard to give her the tools to deal with those situations when they arise.

Not satisfied with that, she went on to say that if I don't stop then I ""dont care about [my daughter].""

That hurt. A lot. I was very very upset. I was boiling but asked for space, went to the other side of the house, and took my frustrations out on a cardboard box in the recycling. She followed me, telling me ""youre a 30 year old man and should be able to handle it."" I walked past her repeating ""leave me alone leave me alone"" and she followed. Ironically, I ended up in my closet, huddled on the floor crying and screaming out for help. She mocked me. I started looking for my phone and when I found it I did the only thing I could think to do in my agitated state, I called the Crisis Hotline.

The woman on the other side of the phone talked me through breathing exercises. I told her what had happened. As I was on the phone, I sat against our bedroom door since it doesnt latch. After 20 minutes, Sue knocked and asked if she could come in. I said no, that I needed space, and she started trying to push her way in. She was on the phone with her mother and mocking how I was crying on the phone with someone. At one point she was pushing very hard against the door and said ""here's johnny."" 

I deduced she was going to take my daughter to her parents. I arranged to have the crisis call center call me back so I could call the police.

It was midnight on a Wednesday. It was raining. I was calmed down from my talk on the phone, so I was trying not to re-escalate the situation. I told her not to go, but I didn't try to grab her keys or stand behind the car or anything. The crisis center had told me she couldnt just take her so I felt calm in thinking the police would help. When I called them they laughed at me.

I was alone. 

And I've been alone ever since.

I have taken up WAY too much of everyones time here, so I'll spare everyone the details of the kind of toxicity I've been dealing with this month, but it hasnt been great.

I've had my daughter at our house overnight twice since then. I have taken her to the zoo and a museum, I've still gone to her doctors visits. But I mostly see her thru Facetime when Sue is okay with it.

I was informed Friday when I asked to see her this weekend that Sue had gotten a lawyer and wants to sell the house. I won't be allowed to see my daughter alone until after mediation is complete.

I'm so fucking lost and also never been more confident in who I am.

I have a really great friend from work that started after I was ""out"" and she's been such a huge support. I've reconnected with my old friends and met so many new friends.

I didn't get to see my daughter on easter weekend because I didnt give enough ""notice."" If I didnt have friends around itwould have been really tough. And I realized all the people I was hanging out with and having meaningful and thoughtful conversations with I had known less than a month.

I had to pay the mortgage and bills for the last month, and hadnt been reimbursed for bills for the month before she left. I am so unbelievably broke and busking for money to eat. 

I am up for a big promotion so I've had to go in on weekends and stay late.

I havent left my couch all day today. I don't even think I've turned on a light for more than a second.

I thought I was one of the lucky ones, but I realize thru my therapy that I've had my blinders on to all those times she wasn't supportive. And I really should have seen this coming.

I doubt very seriously anyone is going to read this, but thanks if you did.


TL;DR small town kid gets in touch with their femme side and it goes pretty okay until their entire life falls apart.


EDIT: formatting and spelling


EDIT 2: As if you need more to read, here is the contents of my ""coming out post"" I made the day after she left.


Dear World,
My name is [birth name]. I am not a freak. I am not a monster. I am a person. With hopes and dreams and fears and ambitions. I am also non-binary. What does that mean? It means I don‚Äôt let the shape of genitalia determine how I interact with the world. It means I don‚Äôt shove myself into a man shaped box or a woman shaped box. The shape of my body does not define my role in the world and does not preclude me from finding joy where I see it. In practice, I‚Äôve been experimenting with makeup and a more feminine expression in my clothing choices. I choose the middle path. It shouldn‚Äôt hurt you to hear this, and if it does you should ask yourself why. This has been a journey I found myself on over 5 years ago and it has not been an easy road. At times it has been very lonely and painful, but I find that most of that pain and anguish came from holding a part of myself back from the world. I come to praise [birthname], not to bury him. The label only serves to describe my feelings, but it does not define me. Only I define me. And I am [birthname]. The passionate, sympathetic, caring, and loving person I hope you‚Äôve always known me to be. I will not be held hostage by society. I will not be made to think I am ‚Äúless than.‚Äù I am the new normal: a world existing in and on a vast spectrum that ‚Äúblack‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite‚Äù couldn‚Äôt begin to describe. Join me or not, but I hope you will. ‚úåÔ∏èone love

"	"Wow.  That's quite a story.  I can relate to some of the core parts.  My wife is currently trying to take all of my kids away bc I am transitioning and bc of how embarrassing it will be for the kids.  At this point, I'm pretty sure I still have myself and my job.....everything else is a crapshoot except the certainty of losing my marriage.   I think at one point in life, I thought I was one of the lucky ones too.  The only comfort or solace I can offer you is the reassurance that you are not alone.
I read it through. I'm so sorry Sue can't understand you and can't see how not letting your daughter see you doesn't help her at all. Do you have any lawyer friends that you're discussing with about the situation?

You sound pretty amazing. üíï Thanks for sharing your story
Have you gotten your own lawyer? My understanding it that the longer you allow your daughter to lived away from you the harder it will be to get custody as a judge will not want to change her lifestyle/what she knows. Start the fight for custody rights *now.*
This was a sad post. Friend, I truly hope things get better for you and that you get to see your child more. I know it's not the same, but I've not seen my little sister in almost two years and I've yet to meet my youngest sister due to coming out to my mom.
>I realized that I just wanted to be a person. I wanted to participate in the ""girly"" stuff I wasnt allowed to growing up. I wanted to wear makeup. I wanted to occasionally wear dresses or girly things. But I wanted to stay the same person.

This resonates a lot with me. I‚Äôm agender, but I‚Äôm very fem, and this is a really good way of putting it into words the way I haven‚Äôt been able to.

Thank you, and you always have us as support.
:( im sorry about what happened with sue, it hurts so much to be in search for support in people you care about and not finding it, but from this post i get the impression that you can handle anything life throws at you. you are beautiful!!üíúüíú
I'm sorry to hear all that.

It sounds to me like you got to a point where you sort of had to force the issue that you are non-binary and she would have to be okay with that, but she isn't.

If you can't be together, I hope for everyone's sake that you and Sue can be adults about this.  I know that we hear many horror stories about how the family courts handle situations with divorcing couples with children, but you don't hear a lot about couples who divorce and then successfully co-parent afterwards.  I hope that you and Sue can come to an agreement to be able to parent together.

Some USA jurisdictions now have ""presumption of joint custody"" policies in place.  If you live in such a place, you are fortunate that you have the law on your side that Sue must make an affirmative case against you in order to take your daughter away.  In any case, /u/UVSky is right that you need to get in touch with a lawyer and learn about what the policies are in your jurisdiction and what you need to do to secure your right to parent your child moving forward.
That's a big story, and it deserves a big post. I'm so sorry.

But you know what? F*ck Sue and f*ck her family. You don't deserve that kind of hatred and toxicity in your life. I firmly believe everyone has the right to be happy and open about who they are. You are part of everyone.

Remember, this community is always here for you.
I'm honestly really sorry you had to go through this. Much love to you and thanks for sharing! 
Hey friend, I'm really sorry all of this  happened. You're incredibly resilient and you'll get through this mess too somehow.
you already fully went through puberty at only 14 and call yourself a late bloomer? ok.
Friend, that's neither here nor there.
Maybe I didn‚Äôt word that right. Like I didn‚Äôt ejaculate for the first time until I was 14 and I don‚Äôt think the mechanics had turned on until then. The things I‚Äôve heard about 9 yos humping everything or the 12 yo taking 1000 showers a week was never anything I experienced. 

Maybe it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúpuberty‚Äù but I just didn‚Äôt ‚Äúdiscover myself.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know it was supposed to do anything other than pee.
that's what the post said."	8an4qz	NonBinary	49	1.0	2018-04-08 02:32:31
Came out to a friend	"I met with a good friend of mine tonight, he is the pastor's son from the church I used to attend. 

I've always known him to be loving and accepting, but coming out as NB, and more specifically talking about my desire to appear more fem(I'm AMAB) and feeling zero judgment was amazing.

I have a lot of shame internalized about my identity from my religious childhood, but having him accept me for who I am, AND be happy for me to find my true self brings an overwhelming feeling of freedom and joy üíú"	Awh! I‚Äôm so happy to hear this!! The validation is such a nice feeling.	y673ml	NonBinary	48	0.98	2022-10-17 10:08:49
It‚Äôs interesting to think back on your childhood and see all the signs along the way that you were nonbinary or gender non-conforming; but you completely missed the signs in the moment‚Ä¶	"Today I was thinking back to when I wanted to be a skateboarder when I was a teenager. Somehow I convinced my conservative parents to let me dye my hair platinum blonde (like, nearly cloud white). Dressing like a skateboarder and dying my hair were the only rebellious things I could do at the time. I remember being so happy about my hair.

Thinking back now, decades later, I was so happy because I got to do something feminine with my hair by dyeing it a new color; even though I didn‚Äôt know the exact reason at the time. I just knew it felt great to have my hair dyed.

Also, I am super thankful to the hair dresser my folks found. We lived in a very rural, incredibly conservative, really small town at the time. Looking back on my interactions with that hair dresser, I‚Äôm pretty sure he was queer. At least, those are the vibes I can see now, decades later, but completely missed at the time.

I wonder if he knew he was helping bring joy to a queer kid; even though that kid, and their folks, didn‚Äôt know that at the time‚Ä¶ it makes me smile to think that he did know. I hope he‚Äôs doing well."	"Just had another memory about the hair dresser: I remember him telling my mom that ‚Äúoh yeah, all the boys are dyeing their hair.‚Äù And then giving some excuse about it being popular or about skating or something‚Ä¶
I am seriously tearing up thinking that this hair dresser went to bat for me, just so I could get my hair dyed. He had to have known.
I knew... Unfortunately at a vulnerable and confusing time for me I was told ""I'd be okay if you were gay but I don't know about being transgender"". So that kind of fucked me up for a good decade.
Yes, lol, I literally wore a rainbow backpack with ""trans"" written on the back (brand) for years before I realized.
I‚Äôm a bit opposite- I don‚Äôt see a bunch of signs in things I did or wanted. I think I was really preoccupied with other things. Having never really developed who I was tho made total sense for a gender crisis at 23 lmfao
Others do have a sixth sense for sure, and you're meant to bump into people along the way in life, for me it was looking back and noting I liked spending more time with the girls than the boys as well as playing netball in primary school rather than soccer or anything the boys played...I've always been a non binary masc girl, just now my body is catching up finally thanks to hrt
That little story made me rly happy :)

It‚Äôs the little things...	"I had to get a prescription filled today for a new medication and to my complete surprise the pharmacy had updated everything to be under my chosen name (my insurance is still under my legal name though) so all my pill bottles now say Noah and the pharmacy refers to me as Noah. When I saw the prescription bottle with my chosen name on it I burst into tears of joy.

I just thought I would share some of my joy with you fine people! Hope everyone is having a wonderful day!"	"Wow that's so cool! How did you update that with them? Through your dr?
Damn, that's awesome! I hope that sticks! 
I‚Äôm assuming what happened was my psychiatrist just sent the prescriptions under my chosen name by accident and the pharmacy went with it since my legal name is noted in the system as well? I didn‚Äôt like ask or anything, because I didn‚Äôt want them to think it was an error since everything went smoothly with my two names thing lol. Sorry I‚Äôm not much help.

This is amazing! However the joy of this is negated by the shitty comments.		"saying that they (they use they/them) shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to play in the WNBA. Makes me sick that people are so ignorant to the fact that they are discussing another persons rights and what they should and shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to do. Please lmk if this is too much of a rant. Would like to hear other opinions or solutions or anything at all. Also the video is great !
Basically should gender be apart of sports ? Personally I don‚Äôt think so but lmk your thoughts
Trans while sporting debate has potentially slightly traumatized me. The ‚Äúonline left‚Äù/breadtube had a meltdown over this the last time it came up and there is just too much in it. I literally cannot see why someone would say a player shouldn‚Äôt play sports if they haven‚Äôt been on/made ‚Äútoo much of‚Äù their own T. Like that is based on nothing. It‚Äôs just purely transphobic. Honestly most of it is just transphobic. But I feel it- this is why I cannot read the comments.
No. Cis men do not get stopped by things like gender segregation when they want to creep.
Yea I read the comments and I now regret it, I‚Äôve tried arguing with transphobes and they make me angy I wish people had some compassion, like you‚Äôre talking about a person whose actions and life choices won‚Äôt affect you. People are dumb and I find that it‚Äôs really difficult to make the dumb people understand that it‚Äôs not about an athletes performance in the sport they‚Äôre playing it‚Äôs about their gender and what they do for sports should not be affected by that unless the person themselves decide to change that. At the end of the day I feel that it‚Äôs just going to take time and that sucks but in my little perfect world I imagine there being no gender segregation at all and just people living together as people. Thank you for listening to my rant I appreciate this space and I appreciate all of you in this subreddit you are all very cool and niceüòä
Yea but that shouldn‚Äôt constrain people who aren‚Äôt creeps right? Like I feel that if someone is creeping or being gross then they should be removed or kicked out. Punish the people offending isnstead of the people being offended"	lc5mh1	NonBinary	45	1.0	2021-02-04 02:49:44

I am falling hard	"I've always struggled with relationships,, and meeting people who fully embraced my wee lil non-binary self- but I have met the most incredible person and I couldn't be happier. 

They make me feel like the king I am, make me feel so seen in my gender and are just the absolute cutest thing in the world.

It has been a battle trying to find someone who will accept me for who I am- I really hope they stay in my life for a long time :,)

Sending love to all you pals out there- I hope the universe brings this love and joy to all of you too <3"	"Woohooooo! That‚Äôs beautiful ü§©

Gender euphoria is a hell of a drug	"So, if you look at my posting history, you can see I'm going through the cliche post-egg-cracking crisis. ie, ""Wait, was this dysphoria? Was THAT dysphoria? Why are so many of these trans narratives so damn relatable?"" (Answers: yes, probably, and because some nonbinary people are also trans)

But I want to share something that might be helpful to other people starting their journey: dysphoria sucks, and while going down the rabbit hole of your past is kind of a necessary part of the process, it's extremely stressful and draining. 

But you know what's AMAZING? Gender euphoria. So I decided that I'm going to try to focus on what gives me that feeling, and let that be my guide. I started making a list of things that give me gender euphoria, as well as a list of things that I think might do so. I'm AFAB and really only now exploring my ""male"" side, so a lot of these are pretty masculine-coded:

**Things that give me male or non-binary gender euphoria:**

* Being referred to by ""they/them"" pronouns. (wowowowow, I did not expect this to feel so euphoric. I thought I didn't care about pronouns. I was wrong.)
* How my broad shoulders and small-ish boobs look in men's button-down shirts.
* Wearing this one button-down shirt that, due to the cut, makes me look flat-chested when I wear it. (THIS was a surprise)
* Man-spreading instead of sitting with my legs together (have only done this at home, not on the subway!)
* The fact that my speaking voice is low but my singing voice is a high soprano (very non-binary!)
* Connecting with other non-binary people, or binary trans people in early stages of transition, and feeling really connected to them.
* My big, blocky glasses

**Things I want to try:**

* Interested in binding, but going to start with a small sports bra
* Packing? (this seems scary but also really ... interesting)
* Wearing men's underwear
* Cutting my hair short (it's long and blonde and immediately marks me as a feminine woman)

Then I wanted to honor my female side, so I thought about **gender euphoria I've gotten from female things:**

* Female friendships, and feeling community with women, especially queer women
* Sometimes I love my girly hair
* Listening to good, feminine pop music, like Janelle Monae.

One of the cool things about exploring this way is that I've discovered I like things I never would have expected, like being referred to by certain pronouns, or how my shoulders look in a button-down. It's a really joyful and fun way to explore something that can be really heavy and scary. 

What gives you gender euphoria?"	"I'm AMAB and I'm discovering similar things as you lately.  I can relate with referring to they/them.  But I'll tell you what's been giving me so much relief lately is the fact that I shop in the women's section for bath products.  

I also wear light earth tones, enjoy having long hair and wear more femme glasses.  It feels amazing knowing that I can present however I want to.  Embracing the genderqueer/nonbinary label for me has meant letting go of so much shame that came with being a feminine man.  I don't even have to be ""man"" in any sense of the word and it feels great.

EDIT: The best part of all of this is that I do not have to hold myself to anybody's expectations.  It feels good.
EEE this post is so relatable honestlyyy

&#x200B;

I fricken loove my clothesss!! For the past 3 years i've subconsciously been buying androgynous clothes and i look BOMB in them!! They're all 80's aesthetic so hell yeahh
I completely relate to the whole ""Wait, was that dysphoria?"" thing, that was like the whole past year for me, looking back at most of my life. I haven't had many gender euphoric moments so far, unfortunately, since most of my dysphoria is based around my body and social stuff. I'm on HRT, low dose, and it's working slow. So my body isn't that different and people don't really view/treat me different yet. One thing that did make me euphoric, was hearing my kids use my proper pronouns in an excited and happy way. My wife and I took our kids to an outlet store and we split up to look at some stuff (I'm always in the kitchen isle) and I heard a little voice say ""There they are!"" and then a chorus of enthusiastic shouts and yells and saw my kids waving at me from a shopping cart across the store. That made my heart leap and put a smile on my face, which honestly isn't a feeling I get around gender all that much.
I like being referred to as they/them too! Painting my nails is good as well, and I wanna shave my legs but that would raise too many parental eyebrows :(

As far as music goes, Purity Ring gives me that feeling, oddly enough. Maybe cuz it's got badass instrumentals and super feminine vocals
I was experiencing dysphoria around my name for *years* without knowing it. It wasn‚Äôt until I found the name Parker and experienced ‚Äúoh. That me! I love that name! Why didn‚Äôt I know using a name I love could feel so good?‚Äù that I realized what gender euphoria really felt like. 

I almost cried when my friends sang happy birthday to Parker last week. 

Also: A short haircut. 

Growing body hair. I didn‚Äôt realize what a radical choice growing my body hair would be, but. Damn. I‚Äôm still getting used to even going out in public with armpit and leg hair. It‚Äôs a little scary.
AFAB

My man shoulders and narrow hips

When my male friends greet me as one of the dudes. ( I was honestly ecstatic)

Buying men's clothes or perusing the mens section. 

Putting on contour to highlight my masculine jaw and adding shadows to my face. 

Wearing boxer briefs at home !

Manspreading on the train. 

Walking out in my new menswear. 

Ive just about explored all my femininity that it doesn't give me euphoria but I love having longish nails and getting them done.

I love my long curly hair I'll never cut it .
I love showing off my fit body  and smallish curves

I didn't know there was a name for that feeling !
Can I ask why the voice thing is very non-binary? I'm very similar but don't totally understand the connection.
I have a button down shirt that I love wearing and usually wear for my androgynous selfies
Being referred to by they/them, being called a darling, people at my local gaming club joking about me being immune to the old he or she printings of cards in Magic The Gathering, that second look my hair gets in the loos, and seeing myself in the mirror stepping out of the shower and having wet hair sorta spilling down my chest in that way what happens to women in most every movie.

That is so awesome!! I have also been finding the same thing - I used to feel awkward about the ways I wasn‚Äôt feminine *enough* and embracing my more masc side in a proactive way is really healing.
That sounds rad. :)
Oh my gosh, that is so unbelievably sweet. It‚Äôs great that your family loves you so much as you are!
And what a great example for your kids.
Wow, I‚Äôm old and feeling comforted that kids still listen to Purity Ring, lol.
purity ring are so good
I haven‚Äôt shaved my legs for years (being blonde helps) but I think you‚Äôve inspired me to not shave my pits this summer. :)

I am just now realizing I may have some mild dysphoria around my name. I‚Äôve never identified strongly with it, partly because it‚Äôs extremely common in my generation (there were 4 in my elementary grade of 70) but also because it is VERY feminine.
It's a great concept! 

I love my wide shoulders now. And a friend called me bro yesterday and it made me so happy.
It‚Äôs probably just in my head, but I love that there‚Äôs this split. I have sung pretty seriously at several points in my life, and people always assume I‚Äôm an alto. It kinda delights me to be able to bust out with a Soprano I. I feel like it reflects the two sides of my gender identity.
Button downs are so good for gender euphoria if you're AFAB!
yeah they're super cool! my boi blank banshee sampled one of their live performances on his first album too, it's cool to see amazing artists inspire each other
will wtf i didn't expect to see you here! it's luke from the soundcloud twitter community lmao. your remix of textile fucks
Oh, that makes a lot of sense! I get that too.
Hahaha I haven‚Äôt even heard of that person (because old) but that‚Äôs great!
yeah ty! I‚Äôm still questioning atm but it‚Äôs really cool to see other people I know from other places online in this sub and r/traaa!!

"For an nb that does not id as trans male at all (I'm afab) I sure do get a lot of joy out of being misgendered as male lmfao anybody else relate?? Like when ppl be like ""excuse me sir"" I'm like üòå‚ò∫Ô∏èüòã is that weird??"	"lmao idk why I think it just makes me happy when ppl dont think I'm a girl even if they still get it wrong it's like at least u were wrong in the other direction hahaha yall feel me? I have another nb friend that is amab that said smth once abt how they enjoyed being misgendered as a woman even tho they arent a trans woman so I was just curious if other ppl feel this way too

Like obviously it's way preferable for ppl to just not assume any gender at all and that makes me the happiest but still idk I just get a kick out of it I'm like hell yea haha"	"i definitely feel this way. it's a mixed happiness for me because it's like yay they didn't think i'm a woman but then oh no they think i'm a guy. it's a conflicted happy feeling but i still find joy from it nonetheless
I mean, if people are calling you pronouns opposite to your assigned gender at birth then it means you are passing as not your AGAB which is what you want. I personally feel huge dysphoria with female pronouns etc and I'm AFAB, but I'm not a trans guy, I feel most euphoric when I see people looking kinda confused or not knowing how to refer to me, but as I'm aiming for a more masc appearance I love being called 'son' as is the local way to refer to young guys around here. So I call myself transmasc as well as enby but sometimes the labels can be dizzying. I am not a girl 100% no have never been, the thought is repulsive, but transitioning into a guy fully also wouldn't be right for me! Hope that makes some sense!
you can call yourself transmasc if you want, or whatever. do what makes you comfortable. our current gender system is oppression.

i do believe that this, from a psychological standpoint, just proves that you are enby, because being misgendered in the ""wrong direction"" as you said, is better than being misgendered as your birth gender. we feel happier to not be gendered as our birth gender, so even if it's not ""your"" gender, it's still better than the one you've been misgendered as all your life, feel me ?
Same, I've always felt better about being mistaken for a boy (not my AGAB) and gotten a kick out of it, exactly for the reason that at least it's a change of pace.

The only time I don't like it when someone feels afraid/wary of me for thinking I'm a man. I work in a small place where we have two tiny changing rooms. I'm mostly not out, so I change in the women's changing room. For the first week the only woman co-worker would always go to the bathroom to change and I just figured she was shy, until when talking about names, it came out that I'm non-binary and AFAB when she had thought I was a gay boy. She was ok with changing in my presence after that. She must have thought I was rude/awful at social rules for the first week!
(But it also felt pretty cool that I was able to be confusing for that long! And she really liked me as a co-worker so now she has a nice experience of someone non-binary.)

I always joke that if I had to be seen as a binary gender I'd want men to think I'm a man and women to think I'm a woman. That way everyone would think I'm ""one of them"" and treat me with camaraderie. And I could be gay either way.
Trust me, it‚Äôs perfectly normal
i understand this completely! i have on rare occassions been gendered by strangers as a girl and its kinda fun?? like i know its very unlikely a stranger will look at me and guess ""oh that person is nonbinary"" so just being pegged as ""not my assigned gender"" is a victory in its own right
r/egg_irl made me realise this lol
I actually have been questioning my gender for over half my life, have been quite a tomboy, androgynous, and the first time I got mistaken for a boy was at church! Right after I had gotten my first shorter haircut, and have been chasing the euphoria high for ages. I sometimes get mistaken for a hot when I'm out in full boy mode and it's really awesome. So nope! Completely not alone!
Hell yeah. It doesn‚Äôt happen nearly enough. :(
Not weird at all. I'm an amab enby and I get happy when I'm misgendered as ""she""
literally, no. ""normal"" means ""of the norm"". enbies are not normal. we are a tiny minority.
I mean normal among enbies

I ordered my first chest binder!!!	I'm so overjoyed and nervous at the same time. I'm crying so much. This means the world to me. I hate having a big chest, and this will just help me so much!  I can't wait until it comes in the mail. I paid for faster shipping even!  But ugh. I cannot stress enough how this brings me joy.	"Aah, I'm so happy for you, friend! I ordered mine as well and it's supposed to ship this week and I understand that wait is so nerve wracking. I hope yours arrives fast and you can start rocking that flat chest look!
 It's soooooo nerve wracking!  Omg!  But I'm nervous people are gonna point it out or stare. I'm only out to my oartber and to my best friend. Everyone else doesn't know.
As long as you're feeling good, it doesn't matter what others think! It's not their business. And if they ask questions, you can just tell them you're trying out some new looks! They don't need to know the depths of your life ;)
I was also really nervous about people noticing and pointing it out before I got my binder. I have a pretty big chest, so I was really worried people would ask questions that I wouldn't know how to answer. (I'm only out to my siblings and friends) But since getting my binder, not a single person has mentioned it! I don't know if they've noticed or not, but they at least haven't said anything about it

I can't say whether or not your experience will be the same, but I hope this can help your nerves a bit!
Honestly probably nobody will asks questions or even mention it. I bought my first binder 4 months ago and nobody, really nobody said something. Ok one friend asked if I had lost weight. She said my face and my chest looks thinner. And yes I lost weight but my chest was  flatter because of the binder hahah
This is very heart warming to me and helps! Thank youüåª"	sxl20d	NonBinary	40	0.98	2022-02-21 04:57:29
I'm so tired... TW bigotry, brief mention of sexual abuse		"It really is tiring having to educate people so often (and so extensively)

You did great, by the way üß°
The way you remained calm and civil during this brutal combo is impressive. Stay strong!
This person you‚Äôve texted sounds exactly like my mom. I also get so exhausted from trying to talk to her about this stuff, she‚Äôs so clueless and close-minded. She also seems convinced that I turned trans because of abuse or that I‚Äôll regret it and want to detransition. I admire how you handled this interaction, but I wish you didn‚Äôt have to deal with this in the first place
I think you handled it really well! And regarding people detransitioning- the vast majority are people who stop pursuing transition because of safety or cost, a smaller percent do because they felt they weren‚Äôt trans.
You are so brave. Part of why I‚Äôm still mostly closeted is bc I‚Äôm afraid of moments like this happening. My family is ridiculously homophobic but that‚Äôs nothing compared to their transphobia and ignorance of nonbinary people that‚Äôs on top of their religiosity and other issues that I‚Äôm currently in therapy for lol.
I hope this doesn‚Äôt happen to anyone else
Thank you ‚ù§

I was consulting with my best friend in real time lol
Yeah... i keep her in my life because it feels like she's at least willing to try but like... idk anymore
I was gonna say, some of this is the exact same thing my mom says (except with other issues, not trans.)
There's just certain things and ideas she just can't seem to let go of. She keeps trying to filter it through her ken instead of realizing it's a completely different paradigm that she's gonna have to accept. (I'm talking from experience with my own mom here, because so much of that conversation feels like ones I've had with my mom.)

Sometimes you just have to give up on it (either by not talking about it or not having them in your life anymore/limiting their access to you/putting boundaries around your interactions), sadly, for your own health. Those who really DO want what's best for you will at least try to accept that, or will agree to have a truce. It sucks SO much and it hurts for us too (I have to be limited contact with my mom, and no contact with my dad. I get it.)

THAT being said...

To explain the gender things a little better, maybe the the following.

Say to grandma, instead of ""I'm not the gender I'm assigned a birth, I don't feel like AGAB,""  say... ""Grandma, what if you were you, just like you are now, but everyone who met you insisted you weren't a guy or a girl? Insisted on calling you a neutral name, using they/them pronouns for you. What if we all called you ""grandparent"" instead of ""grandma"", told you that you were wearing the wrong clothes (that you should be wearing androgynous clothes)? What if you tried to go into the women's restroom and people were shocked & frightened at the worst, and said you were in the wrong restroom at best? How would that feel to you, right now, with who you are right now?""  (Or if you think it would work better with using ""they insisted you were a guy"" do that. I just used neutral because of your gender so she could get that concept better.)

Many cis people can't imagine themselves wanting to be another gender, but putting it in terms of ""you are your gender, but no one sees it or recognizes it or will treat you that way""  not only can they more easily understand that, but in some ways and/or for some folks that's actually closer to the reality of us trans and/or enby, etc. folks.

Good luck, friend."	xntm8j	NonBinary	36	0.95	2022-09-25 17:33:47

I'm exploding with joy and just need to share it	"Hey you wonderful people. After 10 years of unhappiness with my body I've finally managed to accept that I'm not going to ""grow out"" of it. After months of anxiously feeling like I'm not trans enough to be actually trans, I've realized I'm non binary and that that's okay too.

I'm still confused about a lot of stuff, but I'm just so filled with contentment. I'm a person happy with my vagina and unhappy with my breasts. I want a deeper voice but I don't want facial hair. I want to wear dresses and suits and have a more gender neutral name. I don't care what pronouns I'm called, I don't care what people think I am. And for the first time none of these feelings come with shame or confusion. 

I've scheduled a consultation with a cosmetic surgeon and plan to get top surgery next spring. I've been buzzing with happy energy all week. Every time I look down at my chest the usual dysphoria sets in, but it's being drowned it by impatience and excitement. I can't wait to feel and look how I want to. I can't wait to shop in the boys section. I can't wait to be actually happy with how I look.

After surgery I don't know what will come next. Maybe I'll be happy then. Maybe I'll actually change my name. Maybe I'll publicly stay a flat chested girl forever. I don't know. But I know that I'm really happy to start becoming who I want to be, whoever that is <3 

Thank you all for your part in helping me realize who I am <3 <3 <3"	"That's awesome! I'm in a similar place and have been struggling with that for years. I'm okay with my small breasts but I kind of wish I was male downstairs and often wear a prosthetic in private. I'm neutral to facial hair and I love dresses on occasion and gender neutral t-shirts and button-down dude shirts. I've had a child and I don't regret it. It was nice being a womb haver and being able to use it. And I love my hairy hairy legs. So I've always been a bit conflicted. But once I accepted myself and felt so much better. Congratulations on feeling more like yourself! That's so important.

I have to tell you guys the cutest story about my son	"So I identify as Enby/gender fluid and I'm AFAB, (I am also pan/poly sexual) and I'm married to a cis-het man. My son is 10 and I'm trying to raise him to be respectful of differences, and just to normalize them. We played the Game of Life yesterday (the one with the little cars and the pink and blue people) and when we got to the married space, without batting an eye my son said, ""Who do you want to marry mom, a man or a woman?"" It was freaking awesome. We're still working on gender identities as I only came out publicly this year and I'm not sure he fully understands yet and yes, the game would be so much better with an alternate gender option, but it just filled me with such joy that he asked me! #parentingwin"	"Sounds like you're doing it right! You should be proud!
You're doing great! Give your son a head pat for me :)
Thanks üòä"	imkbmg	NonBinary	38	0.96	2020-09-04 17:29:45
My 4-year old cousin told me I'm pretty	"Okay so this happened last year at a christmas party in the school that I go to; which I was looking forward to because I stylized and repurposed my own party/event outfits (been doing it since I came out.)

I got an old shirt and turned it into a crop top, Used some high waist shorts and combat boots to match (also with nets). I saved up money for having my makeup done by professional makeup artist since I really can't do make-up for nuts and I wanna look as pretty as possible.

A few hours before the event I got ready for the party. I ironed out my clothes, organized my accessories, and hid it in my secret space. Even though I came out way back in 2018, my family still isn't fond of the whole ""dressing up"" thing, so the clothes and the makeup session is done in secret. 

After all the prep is done, the outfit on my body and the makeup on my face (which, by the way, is done BEAUTIFULLY. Highlight to the gods, Electric blue glitter eyeshadow fantasy, all the biz.) , I went home to get my stuff. The whole family is there, which is NOT good for my anxiety. They had this LOOK. You know, *THE LOOK*. The look of Disapproval and resentment. THE LOOK. Lots of them had things to say like ""that's too much make-up."" ""you're still a boy."" ""Don't be too loud."" 

I felt really really small when my uncle asked if I really had to do this, like it was unnecessary for me to feel good about myself and feel valid. 

Then, this little bundle of joy named Elizabeth, youngest daughter of the said Uncle, age 4, just looked at me with sparkling eyes, looking up at me like I saved the world. With a grin, and amazement in her voice, she gleefully shouted ""Anon's so pretty!!!"" and I said to myself ""this is it. Those three words are the reason why I'm still fighting."" I never got so much adoration and acceptance, let alone from a child who lived in a world where elders say girls should wear pink skirts and boys, blue pants. 

and I loved Eliz for that. I might have held back tears so my eyeliner doesn't run.

For people with the same struggle, just know that I am here to be your Elizabeth. I am here-- adoring you and loving you. You are beautiful. Whatever you are, you're valid. I am here as a safe space for all the people who felt like their home isn't a safer place. I am here. I hear you. I feel you. I adore you for being so brave. I love you all."	"Awww :)  I can't stop smiling, that's so cute <3 I almost cried reading the second part :) this is the kind of things that could save any bad day :) (ps : I'm sure your makeup was wonderful <3)

In memory of Near/Byuu (CW: Suicide)	"Hi friends,

So as some of you may have heard, Near aka Byuu was a nonbinary and autistic developer behind BSNES and Higan, both incredibly important parts of gaming emulator history. 

They were driven to suicide by a harassment campaign from K*wifarms, targeted specifically for being nonbinary and autistic. This isn't the first time K*wifarms has been the impetus behind suicide, either. Prior to Near, Julia Terryberry and Chloe Sagal took their own lives after being targeted. Julia was autistic, Chloe was trans. 

I know this community is largely for self-expression and joy, but I think it's important we recognize and remember those we've lost. None of us deserve to live with hatred for who we are, and none of us should be driven into dark places because of that. 

Places like K*wifarms need to be uprooted. We have to ask our representatives to regulate against hate, we have to demand companies (in this case, DreamHost and CloudFlare) stop offering service to hate groups, and for society to create and offer better support for those targeted. 

I don't have any actionable links, but if you're on Twitter or up for writing an email, please write to your reps or tweet at the companies who can at least do some basic work to remove K*wifarms as a viable centre for hate organization. 

As a relevant article, despite the exceptionally softball headline: https://kotaku.com/the-brilliant-snes-emulator-creator-known-as-near-has-d-1847182851

Edit: Autocorrect flubbed DreamHost. Corrected."	"And now this from dreamhost in the last 48 hours

The fact that BBC asked our local TV to use both female and male language to refer to the Doctor fills me with secret enby joy	"I'm brazilian. Portuguese is one of those languages that not only have pronouns, but also gendered articles and, well, gendered everything (for an instance, a keyboard is male while a computer screen is female, I know that because of the articles I use with each of those inanimate objects). So a person's job/title must always agree with the gender. Doctor is a job/title. When the 13th Doctor came into being the original translation for the title character in Doctor Who went from being O Doutor to A Doutora (those ""o"" and ""a"" are the gendered articles I mentioned). 

But now the BBC said the official translation must always use the male version. 

Cis fans are panicking ""It's offensive to call her O Doutor because it's male and she's a woman!"". 

I'm kinda overjoyed. The Doctor as an enby icon is absolutely my jam and also headcanon. It makes me want to watch the series dubbed just so I see people referring to the Doctor as male and female in the same sentence \^\^"	"I love it! It's hard to find a middle ground in gendered languages but when there isn't a good option a confusing one is great too. üòÅ

I'm AMAB NB and I'm Taking Ballet	"Being non-binary and taking ballet don't have to go together, but, in my case, they do.  Ballet has been a sort of moving meditation for me, a time when I can focus on exploring my body beyond its masculine trappings (ballet, in and of itself, has no gender or gender requirements, but, to me, finding a place to be liberated from the ungraceful, somewhat aggressive form of masculinity I grew up with is a joy).  I'm not a dancer in any way, shape, or form, but doing this has really opened up the way I perceive myself.  I've been writing about it here:

And, if you're so inclined to read on, I'd be grateful!  Thank you for listening!"	"Yesssss. I ran a queer ballet group in college and have since fallen in love with ballet as a tool for libration! 

If you have a sec, check out Ballez- a professional queer ballet group that seems super aligned with what you're discovering. 
Ballet was first how I got in to dance and started the reaction that led to me really thinking/feeling about my gender!!

Coming out responses	"I‚Äôm in my 40s and have been coming out this week.  Slowly, over text, just to friends.  It‚Äôs been mostly positive I think, but while almost everyone is saying supportive things, it‚Äôs mostly filled with ‚ÄúI support you, but I‚Äôm not even going to pretend that I understand what these terms mean‚Äù.  ‚ÄúYou have my love and support, but I‚Äôm old and need time to process all these new words in the world‚Äù

And then I barely hear from anybody again at all.

I‚Äôm not feeling lonely or sad.  Proud and strong would be better words, but I just want to thank younger queers for continually pushing the gender envelope.  I don‚Äôt know why older folks who grew up with David Bowie and Prince and Freddie Mercury have no clue what I‚Äôm talking about - but a lot of it is because we didn‚Äôt have the worlds or language to discuss it, and there was a lot of hate.  External and internal.

I love you all.  As I begin to come out more and more I‚Äôd be interested in hearing the positive and negative responses you‚Äôve gotten - particularly professionally and from older people.

Finally.  Love your bodies - whichever ones you have or will have.  Explore them, cherish them, touch them.  You are all so beautiful.  I know we may all present and feel very differently from each other, but that‚Äôs the joy of being queer.  Seeing and feeling beauty where others don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt.

As someone in their early 50s who is still trying to figure things out, I can totally relate to this message. I have been so impressed by the way that young people are pushing the gender envelope. And, to be honest, I'm also a bit envious. But mostly impressed and grateful for these powerful examples of courage. 
Thank you.  I suppose it‚Äôs hard to get upset at people who think ignorance is a badge of honour, but just as hard not to!


On one hand the knowledge of a gender spectrum predates all of us - and therefore we can look to history for some lessons on the aspects of our humanity our ancestors discovered. 

On the other, this knowledge has been forgotten or discarded by modern society, so we have to look to the future and young people to help discover and unveil this side of humanity.

Being in the middle, it seems the former is useful for information, but the latter is useful for hope.   I suppose both are necessary for change.

Absolutely.  

In hundreds of cultures, for thousands of years; there have been more than 2 genders - but in colonized countries, like mine, everyone is taught 2 as a law from the moment they can hear - and never hear of anything different.

Sharing some mutual trans joy I experienced today	"Hey all, wanted to share this happy moment in transness that happened today. I was out hiking solo, in a new area -- one that's not necessarily conservative, but not familiar to me, so a little added caution. I'd worn a sweater over my Protect Trans Kids shirt, and it was getting warm... so I took off the sweater. ...And I started getting a little anxious. The voice in my head was scared ""Is that guy gonna punch me? He's staring a lot. What if these people hate me?""

And then out of nowhere, on a narrow part of the trail, I pass a family of two parents and their kid. The kid (maybe 12ish?) got super excited and shrieked, ""I love your shirt!!"" and I was just so happy. I said thanks, and then decided that was the universe telling the anxious voice in my head that I was safe. And I hope that kid felt safe too. Yay."

Stop asking if you look like you suit your name	"I don't say this as an attack or with any malice. I say this to mean, it's your name and all that matters is that you like it and think it suits you! Being non-binary is already such a rejection of what others think of you and is all about owning your own expression. Especially when it comes to changing your name as I would think the whole point is to abandon one that was picked out for you for one that you picked. Also we are only ever seeing one picture of you in one look, we can't possibly get a good understanding of who you are as a person. Definitely not as good as you yourself would have.

So who cares what some strangers think on the internet about if your name suits you. Does it satisfy your gender expression and bring you joy? Then that's all that matters!"		zg1ww9	NonBinary	30	0.9	2022-12-08 15:21:02
My province accepted a civil right law to include non-binary pronouns in governmental documentations	"My whole facebook feed exploded in joy, I thought you might enjoy a bit of good news.

My province, a heavily catholic province (Quebec), passed a law that trans people and non-binary people can now change all of their documentation to match their gender identity. Documents includes, changing the gender on the birth certificate, medical card or whatever documents you have to the identity you identify as.

It includes M, F and X.

Non-binary parents can also mention themselves as 'parent' instead of 'mother' or 'father' on their kids' birth certificate.

Teenagers also do not require a letter from a medical/psychological professional anymore to apply for changing their gender officially. Parents can still deny a name change though.

This law also applies to non-Canadian citizens, like refugees, permanent residents and people without status.

The argument was that not including those rights was removing rights to trans and non-binary people and would only cause harm to citizens that are as important and valid as anyone else.

Requiring therapy or HRT to perform a top surgery is BULLSHIT	"I‚Äôm agender. I have wanted to get these fat sacks off of my chest for over a decade but could only just recently afford it. When I started looking for plastic surgeons near me, I came to realize that EVERY SINGLE ONE of them required at least a year of therapy (and the therapist‚Äôs referral) or being on hormones (and the doctor‚Äôs referral). And that‚Äôs whether you plan to file through insurance or not.  

Are you fucking kidding me? I WILL NOT be told I have to have *anyone‚Äôs* permission to make changes to MY body. I know myself. I‚Äôve known I wanted to get rid of these annoyances on my chest since I was 15. I am beyond livid that NB/trans people would have to explain themselves to anyone. 

I finally found a surgeon 4 hours away that practices informed consent and believes people when they say they would be happier with or without certain body parts. I‚Äôm scheduled to have my surgery this summer (when I have some scheduled time off work). 

This whole experience has really taken away from the joy and excitement I should have been able to feel about finally having my procedure done. Anyone else deal with this BS?"	"That‚Äôs such bullshit. I‚Äôm really glad you found a sane doctor!

I had something...weird happen. As background, my mom (who I‚Äôm no contact with) had top surgery when I was a teenager, and we still have the same family doctor. 

I had very heavy breasts (seriously my surgeon was like ‚ÄúYeah, your breasts weren‚Äôt *all* that big, but they were really heavy!‚Äù

I asked for a referral for a breast reduction because they were fucking up my already fucked up back. Aside from pooh-poohing the idea that it would help (shocker: removing three pounds from my chest *did* help!) and being generally unhelpful, he was like ‚ÄúOh, is this because of your ‚Äòfamily history‚Äô?‚Äù

Me, genuinely confused: What?

Dr: Well she got top surgery...

Me, sweating in secret!transmasc but also pissed because my fucking back and shoulders hurt all the fucking time: What? N-No, this has nothing to do with gender! üòÖ

He finally gave me a referral. I freaked out that the plastic surgeon would think I wanted the reduction (covered) was for gender reasons (not covered) so I dressed SUPER femme. 

She just looked at them, held them, and was like whooooo these babies gotta go!
Totally agree that it's fucked up! 

In my country, if you want chest surgery through public health care (and thus pay like almost nothing) it would require an offical diagnosis of gender dysphoria. But it seems that private practising plastic surgeons don't have therapy or hormone requirements. You just have to pay the fucking price... Which I will most likely do, since gender dysphoria assessment is a lengthy process and waiting list are up to 2 years. And honestly, I don't need an assessment to tell that the fat sacks (love your wording there :) ) need to go.

I'm glad you found a surgeon and wish the best of luck!
Oh! That *is* strange. And it‚Äôs so frustrating that removing them for gender reasons would be considered elective instead of for health reasons. Like, hello? Mental health IS health. 
So, your mom also happens to be NB?
at least in the US, ‚Äúelective surgery‚Äù means anything that is not immediately life threatening and can be scheduled in advance. for example, having a hernia surgery, mastectomy for cancer, and kidney donation are all elective surgeries. elective doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not for health reasons. 

that being said, it is really shitty how tied up the insurance system and gender/dysphoria alleviating stuff is. i‚Äôm surprised a surgeon would require a letter from a therapist if someone is NOT going through insurance. i believe the year long therapy requirement is BS and classist and it should be more like a month. i‚Äôm glad you found a place where you could schedule your surgery tho!! good luck!
I think there‚Äôs a way to get top surgery covered (in Canada) but I think it‚Äôs the year of therapy and living as your ‚Äònew‚Äô gender BS and I didn‚Äôt want to do that (especially because I‚Äôm nonbinary) 

My mom just paid for it out of pocket. 

I don‚Äôt actually...know what my mom‚Äôs gender is? I haven‚Äôt spoken to her in 10 years for unrelated reasons lol
I guess living a year as my ‚Äúnew‚Äù gender wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, except I‚Äôm agender so... whatever that‚Äôs supposed to ‚Äôlook‚Äô like. Maybe just telling people for a year? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Late 30s feeling like an imposter	"Hey friends. 

I‚Äôm a 38yo AFAB and recently realized I‚Äôm NB. But I also feel this intense sense of imposter syndrome...like this little voice in my head saying ‚Äúdude, you‚Äôve been watching too many Tiktoks‚Äù.

Context: I‚Äôve always known I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúlike the other girls‚Äù. At 11 I told my mom (Polish catholic) that I was attracted to women and she promptly said it was a ‚Äúdisease‚Äù I‚Äôd grow out of and started dressing me in wool and lace Laura Ashley dresses. My mom was an abusive, alcoholic narcissist but the only time I ever stood up to her was when I had finally had enough of the dresses and threw a fit.

For me growing up ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù, I was mostly exposed to either butch or femmes. But I really never found my place in either presentation. Sometimes I like to let down my long hair and prance around in my Victoria secret Brazilians, but other times I relish being called sir at the grocery store.

At uni, I was a big fan of Judith Butler and gained an understanding of gender as a social construct and performance. It was the first time I felt that I was getting closer to something deep inside of me.

Recently I‚Äôve started reading more about the non-binary experience and it just feels like it clicks....like it‚Äôs that missing puzzle piece. When I experiment using they/them or even he/they pronouns I get a distinct feeling of excitement and joy. It just feels like YES.

In the past, I understood the non-binary identity was one ONLY for androgynous people. But recently I have come to understand that it truly is about fluidity. a beautiful analogy I heard on Tiktok was that gender is like murmuring birds....which made me weep. This is exactly the feeling I‚Äôve always had.

But, you know, I‚Äôm 38 and part of me is like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just having a midlife crisis‚Äù, ‚Äúyou just want to stay relevant, you old fart‚Äù. 

I guess I‚Äôm reaching out here for some support to help me quell those voices, that insidious imposter syndrome that makes me so nervous to finally wear my identity with pride.

Thanks üíõü§çüíúüñ§

* Edit: thank you all so so much for your comments and support. Y‚Äôall made me cry a little. It really means a lot."	"so! it's really interesting that imposter syndrome is used to explain this phenomenon so often, and on first blush, we might think it's a mistake, but I think it's actually pretty illuminating!

imposter syndrome is the phenomenon of people, usually or especially people from a marginalized group, not feeling like they've earned whatever award or privilege or recognition they have gotten.

do you see why using it in this instance might be seen as a mistake? but like I said, I think it's actually really telling that so many people use it.

*because we live in a transphobic society, having a non-cis gender is seen as a privilege to be earned* 

but that's not the case at all! literally anyone can be nonbinary just by showing up! *cis is not the default state of humanity, so you don't have to earn or justify your way out of it!*

you are absolutely valid, and more importantly, *there's no such thing as being invalid*
I too was in my mid-30s before I found the language that fit how I knew myself to be - non-binary, trans masculine(mid-40s now). For me it also just clicked, this is me, I‚Äôm not broken and I found myself. This past year was the first time I was comfortable living openly as me and I can‚Äôt imagine going back. Take time to sit with it but if it feels right go with it. Good luck!
People like us didn't have any representation when we were young and figuring it out with everyone else. Of course it took us longer to get there! And that's okay. It sucks that we missed out on that puzzle piece but we've got it now. 

I bet these kids would be delighted to know there are older enbies in existence. We can validate them and they us. We can help set the stage for them. Start incorporating inclusivity into the workplace so that when they have jobs, they have an easier time. I am super glad that people 30 and up are coming out now. 

It's easy to want to separate our existence in a generational sense. But that's not really helping anyone, is it? We can learn from all ages and good for you for being able to be yourself! People our age need to see it. People younger need it too. üôåüèª
I‚Äôm 15 but I can tell you that gender doesn‚Äôt have an age. You are not trying to stay relevant or having a midlife crisis. You are valid! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Oo I feel this post, tho a bit differently.

I'm 28 and PoC (south asia ) and... Well admittedly scrolling thru have seen few PoC representation, which makes me think I don't belong here what so ever. 

But then again I have to think - we are a minority in a minority.

And that generally happens to most PoC peeps in these sorts of spaces. It's often dominated by a specific look (and at times some appropriated looks). 

It's hard to find yourself in a space you don't see yourself reflected in. üòî
You are 100% valid. I‚Äôm early 40s and also have a narcissistic parent. I‚Äôve known & supported trans/genderqueer/nonbinary friends since my own college days, but I had to spend literal decades unlearning the conditioning of my childhood before it occurred to me that I was ‚Äúallowed to be‚Äù non-binary. 

You are valid! Your identity is your own and no one else gets to dictate it! You made it!
34, amab, newly enby trans fem this year, haven't even started my hormones yet. Took me a lot of work to accept where I am and suffered a lot of impostor syndrome because I didn't know from a young age and most stories I found talked about that. But as time has gone on I find more and more people who come to understand these things later in life and realize that it's ok if you didn't know during puberty or even in your 20s. You know when you know and as another commenter pointed out, you can't feel impostor syndrome if you don't already feel a connection to something to even question if you belong. The fact that you question already indicates you belong, someone who's cis wouldn't even be having that conversation with themselves. Best of luck, you are valid and don't forget that these things can be fluid and trust yourself if you find yourself elsewhere under the gender non confirming umbrella in the future, that will be valid too

*Edit: autocorrect changed enby to envy
I'm 26. I just remind myself ""back in our/my day"" we had the term  ""genderqueer"". -- Even if we didn't personally know the term/language; us existing isn't a new concept. You're beyond valid. Plus all these youngins' will be older one day too. (We're not old btw, we're older for sure-- but we're not ancient).
I have the same impostor syndrome for different reasons. I know it's tough to break. Something that helps me a lot is to have my partner or a friend telling me I'm valid. I can also say that you are, because you have all rights to define your own gender identity, if that helps I gladly say so.

I kind of understand how you feel about coming out as NB later in life. I'm 31, and when I was a teenager this word didn't even exist (at least nowhere near me). So, by using this term, or even genderqueer, sometimes I feel that I try to fit in a new fashion that is not mine. However, I believe we just use the words available in our language to describe ourselves, and that none fit perfectly ever. We just express what we feel in the language of 2021, and those words are luckily in our presence. Let's just use them :)
An absolutely fascinating idea to explore and one that I will definitely let percolate. Deconstructing cishetnormativity is a constant practice, isn‚Äôt it?
How beautiful! I‚Äôm trying to fully embrace this experience and there‚Äôs so much joy and excitement (especially exploring new pronouns).
Same thing with the language and culture discovery (51 now). It feels amazing to be able to actually talk and compare notes and have a sounding board without having to twist yourself into convoluted lengthy explanations!

To the OP: ofc you are valid! And way too young for a midlife crisis, too!
This X 100! I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs and didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcome to terms‚Äù until about 5 years ago (and I not really ‚Äústraight‚Äù, but had convinced myself I was, so that was included in the package).
This is a great point! We really didn‚Äôt have the language (especially where I grew up). And when I first learned about NB I truly thought I was ‚Äúsupposed to be more androgynous‚Äù lol.

You know, I love your point about having that example of older queers...this was so so important to me growing up. I was fascinated by Radcliffe Hall and Virginia Woolf as a kid and as I came into my queer identity, having those examples in my community were vital.
Thank you, friend! üíú
I‚Äôm not PoC and I don‚Äôt see myself reflected here either. Doesn‚Äôt mean either of us are not valid. I think most enby‚Äôs would look at my life and might think I‚Äôm suspicious for my actions.  I look and dress and mostly act the part of a cis-male.  And sure my life, job and lifestyle mold that to an extent, but it is where I mostly rest. In my mind is where that fluid transfer from masculine to feminine takes place the most.

I have found that the self validation from within is what keeps me sane.  And the rest well it doesn‚Äôt really matter. 

If you are fluid even by a tenth you belong here. If this is where you can feel safe when things get tough to deal with. That‚Äôs the point of this.  I still relate he/him but there are times when I can be a bit they/them, and also times when is feel very she/her. And I now accept that and what it means, that‚Äôs why I belong here. I don‚Äôt hide from it and my female heart is not stuffed in a closet just crying that I let them be heard.

I came out 4 weeks ago at the age of 45 but have felt this way my whole life. It is not going anywhere and it is not a phase. What I have found since I admitted this to me and to my wife, is I can now breath. I am free and I get to explore this side of me and learn from it and grow and help the youth of this world to understand and feel acceptance. 

Please understand it is not your color that make you unique and beautiful. It is simply you, and I feel that this group will accept you more for what‚Äôs inside you than what‚Äôs outside because that is something all of us have been dealing with our whole lives.
I am white, but I understand this! 

Oppression and marginalization are on a spectrum, and it must be challenging to see marginalized spaces still be dominated by white, euro-centric, and at times even colonialist narratives.

But I think when a community is sensitive to that and makes sure they proactively create a space for different looking/sounding experiences, we are all the better for it.
Thank you! I‚Äôm sorry you had a NPD parent. I know what that can mean when it comes to undoing years of gaslighting and starting to give yourself permission to be yourself (free of people‚Äôs expectations).
I am putting this ‚Äúfuture validation‚Äù card in my back pocket now. Thank you üòä"	kq05dv	NonBinary	27	1.0	2021-01-04 03:28:25

My partner's a NOPE	I thought coming out would be filled with joy. I can kind of see why some people put it off their whole lives because it's so unbelievably painful at the same time. Stepping into myself means stepping away from my partner. They aren't interested in educating themselves or showing up in any capacity. They act like it's not happening. I've been out for a year and they still haven't processed what I'm going through or been a space for me to share or even asked any questions. I feel very alone throughout this process. Now that I'm choosing to seek out HRT and considering chest reduction, it seems like that was when it finally started to make sense for my partner. We discussed splitting up but staying in a platonic partnership, but that doesn't really help anything if they are still not educating themselves or showing up in any way? I feel like they want to seem like an ally but refuse to do any of the actual ground work to be one. Anyway so becoming myself seems to mean ending my marriage which is a lot. We've been to counselling and it's made us question everything about our relationship. I'm starting to come to peace with the fact that I have to choose myself and my own happiness before any other relationship üò≠üíî	"I'm proud that you chose yourself üíô it's not easy but it is the right choice!
Damn, sorry to hear that. I'm going through a very similar situation right now with my wife. Feel free to DM if you need someone to talk to.
I'm sorry that this is happening to you, but I'm glad to see that you're choosing your own happiness. Maybe if your partner sees you happy being true to yourself, maybe they will turn around, be a true ally and start supporting your transition.
Thank you it's so hard but I know I deserve self love above all else
Ultimately you both would have been miserable... but it's little to no comfort. 

I just started my transition journey and it cost me dearly to. But I have no regrets.

I think I finally know.	"For the past week I (AFAB, for context) have been telling myself a mixture of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to be a woman‚Äù and ‚ÄúI am a woman‚Äù and it‚Äôs been difficult. (Over the years I‚Äôve been telling myself a mixture of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to be a woman‚Äù and ‚ÄúI guess I was supposed to be a man or something.‚Äù) About an hour ago I decided to switch gears (per my BFF‚Äôs advice) ; I told myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm non-binary‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a demiwoman; I‚Äôm partially a woman and partially not.‚Äù (She had suggested that I try telling myself one then the other and see which one fit.)

One of the things that‚Äôs confused me in researching gender is all this talk about gender euphoria. Like, 

honey, üëàüòéüëà this depression don‚Äôt stop! 

I‚Äôve felt pretty before (rarely) and liked my body (rarely) but I didn‚Äôt know if it counted as gender euphoria. 

When I told myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm non-binary,‚Äù the closest I can compare it to is when I discovered I have ADHD. Like, the JOY of everything making sense! Not telling myself that I‚Äôm supposed to be something, but telling myself what I am. 

I‚Äôm still going to talk to my therapist about this, because I want to compare my experience to ones she‚Äôs learned about, but I think I‚Äôm non-binary, more towards the female side than male.

Hi! üòÅ"	"Hello!! happy you found a label for yourself :]
Hi friend!
I wanted to let you know that I can totally relate, finding out about NB/Agender gave me just as much clarity as getting an ADHD diagnosis. Good times! ( Íàç·¥óÍàç)
I realised I had dysphoria from trying to conform to female, and feel so much better having dropped that mask.
Thank you! ü§ó I‚Äôm also excited to see if this positively transfers to my body image issues I‚Äôve had most of my life.
Like, if having an accurate understanding of myself will help me in other ways.
Awesome! ( ^ . ^ )b
Yea get that!! it's not exactly the same but atleast in my experience as a trans guy accepting that part of myself also ended up correlating with liking my body more. so good luck w that!"	o9ab61	NonBinary	26	0.93	2021-06-28 01:39:37

A Good Friend	"I was coming out as Noah, they/them to a group chat of mostly accepting people, but there were two people I was very nervous to tell. I sent a long paragraph, and asked people to message me directly if they were confused. I took a deep breath, and turned off my phone. I was shaking like crazy. I got a notification from one of my friends who is accepting. I unlocked my phone to see, ""Does a hot dog count as a sandwich? You said to message you if we were confused, soooooooooo..."". I laughed out loud. It was a moment of joy in an otherwise very scary moment. I'm really grateful for him."	"Technically yes, but colloquially no. It‚Äôs like how you order a burger at the drive through, and the employee asks if you want the combo/meal, and you say ‚Äúno, just the sandwich‚Äù and you get just the burger.

Conflicting feelings on coming out day	"Just....needed to get this out without possibly accidentally guilting the people I‚Äôm talking about

Seeing people coming out, esp people who grew up in the same horrible small town as I did, is such a beautiful thing that I can‚Äôt even begin to describe it. My heart overflows with joy for these people 

Then I know that I will probably stay closeted the rest of my life except to those closest to me. Between my career field (accounting) and parents who are more traditional in certain ways, it‚Äôs just not worth coming out. Especially not with today‚Äôs political climate. And that‚Äôs not even getting into mental health issues that would actually be exacerbated by coming out (ie paranoia)

I‚Äôm absolutely thrilled for those who are out, I just also know I‚Äôll probably never be one of them

Guess I may as well at least come out somewhere today. Hi, my name is Kai (possibly, still a recent choice) and I prefer they/them pronouns. I‚Äôm bi and nonbinary and just because I‚Äôm closeted doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not proud "	"Hello, Kai! I can relate to this very strongly. I'm sorry your situation is how it is. You are valuable, worthy, and valid, even if you are unable to come out publicly. <3

I have my hrt consultation this Friday but I'm feeling awful because my boyfriend is being distant	"I just really need to vent about my life for a sec.

My boyfriend is really uncomfortable with me transitioning though he respects that I'm going to do it no matter what.  

I put this off for so long so that he could grow more comfortable with the idea of me starting testosterone and looking for top surgery resources. So now that the appointment is around the corner I want to jump for joy and celebrate with the person I'm closest to, but hes so *down*.  And if I give him space to open up, either hinting or directly, he says its other stuff.  But I know how upbeat and fun he can be and he hasn't been that at all for the last week or so.

I can only guess at how hard it must be for him as a straight cis man to watch his partner of 5 years want to change so much.  I get how scary the what-ifs are.

But I wish he was rooting for me."	"I had a similar experience with my wife, about 4 months ago when I was getting my appointment set. It was difficult, because I was feeling very anxious about everything and I didn't have my best friend and number one supporter cheering me on. In the end, she went with me and was (and continues to be) supportive though. It took her a while to be overtly positive about medical transition. I was clear with her about my feelings surrounding that, but she also told me that it put a lot of pressure on her to be a cheerleader and validate me emotionally, when we both already discussed that it was something I needed to do and would do. So, I empathize with your feelings, because I had similar ones. I would communicate with him and let him know how you feel, but also keep in mind that he does have his own feelings that he's processing and a lack of enthusiasm isn't always a rejection. It can be a lot of pressure to make a partner feel like their emotional reaction either validates or invalidates us, but if we communicate our needs honestly we can at least work on supporting each other (or helping each other find support in appropriate places, like support groups and/or therapy). Hopefully he comes around and starts being more actively supportive, because you definitely deserve that in a romantic partner. 
""But I wish he was rooting for me. ""  


I so feel this today. <3  I'm in the process of coming out at work (told my boss so far but telling coworkers later this week) and he just doesn't understand why it's so important to me.  He told me he thinks it would feel weird.  He's a super private person too, and I'm like a flag waver, so there's kind of a disconnect there.  I just wish he would support me more instead of feeling like he's trying to talk me out of it.  


I just made a post about this too
This reminds me of the part in The Argonauts when the partner person has scheduled top surgery and Maggie is full of concerns. Her partner just says, ""Yeah, but imagine how I feel!"" There's a couple of lines about support like, ""I got it. I did it.""

I think it's fair for a cis partner to have feelings, but that the other partner's job is NOT processing those feelings. Protect the most vulnerable, not the person with the most freak outs.

This sub has been huge for me, mind if I unload for a sec?	"I just absolutely had to say that I owe the people on this sub a fountain of gratitude. The self assuredness, the pride, the joy, and the support each of you provides for one another has been instrumental in making me not only more comfortable in my skin, but giving me the courage to express myself in ways I thought impossible. It's because of you all that I have finally bought my first few femme outfits and I'm elated having clothes that let me experience that bit of gender euphoria I've missed out on for so long. For as long as I can remember I have hated having pictures of me taken, I didn't like how I looked, I thought I looked awkward, and just avoided it as much as I could. But in the past few months I've taken more selfies than I have in the last 30 years combined, and each one has this incredible power of validation, reassuring me that I am truly who I'm supposed to be.

"""feminine man"" to non-binary!"	"A nice little story üòá:

As a kid, from when I was in middle school, I could see that my preferences weren't the same as those of any other boy's. But that didn't mean that I wished that I were a girl either. I used to be a 'model student' and a loner. 

I barely had a friend or two, so I didn't feel pressured to be like ""the others"" and embraced my emotions and accepted that I was a ""feminine man"" üôÇ. I was teased, but I didn't give a crap. (I did feel sad üòî , though).

Is my professor insensitive, or am i hypersensitive?	"TRIGGER WARNING!

This happened awhile ago, but I haven't been able to shake how frustrated and embarrassed I still feel.

This is a professor to whom I had already disclosed that I were non binary. I hadn't necessarily wanted to; her assignments demanded students to choose between a 'boy' or 'girl' pov when analyzing advertising campaigns. I physically couldnt get myself to do the assignment just cause of how conflicted i felt about having to choose a gender. And it pissed me off because i knew what she was getting at; she'd come to the next class and point out differnces between what adverts mean for men and women, and about how they are so different. And then I'd be Isolated, and thats never fun?

Anyway. Thats not what this post is about.

This post is about how, after telling her politely that i am unable to do the assignment cause i dont conform to binary measures of gender, and that im fine with her not grading my assignment, she did something far worse.

Halfway into the semester, and im sitting at the front of our auditorium (I'm a little deaf and my eyesight isnt the best). Our professor takes a break from her lecture and is just chatting up the class. I have my headphones in cause no one likes to sit next to me and music is nice.

Professor has an idea. She wants all the boys to leave the auditorium for 5 minutes so she can have some girl talk.

And perhaps she'd forgotten this was the class with the trans kid, cause then she joked aloud,
'unless you have an identity crisis, leave the room'.
I can still hear the glib tone, and how betrayed and exposed i felt.

The boys were glad to leave. Some paused next to my seat and asked why I wasn't moving out, had i not heard what the professor said? 

Im glued to my seat cause i dont know what to do? I dont identify as male so why should i leave? Not that i was particularly interested in whatever the fuck that professor had say. I hated how singled out i felt.

But i was scared to stay, too. I wasnt out publicly yet. I was sitting front and center as the class moved around me. If i stayed, wouldn't people realize i was different?
I am in no way ashamed of being who i am. But i refuse to be 'made' to come out to people? Isn't that a personal detail you share with people that matter? Who you trust not to hurt you?

Where i live, trans people are lynched, or raped, or murdered. I thought people in as prestigious a university as mine would host more inclisive mindsets. Yet people avoid me if they can.

Anyway. It got worse. When the professor saw me still sitting, she moved over to me and repeated her instructions. As if i was too dumb to understand.
I stared at her, very knowingly, silently asking if she was sure what she was doing right now.
I think thats when she realized that I didn't think this game was very funny. I kicked the door open with my leg on my way out cause i was so frustrated, and im sure someone saw that.

And the cherry on top; a minute later, she asks one of the boys to come tell me that i can stay after all!

So now everyone nows im different! Oh, Joy!

I thought professors were privileged with enough years of knowledge and maturity to understand manners. 


Am i overreacting? But if i am, why is my reaction so visceral?"	"that is? so unprofessional on almost all fronts. this is a university, yes? if my professor asked certain people to leave the room for some chats id be fucking amazed and would drop that class. you are not hypersensitive. that is insane.
What the professor did is so strange to me?? You definitely had a valid reaction. If that happened in a class I was in I would probably bring it to the head of the department.
This isn't acceptable. 
Check to see if the school has an inclusivity policy or better yet, a SOGIE policy. That type of bigotry shouldn't be allowed to go unchallenged.
So fucking enraged by this, you're not fucking insensitive 

I would like you to consider putting a ""possible trigger"" warning on this post please, if that's an option
That‚Äôs fucking insane what the prof did. You were unjustly treated and of course you would be hurt by the experience. Hang in there.
You might want to see if the university has an ombudsperson appointed for handling student complaints, and file a complaint with them. The behaviour from this professor seems to me plainly unacceptable, and based on my experience in academia, is likely in violation of the university's diversity and inclusion policy. The ombudsperson would be able to make sure there is no risk of reprisal in grading or anything like that.
Fuck that prof. You have all rights to be mad.
Even if I were cis, I wouldve still felt that it was utterly unnecessary and honestly just perpetuating stereotypes, separating people by boys/girls is just... bleh, both in the assignment and in the chatting thing, and I still can't believe that this is in a university. 

\-- AND I AINT EVEN CIS! The professor certainly needs to get her eyes opened and know more about how these sorts of thing can hurt not even trans people but also cis people. I dont think she wouldve done it intentionally if she knows what harm it meant, but god, it is still negligent to not try to understand a bit more what she can do to help if she knows for sure there's a trans student in her class! Your hurt is very valid, no one wants to be forced into a situation where they are forced to be 'outed', and it is very distressing
You‚Äôre not overreacting.

A.) Everyone she made leave that room was denied an equal amount of educational time. That‚Äôs discrimination on the basis of perceived sex.

B.) Gender identity is almost certainly considered a protected characteristic, and she made transphobic jokes and made you leave the room though you are not male. She probably outed you (also completely inappropriate) because she realized you might choose to file a complaint, and that there‚Äôs a good chance it would be taken seriously if you chose to do so.
I feel overwhelmed by your vindication; I've been embarrassed and cry-ey about what happened for so long and only now is the entitlement for that reaction dawning on me. Thankyou for validating my hurt
Thankyouu üíï maybe i should put more thought into reporting her. I'm just scared of exposing myself even more than i already have. Most of me just wants to stay out of this instructor's way so that i dont get hurt again
There wasn't a flair for it so i added one in all caps at the opening! I'm so sorry you had to stumble into this and be blindsided by the outrage. But i appreciate you validating my feelings so much !!
your hurt is so incredibly valid. i dont attend university anymore so i dont know how proceedings go, but perhaps its possible to report that professor if you feel confident enough. i hope you have better experiences soon. :-)
Honestly that is also a valid option. Don‚Äôt do anything that would put you in danger! Do you have any friends who could maybe report her on you behalf? Or maybe wait to take action until you don‚Äôt have to deal with this professor again
Oh lmao I didn't see this one

It's not thr outrage that bothers me lol it's just a situaion that is really triggering for me

My Mom finally gendered correctly.	"I 1st came out as nonbinary over a year ago. When I came out I expected no support or acceptance from my Dad who has typically been very homophobic and against things he considers to be 'the norm' but I was stunned and upset when my Mom; whom I came out too as pansexual when I was 14 or so... didn't have the reaction I expected.

&#x200B;

It's been bothering me more then I wanted to admit to myself or anyone. Especially when my Mom admitted that she 'would get if I was binary trans and not nonbinary' and told him that she 'just couldn't get it, I would always be here \[insert gendered child term here\]'. It was awful. 

&#x200B;

BUT I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS FOLKS AND I JUST HAD TO TELL SOMEONE/TALK ABOUT IT!!

&#x200B;

August 6th was my 31st Birthday and I cried when I saw my 'birthday story' of birthday wishes. Where my Dad made a very gendered birthday wish my MOM DIDN'T. She specifically said 'Happy Birthday to my wonderful Child. I am so proud of them and l hope you have an amazing day!'

&#x200B;

I'm still getting emotional over it because it means so much to me. I told her thank you at my small social distancing get together a few days ago and I SO SO hope that she understands how much it meant to me. She is trying and starting to understand how important it is. It's been almost a year since I publicly came out. I had lost hope of every been accepted properly or gendered correctly by my parents. I am so happy.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading. I just had to talk about it/tell someone. I hope you all get to feel the joy of being accepted by people who are important to you as I have!"	"That‚Äôs so good! It‚Äôs awful when they immediately don‚Äôt get it but I‚Äôm so glad she‚Äôs come around
Fortunately I wasnt really surprised neither of my parents got it. I was just surprised by how unsupportive/resistant my Mom was.


She is usually pretty accepting and has always been one of my go to people when I was struggling with things so it felt really disconnecting when she initially reacted how she did. I'm so happy now tho."	i7edjn	NonBinary	24	0.97	2020-08-10 21:43:55
Gender/Ballet Euphoria	"I got a short masc hair cut today for the first time. Because I was a ballerina for like 3/4 of my life I always needed it to go up in a bun. I love ballet but I have always felt very out of place. Just like in other parts of my life I didn‚Äôt fit in with the girls and I found myself distractedly fascinated with any boys in my class. 

At first I figured I had crushes... even when I wasn‚Äôt attracted to them. I now know that really, I wanted to dance the roles they got to perform and the steps they got to uniquely master. I did find joy in tutus and pointe shoes but my heart was always in the jumps, the turns, the raw passion and power of the male sections of choreographies. 

I also hated seeing myself dance. We wore next to nothing in front of wall-ceiling-floor mirrors. I was acutely aware of my body about 2-4 hours per day. I was in so much distress every day because the emotions and inner energy I was feeling was never what I saw reflected back at me. This carried into whenever I saw myself dance whether on tape or in my reflection. The person I felt in my soul and my heart, the one dancing with me every count, was not who I saw staring back at me. I became so disconnected from my body that in order to continue focusing on improving my skills/technique I trained myself never look in the mirror. 

So when I got home with my short hair and bound chest I started dancing. I have never felt so connected and at peace with my body while dancing since I was maybe 7 years old. Then I dared to do some dancing in front of a mirror. And I saw them! For the first time in my life I saw the person who has been trying to dance with me all this time! And I felt euphoria, absolute euphoria. I didn‚Äôt think ballet could feel that way for me."	"I've felt that way too, except that I used to be a syncronized ice skater. I'm likely quitting skating because of it, but I wish I could feel euphoria skating. 

Congrats!!!
It‚Äôs nice to know I‚Äôm not alone in feeling this way. I‚Äôm a dance teacher now so I don‚Äôt have to conform to any gender roles in the studio anymore. I hope one day you‚Äôll be able to feel euphoric when you skate üíúüß°"	ih94rs	NonBinary	23	0.92	2020-08-26 22:36:50
I finally recognized myself in the mirror	"The student org I‚Äôm in throws a formal party/dance every year, and I was really dreading having to go to it. I‚Äôve been having a really tough time with body dysphoria as I‚Äôm figuring out my gender identity, and I only owned very masculine formal wear, which I knew would make me feel even worse. So I decided fuck it, I‚Äôll get an outfit that I actually want to wear and I can look somewhat presentable in. I ordered a longer skirt, women‚Äôs dress shirt, and some jewelry, and put an outfit together. I was running late when I was getting ready, so I didn‚Äôt take time to really look at how I looked before I walked to the event. While I was there everyone was complimenting my outfit, saying how much they liked it, which made me feel really good about myself. (One of my roommates said my outfit‚Äôs vibe was like Luisa from Encanto, definitely my favorite comment of the night)

I ended up having to walk home by myself pretty late at night, which was pretty scary while presenting the way I was, but once I got home I decided to take some mirror selfies to show off my outfit. As I was posing in the mirror, I for the first time didn‚Äôt hate who I saw staring back at me. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. The pretty person in the mirror was ME. That‚Äôs me! I broke down and cried tears of joy for at least half an hour, just living in how I was feeling.

In a recent journal entry I was doing for my therapy session, I said how I couldn‚Äôt recognize the person I saw in the mirror. I knew it was me, but it never felt right until tonight. I finally recognize the person looking back at me, and I was truly the happiest I‚Äôve been for as long as I can remember. It just really gives me hope that things can get better, and I really wanted to share my experience with other people because all my roommates are asleep right now."	"Congratulations!üéâ You have finally found your way to express  yourself.  So happy for you! There's lots of telltale signs in your story that you're going in the right direction. Keep it up, trust your guts and keep on being the real you! üòÅ‚ù§
Congrats !!!
Being able to recognise yourself in the mirror can be very difficult to achive but it is so important and makes you feel so good
We are proud of you for managing to do it !!
Such a beautiful story. Congratulations on finding yourself and for having wonderful friends."	sqlr1w	NonBinary	21	0.97	2022-02-12 07:17:40
Feeling more affirmed than ever tonight and I just had to share	"Since coming out to my partner as non-binary, she has been nothing but supportive. I knew she would - she‚Äôd been supportive of all of my otherwise unexplained experimentation with more feminine clothing before - but it still feels like an absolute blessing to have her using my pronouns and helping me navigate a world I‚Äôm new to and celebrating me in ways big and small.

Today felt like a big one and I‚Äôm still buzzing with euphoria from it. She did my makeup for the first time, just a little so I can get used to the feeling. But ever since we‚Äôve been together, she‚Äôs said she wanted to do my lashes and eye shadow. Now she has and she was absolutely right all along - both do so much to highlight my natural eye color.

After that, we went out to run a few errands. On the way back, she indulged something I‚Äôd wanted to do for a while, which was bra shop with her (I‚Äôd previously done that by myself, guessing on sizing based on what I‚Äôd read here.) Just having her there made me feel that much more confident in the space (Aerie, for reference) especially in the face of side-eyes and double glances when someone (me, amab) rocking two days of peach fuzz pokes their head out of a dressing room. All in all, I walked away with two bralettes that felt so perfect over my shoulders and chest as soon as I got them on (one a plain white, one a light grey with little blue/purple flowers). We capped off the day with her painting my nails a berry purple, which are drying to a perfect shine right this minute.

All this to say - I don‚Äôt know what I would do without her. I‚Äôd be too scared to really show my true self a lot of the time - especially in spaces where I know my build and appearance might not always be welcome - but she makes me feel stronger for letting that part of me out. I‚Äôm feeling more confident in my identity and I just had to share today, another joyful step forward."	"That‚Äôs so wonderful. Sounds like you have an amazing partner.
That sounds like such an awesome day!!

I‚Äôm really happy for you both ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Thanks! It really was such a wonderful day, just what I needed."	r96f80	NonBinary	24	1.0	2021-12-05 03:28:37
What is nonbinary I don't understand	"I'd like to say now that I by no means want to put anyone down or disregard someone's lifestyle and or choices. I'm just being brutally honest with my confusion, please don't take this to heart.

So I've grown up in a family that was never transphobic or homophobic. My family are accepting of trans men, women and gay and bi people ect. (I came out as lesbian a while back). But I've been confused because recently I was told that i was transphobic because I thought nonbinary was not a gender? I don't like being mean to anyone and was upset that I'd hurt someone so I looked it up and it basically said it was like a 3rd gender that was like an ""other"" category? And it made me think because I sort of resonate with what it said. My family (parents especially) have had friends come out as nonbinary and they bitch about them openly saying things like ""this person thinks they're nonbinary now lol"" or "" I wouldn't be surprised if this person is bipolar she keeps saying she's nonbinary and changing her name"". I don't agree with how rude they were but I did think it wasn't real. But now I'm not sure. I don't want  to say I'm nonbinary in case it's some rhetoric getting to my head so I just wanted to ask people who believe they are non binary some questions.

How do you feel gender? Like how do you know what's gender and what's just liking how some clothes look on you?

Do you get gender dysphoria? About what stuff? Do all of you get it about similar things? Is it just to do with ""sexual"" parts of the body?

And do you get gender euphoria? I don't know much of what it is and after reading about it that's what made me second guess. Because when dressing a certain way or seeing other people dress a certain way (specifically alternative style in my case) I get this rush of unexplainable joy and happiness and it pretty much feels like I've become the main protagonist at the start of some movie and the sun is shining and everyone's singing and dancing and happy.

Do you all hate looking feminine/masculine depending on birth gender? Like I'm still happy to dress feminine, just not ""traditional feminine""

Once again I really don't want to upset anyone. This is just how I was raised and I'm genuinely hoping from some insight from another perspective. Please don't take my words to be dictating how I think you should be/act/identify. I appreciate any help ‚ù§Ô∏è"	"So you're probably going to get some pretty varied answers, because nonbinary is kind of an umbrella term. It can include essentially any gender that isn't either '100% male all of the time' or '100% female all of the time'. Some nonbinary people have no gender (agender, genderless, etc), some nonbinary people have a neutral or androgynous gender (neutrois, androgyne, etc), some have multiple or changing genders (bigender, genderfluid, etc), some have genders that are neither male or female or off the scale entirely (maverique, xenogenders, etc). Some people... Just identify as nonbinary and don't feel the need to specify any further. It's both a gender label and a diverse community and umbrella term. Some nonbinary people transition, some don't, and each person's transition path is different. Some have gender dysphoria, others have gender euphoria. Different nonbinary folks may present masc, fem, androgynous, gnc, or change presentations. Nonbinary is under the trans umbrella, and most nonbinary folks identify as trans, but some choose not to for personal reasons.
Society likes to classify people as either men or women. Two binary options, and you're either one or the other. Non-binary is everything that doesn't fit into those two boxes. It's not a third gender (though third gender is an experience some people have, and since it isn't one of the two binary genders, it falls under the non-binary umbrella). Some people experience a specific gender that isn't man or woman (third gender), some experience more than one gender at once (bigender, multigender, pangender), some experience no gender at all (agender), some might experience varying amounts of masculinity or femininity (demiboy, parafeminine), some might have an experience of gender that changes over time (genderfluid), and more.

Sometimes people say that men are from mars and women are from venus. Non-binary isn't another planet, it's *all other planets*, and the rings around them, and moons and asteroids and comets and stars and nebulae and black holes and the empty space in between and more.

Transgender describes an internal experience of gender that doesn't match solely and completely with the gender one is assigned at birth. Thus, since non-binary people aren't either of the two genders people are typically assigned at birth, non-binary falls under the transgender umbrella. So, saying that one doesn't believe non-binary people are real is definitionally transphobic, because non-binary people are transgender.

Note that I've been talking about *internal* experiences of gender here. Gender *roles* are a societal construct, a set of stereotypes and expectations that society has and applies to people based on perceived gender. This is stuff like ""men can't wear dresses"" or ""women are more nurturing."" It includes things like names and pronouns, clothing, and body shape and parts to name a few. But gender *identity* is an internal experience, something in your soul, regardless of how you choose to express yourself. A cis man who puts on a dress is still a cis man, because that outward expression choice doesn't define his gender. Gender expression and presentation is something you *do*, but an internal gender identity is something you *are*.
Hello! Thanks for stopping by and trying to learn more. I will give you my personal opinions and experience on what it means to be non-binary.

I have identified as non-binary since October 2020. I use they/them pronouns and have found a name that I feel suits me better than my current name which is far too gendered for my comfort any more. 

To me, the term ""non-binary"" refers to someone who doesn't identify as either binary gender (i.e., male and female). I also identify as transgender because I don't identify with the gender I was assigned at birth. 

Being enby to me means not feeling as a man or a woman. I don't feel like my birth gender and I don't identify with the other binary gender. I don't feel like any other gender either. It's hard to explain, but I feel like neither and both and none. My desire is to be a mystery, which is, I suppose, to be androgynous. I am a human-shaped potato. I am a gelatinous cube squished into a bipedal mold. I am an amalgam of cats in human form. 

I do have dysphoria around my body because I have features of my AGAB that make it ""obvious"" that I'm that gender, but I'm not. I see myself in the mirror and I don't see who I am. It makes me sad and I hate looking at myself because of it. I am seeking medical assistance to correct this and be closer to how I feel inside. Not all non-binary people want or seek medical intervention, and they are all valid at any level of seeking medical help ‚ù§

To me, my gender identity has nothing to do with my sexuality and I personally don't have an issue with my genitalia. The only people looking in my pants are people I trust and love. I can wear clothes that don't make that obvious so I'm perfectly fine with it. In addition, I fully embrace my biological sex, but that is not the same thing as my gender. It's important for me to have doctors know my biological sex because it impacts any treatment I need for illness or health issues I have. That said, I do have dysphoria over being called by gendered honorifics and the wrong pronouns. 

Overall, the spectrum of non-binary people is extraordinarily vast and I think even goes into other dimensions from what standard society thinks of gender as. Whereas male and female is either end of a line, non-binarism is all that's between, beyond, around, and without that line. It can seem daunting, but as long as you know what you are comfortable as, that's all that matters. You don't need labels, but they can help you find your comfort zone and even explain how you feel to others. In the end, the most important thing is that you're happy!
it has long been the case that there is a gender binary, which isn‚Äôt true its bi-modal, and nb colloquially refers to being outside of the gender binary. 

I could be wrong about this

I didn‚Äôt read the block.
Google is your friend. Stop expecting us to do the work for you.
So nonbinary is NOT a third gender, but it's not necessarily no gender either (that's agender which is a subset of nonbinary but not all nonbinary folks are agender).  Basically the way I conceptualize it is that gender isn't boy/girl/nonbinary and all in neat little boxes, it's a spectrum and nonbinary folks can fall anywhere between boy and girl, can fluctuate, or can exist off the gender spectrum entirely.

I'm somewhere between agender & genderfluid - some days I feel more masculine, some feminine, some days I don't want to be perceived as any gender at all.  I personally think gender as a concept is entirely just made up bs, but it's so ingrained in society now that no matter what we do people will perceive us as a certain gender, and for me it's how I want to be perceived that varies.

I don't really get much dysphoria, but I know others who do.  For me it's more the other end of that spectrum, I experience euphoria when I look a way that aligns with my own perception of my gender.  

Nonbinary folks don't owe anyone androgyny.  Some do prefer to not be masc or femme at all, but there are others (like me) who just don't feel aligned with any particular gender or set of gender roles & wear whatever makes them feel good.  

Hope that all makes sense, gender identity can be a complicated subject to lay out in one comment.
Gender is inside, not how you dress or what you enjoy doing or any of that. If someone thought they might be a woman, for example, but didn't want to wear dresses, would you tell them they must not be a woman after all? Of course not.

There are infinite ways to be a non-binary person. You could be completely content with how your body grew. You could want to ""fully"" transition. You could have some in-between plan where some stuff is okay and others definitely need to change. Or anything. Your body is also not your gender.

So then the question is, of course, what *is* gender, and for that I have little to offer. I personally have never found a gender that I feel like I belong to, and describe myself as being agender because I think the answer to that for me is that gender is a thing some other people have that I should believe in and respect even though I don't experience it. I am under the impression though that others feel a sense of internal resonance to a certain identity, and it just feels correct to them in much the same way that ""man"" and ""woman"" and all of the others feel incorrect to me. If you feel that way about some term, hold it gently. Don't try to logic it to death by insisting on proof, just believe yourself.
Would like to just stop by and say that unfortunately discrimination against certain groups in the queer (LGBTQ+) community from selectively supportive allies or LGBTQ+ people is quite common. Lesbians or gays might think bisexuals are not ‚Äúreally queer‚Äù or too promiscuous (biphobia). TERFs claim trans women are predators. Gay men won‚Äôt date trans guys. Hell, some trans people are ‚Äútransmeds‚Äù and say you‚Äôre not *really* trans unless you medically transition with hormones and therapy. It‚Äôs all a huge mess of gatekeeping and hypocrisy. So just because your parents are not the most transphobic or homophobic people out there doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt...selectively transphobic, against nonbinary people for example.
Others are doing a good job of explaining but TLDR: Gender is a social construct. Aka we, as a society, can literally decide what gender means. It‚Äôs fake, artificial, and while it‚Äôs usually tied to biological sex, it really doesn‚Äôt have to be. Being nonbinary embraces that concept fully.

I do experience gender dysphoria. Before I transitioned, I looked fairly feminine and would have the strange feeling of not recognizing the person in the mirror. I personally hate when people look at me and go ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs a woman‚Äù, because that usually comes with a buttload of assumptions and judgements that come with being a woman. When are you getting married, will you have kids, let‚Äôs go shopping etc etc. I dislike being put into a box. I want people to look at me and go ‚Äúwhat the fuck is that‚Äù, and then have to get to know me as a *person*. I think there‚Äôs definitely power in identifying as a woman and defying those assumptions. But there‚Äôs also power in saying, fuck your stereotypes, I‚Äôm ME and I‚Äôm making it purposefully difficult for you to make instant assumptions. Will people still make assumptions about me? Of course. But my ambiguous and definitely non-conventional gender presentation will give them pause, at least, and I just need that small opening.
No shame in asking about something you never learned.

Nonbinary is an umbrella term for anything outside the male-female binary. Some people identify with both, some identify with neither. I happen to identify with a varied mix of both, and occasionally neither. My gender is not and never has been fixed. 

Because it is an umbrella term, it embraces a whole spectrum of gender identities and cannot be narrowly defined. Some subsets of nonbinary include agender, genderfluid, bigender, transgender (not all trans are enby, not all enbies are trans). 

My best advice for discovering what enby means is to listen to others, and to try to define what gender means to you. You may find more freedom in knowing yourself and how you relate to gender.
What i dont understand is i always hear gender is a social construct, if this is true then how is gender dysphoria a thing? Why cant a person just work with what they have? Im not being a jerk here, just curious
I'm sorry I tried googling but it didn't explain very well and I wanted to hear from people who actually identify as non binary im really sorry
Hey so being a jerk to people asking questions is not helpful either

Finally Out	"I just came out to my parents today. I was really reluctant, but they were actually really supportive. I told them my pronouns, what not to call me, and answered their questions (which were actually really nice and respectful) they now know I prefer Mx. Instead of Ms. among other things.
I still have a lot im learning about myself, but I just feel so happy. It feels amazing and I feel like crying happy tears. Sorry if this doesnt belong here, I just couldnt contain my joy and relief."	"Happy for you ü§ç

The joy of looking mega masc after a shower (he/they)		"you look great!!
you should feel super confident!"	u4pwv8	NonBinary	23	1.0	2022-04-16 04:27:07
Just gushing...	For a long time, I was constantly doubting myself. It was driving me mad in an indescribable way. I knew there was something different about me. I wasn't like the other girls, with their social media and hair braiding. I liked gaming, and found what boys were doing to be much more interesting. I came to this realization and was desperate to find an answer. I was searching everywhere, but nothing seemed right. I felt like when I found something that was similar, I forced myself to abide by the definition. It was like I was longing for an answer so badly, I would change myself to find it. I wanted a definition. Some say that they don't like labels, but it was the exact opposite. I wanted a label. Very badly. I kept on searching, everyday the doubt growing stronger. Finally, the magical term came on the screen.  I had never seen it before. I looked into it. This time, it was exactly what I was looking for. I doubted this label too, thinking it was just another one of me forcing myself. But, after a few days, I noticed it. Exactly what it described playing out in my own life. I was overcome with more than joy, it was pure bliss. Than it came to me. It may seem plain as day to some, but it was an amazing thing I realized. A label should fit me, not the other way around. I can't tell you how liberating that was. Instead of forcing myself to find the similarities, I was finding them pop up on their own. It was magical. It was an ethereal bliss. You have no reason to read this, but yet you are. Thank you, I had to get this of my shoulders.	"It's very nice to read stories like yours. I'm happy that you found a label that feels right. 

If you don't mind, what is this label that you like so much?
I really resonate with your story! I only found the NB label about a week ago. Before then I'd just decided I was a girl who didn't fit gender stereotypes, but it didn't 100% fit. I grew up playing video games and felt most at home in a group of guy friends. This label feels a bit more like home. As a result of my newfound confidence I'm finally chopping my hair short soon! Glad you're feeling happy friend <3
I relate to this as well (kind of). I thought I was a girly-ish girl, but when I started going by a gender neutral name and cut my hair, a lot of the depression I had before went away. When I tried on a button-down shirt it felt even better. That‚Äôs when I realized I didn‚Äôt feel as much like a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù anymore. It‚Äôs great that you figured out whatever label you are using!
Feels so good to find words that fit üòª
I resonate with your story too but from the other direction.   I think I was this originally before the term became common.   Then many years later like 20 or so.  I am reading about me in these labels.   I resonate with gender fluid and non-binary.

I grew up in an environment where reasons for why I was doing or the way I was were demanded of me.  Back then I didn‚Äôt have the label so I used the next closest thing and it was horrible and coming out as that had the opposite effect. 

So I welcome my non-binary gender fluid label because it is something I can point to and say I am this and this is why I am the way I am and need to do these things.
Wow! thank you all so much! This means a lot to me! <3
versa androgyny!! :3

To the demiboys here, what is your experience? How would you describe what being a demiboy is like for you?	"Hi, I've recently cracked and realised I'm nonbinary, and I'm now trying to figure out my more specific gender flavour. I think I might be either agender or a demiboy, so I'm trying to see what experience I relate to more.  I'm AFAB and always struggled with being a proper girl, never felt like that fit me, I went through some phases as a kid when I straight out said I was a boy and believed it because I didn't know of anything outside of the binary.

Now I know I'm nonbinary (even if a small part of me is still in denial), and I prefer neutral pronouns and titles like they/them and Mx, but at the same time I get euphoria from some masc terms (like when someone calls me a boy I just get this surge of joy?) and I'd definitely prefer to be clocked as a guy than a girl, but like, a pretty guy instead of a hypermasculine one. I feel like I'm just me, and gender doesn't necessarily define me, at least binary genders don't, but I'm more in touch with my masc side. I'm confused because I know I'm not a man, but I've always identified with the masculine side of things more, and since I was a kid I always said I wish I was AMAB instead, and a part of me wonders if I even would have had this gender crisis if I had or would instead have just been a more feminine boy.

Anyway, sorry this is so long and confused but if you could tell me what you think about this I'd be grateful, thanks! üòÑ"	"I generally call myself a nonbinary man / nonbinary trans man, rather than demiboy, but I do think I fit that label. 

I don't really feel like a 100%, binary man, but I do still feel like a dude. I consider myself a gay man, a trans man, even a man in general, just not quite *fully.* I will say, the farther into my transition I get, the more my nonbinary identity has begun to feel... a little more about how I understand gender as a whole and a little less about how I understand myself, I guess.

I def feel you about liking being a 'pretty guy' rather than hypermasc. I spent so long thinking I couldn't be trans because I wasn't especially masculine, but now I *love* being an effeminate man. I'm on T and post top surgery, and I LOVE exploring my femininity with my new masculine body. I like being read as a man by strangers, especially now that I can be read as a gnc / gay man. I don't mind they/them pronouns at all around other trans people, and in the kind of space where basically everyone uses they/them pronouns, I prefer that. But I also like he/him pronouns, especially outside of nonbinary spaces.

My advice in general is to not focus too much on labels, especially early in transition. Labels can provide a sense of security and connect us to a community, and that's great, but it's not something you should stress over. And you definitely shouldn't worry about trying to find a single \~correct\~ label. The word(s) you find best suit you will likely change as you explore your relationship with gender and as you transition. Rather than try to figure out a label, I think it's important to figure out what you want -- what pronouns and language feel right to you, how you want to present, what aspects (if any) you want of medical transtion, etc. There aren't any parts of transition that are off limits to nonbinary folks, nor any parts that are required for binary trans people.
Demiboy is a term that I identify with (though there are others as well that I identify with to some degree, but agender isn't one of them). Depending on the day, I generally get euphoria from either masc or neutral terms (and sometimes fem terms, but much less often). I feel like I lack an understanding of gender in the way that people fully identifying as men understand it, and therefore I don't give gender as much importance as other people do (I'm a writer, and gender is one of the last things I think about in creating characters). Or perhaps it's the other way around, meaning because I care about gender less, I don't put effort into understanding it, and therefore have less of an understanding. If I was AMAB... I feel like I possibly would've felt more comfortable, though there are still some aspects typically associated with it that I don't think I would like.
 I don't explicitly identify with the demiboy label for a couple reasons, but I think it's fairly close to my identity. To me, I see it as if I *had* to choose between man or woman, I'd pick man- but that's not 100% me. I feel sort of disconnected to gender in general; being read as male is preferable, and I'd ideally like to be read as either a soft man or a visibly nonbinary person. 

In general, I've leaned more into femininity the deeper into transition I've gotten and I hear that's fairly normal. For now, my advice pretty much comes down to this: you don't necessarily have to have a label (but do use one if it makes you more comfortable!). You can just look at things like a checklist- how do you feel about using he/him? They/them? Being called a brother or son? Growing a beard? Dressing in male cuts? Wearing pastels?

Thinking like that helped me a lot in my early days of exploration. And good luck!
While I‚Äôm not technically a demiboy, this may be hopeful to you. 

I still consider myself trans masculine, but I‚Äôm actually agender. It took me same time to figure it out, mainly because I was confusing how I want to look post transition (my desired presentation) and my identity (my actual gender identity). My final conclusion is that I‚Äôm agender (this gender empty, YEET) but my presentation leans heavily towards the masculine side. Basically, while I don‚Äôt feel like a guy (in any way, shape, or form) I do want to look like a guy (or at least be mistaken for one at first). Hope this can be helpful to you, remember; gender identity and gender presentation don‚Äôt always line up!
Hi sorry i'm late, um... For me i feel like being a Demiboy gives me more freedom physically, emotionally, and mentally to dress and act how I want. I'm AMAB but recently in the past year ive seen sudden changes. Ive gone from male to Demiboy to Boyflux then back to Demiboy then nonbinary and then again Demiboy. When I was nonbinary I realized I knew I didn't want to be male but not entirely Enby so I thought Demiboy was the better option

To be honest, the way i figured it out is that you have to listen to yourself and there's is this feeling that kind of... tells you... or gives you an idea of you gender. Sorry if this is too much, I'm just very energetic right now. But I hope this helps... :)
Thanks a lot for the detailed answer! ‚ù§Ô∏èThat all makes sense and I'm glad you've found yourself (I will admit it also helps because I'm starting out as a ""straight girl"" and a part of me still uses that against me, like I can't be trans if I'm attracted to men, which I know is stupid but sometimes I can't help thinking I'm not valid).

And you're right, I really should try to take it slowly, I'll just say I'm nonbinary for now and see where this goes. I know I definitely want top surgery, but I'm not sure about T because I really want some things but not others, thinking of low dose T to take things more slowly but I'll definitely see a gender therapist first. And with this whole pandemic thing it will take a while so I'll do more thinking in the meantime and try not to stress too much about it (easy to say, hard to do haha) üòÑ
this helped me sm ! i feel so validated honestly can't thank u enough <3 !!
Thanks a lot! üòäI get what you mean about not assigning as much importance to gender as most people do, I was like that for most of my life, saying I'm just me and don't feel like a woman and not giving it much thought, but the gender doubts creeped in and here I am, I guess after I'm done figuring things out I might go back to caring less about it, that does make sense
Thanks! ‚ù§Ô∏èAnd yes, same, I'd pick that if I only had to pick between the binary genders I'd choose to be male but I'm really neither. Also, ""soft man or visibly nonbinary person"" is basically the dream for me too üòÑ

And true, I might be feeling the need to sort of ""make up for being afab"" by rejecting all feminine things. And checklists sound like a good idea, thanks for the advice! I'll just stick with the nonbinary label for now and see where this goes
Thanks a lot, this does help! It will probably take a while for me to figure out the details of this gender thing because it's so damn confusing, but that's a really good point, I do need to take care when it comes to confusing identity and presentation üôÇ
 Best of luck to you in your journeys! It can be like, super weird, but I believe in you c:"	fkrj62	NonBinary	20	1.0	2020-03-18 15:41:07
Sad bean hours. Its amazing how we can feel so much hurt and joy at the same time in life.

Even the close ones..‚ò†		"*hugs*

I hope your wife is able to see that you crafting your femininity is not theft of her own femininity.

your joy is their poison	"And now? the Daily Shaming! We've combed tiktok to find people who have FAILED to CONFORM! Look how much they fail to fit in. Aren't you glad that you fit in enough not to be targeted by us? (or *do* you fit in enough? maybe not! better watch to find out!)

* First up here is a video of a man, but he has on a DRESS. Like a WOMAN! Unimaginable! Everyone should wear the correct outfit for their gender. It's not fair that while we're responsible *other people* get to just run around having fun.
* Next up look at this girl! She's FAT but she says she's PRETTY! Impossible! What if this catches on?? People who haven't earned the right to be happy might be happy? Then only we at the Daily Shaming would be unhappy and how is that fair? It's not!
* This one is a non-binary person but they look more like one gender than the other as far as we are concerned. YES our opinion matters. Non-binary people must wear gray jumpers and CLEAR lipgloss-- pink is not allowed.  We at the Daily Shaming are already confused enough.  Please stop confusing us it's scary. STICK TO THE UNIFORM.
* And now we have a father who loves to braid his daughter's hair! Is this DAD or is this MOM? This guy has too many muscles for this activity. And now we are getting confused again. Please stop... Why isn't he worried about what the other guys would say? Why isn't he scared of being called gay?
* This next one says they are TRANS! Look how happy they are? HOW? We at the Daily Shaming still remember that time the water polo coach said that we ""swam like a girl"" and now people are running around being trans without a care in the world. Western civilization is crumbling.
* So many people WANT ATTENTION ... but who is paying attention to The Daily Shaming?? No one thinks to ask THAT. We are the real victims. Wanting attention automatically makes you bad. More people should pay attention to us saying this. Maybe our truth bombs are just too real?? That must be it. We are NOT crying right now you take that back!
* And now for a little BOY helping his sister with her MAKEUP. HE puts on makeup too! Madness! There is no end to all these people just... doing whatever they want... what gives them the right?
* This person said they are DISABLED and talked about their wheelchair but now they are STANDING. That can't happen. We on Daily Shaming can't think of any reason why that *could* happen. No, we have not thought about it for more than a few seconds, but why would we need to?

The Daily Shaming might just seem like mean spirited voyeurism, but we'll now try to convince you that what we are really doing is somehow saving free speech and preventing SOCIAL DECAY. You better keep watching and you better keep track of all the things we don't like or you could be NEXT. If we don't do our jobs more and more people will just do whatever makes them happy and... be happy even though they're supposed to feel BAD. We at Daily Shaming work so hard to fit in... it's not fair that our suffering means nothing. You can't just say ""well I don't want to do it that way"" you have to do as you're told! These are just the hard truths of life. Even if you do everything right, you still might not be happy...OK? NO. We are not crying again! We just have a very bad cold!ü§¨üò¢

MY TOP SURGERY JOURNEY ‚ù§‚Äçü©π	"**Hello I'm Nico :)**

**They/Them**

**20yrs old**

**148lbs**

**5‚Äô4ft**

&#x200B;

**Surgeon:** Dr.Lawrence Draper

**Location:** Bronx, New York

**Payment:** Covered by Insurance

&#x200B;

I had Top Surgery (Double Incision w/ free nipple grafts) on August 30, 2021. It was the best day of my life. I‚Äôve had a smooth recovery and *LOTS* of help from my mom. This is my personal experience.

&#x200B;

# SURGERY DAYüë®üèª‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è

I arrived at the hospital at around 8:30am with my mom. She got to sit with me in the waiting area until they took me away to get ready in a preparation area for patients. We hugged each other tight.

In the preparation area I was instructed to take \*all\* of my clothes off and put on a hospital gown, cap, and socks. I put all of my belongings in a bag (Except phone for now).

I was sitting down in one of those hospital beds that turn into chairs. There were rows of them with other patients and we were separated with curtains. I spent about 2hrs here. During these 2hrs I was texting my mom, answering questions from a nurse, my surgeon arrived and marked me up, met my anesthesiologist and I got the IV in, called my mom one last time because I was being taken to the operating room!

Best little walk of my life. Just me in my little hospital socks, carrying my IV bag in my hands, walking to the operating room with my anesthesiologist. No anxiety! Just happiness!

*I felt so safe.*

&#x200B;

**Operating Room:**  I hear a nurse excitedly say ‚ÄúOmg they‚Äôre here!‚Äù That felt so nice. I walk in and see a team of (estimate) 5 nurses just preparing everything and waiting for me. I was greeted with so much love. They started getting me ready! There was a T shaped operating bed waiting for me :) The nurse opened my gown from behind, and left it covering my front, and I laid there butt naked on this bed with my arms out like Jesus Christ. Man that room was cold! As I laid there I can remember they started sticking these heating pads on different parts of my body (thighs, shins, arms,etc.). I hate to admit it but I love being pampered and feeling taken care of and loved so you can imagine how much I enjoyed this day. I just stared at the ceiling while they were getting me ready; just chilling and listening to the music. Yup! a lot of surgeons listen to music while operating so I guess my doc‚Äôs playlist was all set up.

**General Anesthesia**: SO COOL! My anesthesiologist started doing his thing, one of the nurses told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre about to go on a vacation okay?‚Äù out like a light. With the anesthesia there was no falling asleep slowly. Just OUT. I closed my eyes and opened them again and the operation was DONE!

**Waking up from Anesthesia**: I was under for around 3hrs. The first thing I remember was being picked up by multiple nurses by the sheet under me and transferred onto another bed. I felt like myself BUT dumb and very talkative. I was saying everything that was on my mind. I told all the nurses I loved them one by one and they had to say it back one by one, it made them laugh a lot. I heard one call me a sweetheart :) my voice was really raspy due to the tube they put down your throat during surgery.

**Recovery Room:** They rolled me out of the operating room and took me to the recovery room. There I met a new nurse. This was the only time I remember feeling any pain in my chest/incisions, she immediately put something in my IV and it went away fast. The entire time I was in the recovery room I was extremely sleepy due to everything. The nurse kept talking to me to keep me from falling asleep. She changed my gauze pads, taught me how to change my drains, and somehow I retained all of this information despite being high asf. I received a folder with instructions for everything anyway. She proceeded to put my clothes on; she pointed out how convenient it was that I brought a large button up shirt ;) in general I had loose clothing and easy to put on shoes.

**Discharge**: The wheelchair ride. That was cool too. I‚Äôm just having a blast this day. A staff member took me to finally see my mom! she gave me so many kisses! she wasn‚Äôt able to see me until this moment due to Covid restrictions. Anyway, we waited outside the hospital for our cab and went home :)

&#x200B;

# RECOVERY ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

&#x200B;

**WEEK 1:**

**Sleeping**: I slept at around a 40¬∞ angle with two pillows on my back, my mastectomy pillow under my arms, and a pillow under my knees‚Äîit takes pressure off your back so it‚Äôs a must!

**Drains**: Most challenging part of recovery. They were uncomfortable and at times painful.

**Itching:** After around 3 days, my skin started itching like crazy because of the tape on my incisions and my drains. It was frustrating.

**Showering:** Sponge bath from the waist down. I received help from my mom. She did everything to be honest I just stood there haha.

**REST!:** Resting is probably the most important part of recovery, rest bro. I watched New Girl on Netflix (10/10). Happy & funny. Do not watch sad shows/movies during recovery!

**Neck Pillow:** Biggest regret was not buying a neck pillow. Your neck is gonna hurt. It is a must!

**Mom**: I couldn‚Äôt have done it without her. She made me breakfast, lunch, and snacks. She gave me my pills. She helped me get up when I was sitting or lying down. She slept with me. She helped me change my drains. She helped me with everything.

**Post-Op Depression**: I had post-op depression at this time and didn‚Äôt know it. I had read about it but I strongly believed it wouldn‚Äôt happen to me. It can happen to you too, please prepare yourself for that possibility.

&#x200B;

**WEEK 2:**

**Post-Op Visit: (August 7)**

**Removing Drains:** No pain. No discomfort. No feeling at all. A nurse removed my drains and I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. However I did feel *RELIEF;* Drains out, itchy tape off!

**Seeing My Results:** My chest was still swollen which put my nipples in a distorted position. My scars and nipples looked gory. I was happy to no longer have breasts! BUT I couldn‚Äôt be happy about my results yet because of the reasons I mentioned above. Keep that in mind so you won‚Äôt get discouraged!

**Seeing my surgeon**: He was very happy when he saw me! My healing was going great! what looks gory or scary to us looks beautiful to our surgeons. He proceeded to put my dressings on my nipples and show me how to change them. I changed them every 2 days.

**First Shower:** GLORY. GLORY. GLORY. I love showering but this shower hit different. Water and soap. No scrubbing my chest of course, but I could let the water and soap run through it.

**Sleeping**: Since drains are out I could now sleep on my back! I kept sleeping with a pillow under my knees and my mastectomy pillow. It is just very comfy.

**Sleeping on my side**: I started sleeping on my side in the middle of week 2. I hugged a pillow to keep my chest (incisions) from wrinkling. My doctor didn‚Äôt tell me to do that but sometimes you have to listen to your gut, it gives good advice.

**Pets**: I have a pup and a cat. This is where the mastectomy pillow came in handy the most, it kept them from hurting me in case they randomly jumped on my chest.

**Realizing I had Post-op Depression:** It was an ‚Äúoh-‚Äú moment. It was also a ‚Äúwow i wish my dumbass would‚Äôve prepared for this and wouldn‚Äôt have disregarded the possibility of it happening to me‚Äù moment. Not knowing you have post-op depression is BAD because you will believe you are unhappy with your surgery. Once I knew I was going through it, it took a lot of weight off my shoulders. I knew I just had to be patient and not drown in it.

**Treating Post-Op Depression (+Anxiety):**

‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt like my results?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt get better?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy am I sad‚Äù

My brain turned against me. I hadn‚Äôt had anxiety this bad in a long time. What helped with post-surgery depression was distracting myself with other (easy & light) activities, staying hydrated, and reminding myself that this is temporary and my healing is a delicate process. The only way out is through. It WILL get better.

**The rest of this week**: I kept getting better both emotionally and physically. We kept changing my dressings. My healing was going so well and so fast. Receiving love & support from my mom and my friends helped immensely.

**Changing my dressings:** My mom changed my nipple dressings every two days as instructed. It was a scary process. Despite the fact that I knew nipple scabbing would happen I was still finding ways to be anxious lol. ‚ÄúWhat if this isn‚Äôt scabbing? my nipple is coming off?! why is it so pink? that looks like my human flesh! it isn‚Äôt my nipple! it came off!‚Äù Spoiler alert, it wasn‚Äôt; everything was good.

**Wearing shirts**: Swelling went down a lot. Seeing how flat I was‚Ä¶speechless. Happy.

**T-Rex Arms**: I didn‚Äôt deal with this, I felt no pain BUT I did not raise my arms higher than shoulder height.

&#x200B;

**WEEK 3:**

**Second Post-Op Visit:**

**Me**: I was in much better spirits. Swelling had gone down A LOT so my nipples were in better positions. Also a nurse had just told me that my nipples are doing great which boosted my excitement even more.

**Seeing my surgeon:** He was happy to see me and I was happy to see him :) He said I didn‚Äôt need the dressings anymore, just needed to apply Aquaphor on my nipples twice a day. He also said I could start scar-care when i‚Äôm 5 weeks post-op. Everything was great! I thanked him for everything. He scheduled an appointment 3 months from here which is December 22, 2021.

*(****Note****: I couldn't make it to this appointment so I rescheduled for February 8, 2022)*

But from this moment on, everything only got better.

# BIG FAST FORWARD :

*(I had this \[journal/report\] in my notes on my phone, I didn't have much to update this note on after my 1 month post-op so I let it sit there until it was ready to get posted here. After 1 month post-surgery it has been about living my new life while my scars heal)*

**27 WEEKS - February 8, 2022.**

**Last Post-Op Visit:** I was welcomed by a nurse as usual, she complimented my scars and how well I was taking care of my skin. This made me feel so good. Dr.Draper came in and we were happy to see each other again. He asked me questions about my satisfaction with the surgery and how it has impacted my dysphoria, I told him my chest dysphoria was gone! He took pictures of my results and said this was the last post-op visit until next year. I'm usually not an affectionate person with anyone besides my mom and emotions make me cringe a lot but I hugged Dr.Draper and thanked him for changing my life.

&#x200B;

**Other Info**:

**Scar Care**: My scar care consists of silicone tape on scars, then when the tape comes off (about 7 days, I always shower with them) I apply cocoa butter on my scars and massage them for around 10 minutes. I do this twice a day for a few days then put brand new silicone strips on my scars. Repeat.

**Satisfaction**: I am very happy with my results!

**Gender Identity:** All I know is that I am not binary, I don't fit in the category of boy **or** girl. I know Nonbinary is an umbrella term \[over agender, genderfluid, etc.\] but it gives me a headache to try to pick one so yeah, I'm just Nonbinary.

**Testosterone**: Never been on it. Thinking about it. I'm looking into what it is like to go on it for a few weeks/months in order to gain androgynous features.

&#x200B;

# BEST THINGS ABOUT HAVING TOP-SURGERY:

# 

* The increase in confidence & self love.
* Doing all the things I couldn‚Äôt do pre-op due to dysphoria.
* If I need to go out, I just pick a T shirt and put it on‚Ä¶easy as that. No binder, no preparation, just feel the shirt touch my chest and breathing comfortably.
* Wearing tank tops.
* Hot? simple solution, just take shirt off!
* Showering, turns out bathing a body you love is an entirely different experience.
* Wrapping my towel around my waist when exiting the shower.
* Being comfortable at the sight of my nude body.
* Sleeping topless or even better, sleeping in nothing but boxers.
* Laying on my stomach without breasts pressing on my chest.
* Wearing chains. The sight of my chains and necklaces when I'm shirtless or wearing a tank-top makes me feel SO attractive.
* Bubble baths! I used to wear a tank top to avoid looking at my breasts during bubble baths. Also the breasts don‚Äôt stick out of the water, my whole body is submerged now.
* Hugs. When I am hugging women our breasts no longer press against each other. When I am hugging men both our chests are flat.
* Cuddling with my pets.
* Running or going down/up the stairs without *them* bouncing.
* Feeling the wind on my torso..*.chefs kiss*.
* When sitting down, simply sitting up and sitting back! No more slouching to hide the chesticles.
* LIFE

*I didn‚Äôt rank this from best to whatever‚Ä¶everything in this list is equally amazing.*

# TODAY:

Today it is March 14, of 2022, I am 6 months post-op!  I didn't realize how much breasts and the dysphoria they gave me really impacted my personality and the way I'd carry myself until I didn't have them anymore. Therefore, the past few months have been about learning who I am and how I behave with a body that feels more mine than ever before.

Anyway, Top-Surgery is the best decision I've ever made. August 30, 2021 was the best day ever, I was born again. if I could relive this day I would, but I will settle for it being a golden memory I can replay in my head for the rest of my life. My surgeon and the amazing team in that operating room will forever have a special place in my heart; I may not know their names and my time awake with them was very brief but I will never forget the love I felt in that operating room. *Thank you!*

More Thank Yous: To the subs that were there for me during the hardest times, whether people gave me advice or simply listened to me, it helped immensely. Thank you to the people that paved the way for me. I hope I am helping those to come as well.

I know, I know, and I see you! I was where you are right now, searching every corner of the internet for posts like these...now I'm the one making them. At some point during the waiting, I genuinely thought the surgery was too good to be true, remember not to listen to that voice because it is good and it will be true. Carrying a body part you don't want has to be one of the greatest challenges ever. Good news is that all the effort you are putting into keeping yourself alive and healthy right now until **your day** comes is worth it and it will pay off! Our journey is one with literal blood, sweat, and tears. In the end, regardless of your pronouns, binary or outside the binary, *we see you* and the only validation you need is from *yourself*. Right now, stay active, exercise, rest, eat well, yoga, music, hobbies, do anything that brings you even a bit of joy and entertainment! I call it collecting happy chemicals!

&#x200B;

**IT MAY NOT FEEL LIKE IT SOMETIMES BUT YOU GET STRONGER EVERYDAY YOU ARE HERE, GO ON SOLDIER!!!**

***With love, Nico.***"	"Hey Congrats on your surgery journey!! I‚Äôm so glad you made a post like this sharing your top surgery with the world, it‚Äôs really encouraging and i found myself relating to so much of the problems you experienced with your chest and the dysphoria. I‚Äôm pre-op right now with a very limited support system (who knows if i‚Äôll find someone to accompany me to surgery) and seeing how much support and love that you had is encouraging. When my time comes to yeet the teets i‚Äôll document my journey and share it so that people like me (esp with my chest size whoo, lord) can have a reference and inspiration to keep going and achieve their dreams of body and gender freedom and euphoria. Keep being yourself and never settle for less than what you deserve! Thank you!

Came out to my best friend!	I just discovered that I'm NB a couple of days ago, and I really wanted to tell someone. My best friend seemed accepting of the LGBT+ community so I decided that she would be the first person I came out to. I'm feeling super euphoric now that I've told someone and had them support me! I am going to start asking her for help with hair styling because as AMAB I haven't had any experience with taking care of my hair. She even offered to take me shopping for less masculine clothes! I'm on the verge of tears from joy, I never felt like this before discovering my gender! There's still so much I need to figure out but I am feeling so great having someone I know accept me and show me so much support! I'm still too anxious to open up to anyone else until I've figured myself out, but having someone to share this secret with makes me happy. I will definitely keep posting throughout my journey. Putting my thoughts into words really helps me to sort out my feelings.	"Yay! That's amazing!

(also, happy Pride month!)
That's awesome, also could I have tips on looking androgynous without using too much makeup
Still another hour left in may for me
Same here!"	guewzg	NonBinary	17	0.84	2020-06-01 05:51:17
Non-binary win today	"Had a big moment today and thought this might be a nice place to share. I was at target with my family, and we stumbled upon a pride themed display with lgbtqia+ flag candles, socks etc. I‚Äôm fresh out of the closet with my family, in a place where they know I‚Äôm non-binary but don‚Äôt know what that means and don‚Äôt use my pronouns 90% of the time. Conversations usually end in arguments and invalidation. They started asking me what the different flags mean, and asked me to explain the difference between non-binary and genderqueer. I did my best to explain, being completely open and honest while using myself and my experience as reference, and they actually listened. At the end, my mom grabbed the nb flag socks from the display, looked me in the eyes and said ‚Äúis this one for you?‚Äù I nodded, and she threw them in the cart as a gift. This was the first time I have ever been able to talk about my gender openly and for my mom to actually listen. I almost cried tears of joy in the middle of the damn target. 
On one hand I am anti-rainbow-capitalism, and despise how central consumerism is in our culture and understanding of identity. Then again these these little trinkets caught my uneducated cis het elder relative‚Äôs eyes and provided a conversation starter and a tangible representation and validation that people have different genders, and that it‚Äôs okay. Just felt like a big step in a positive direction :) Ty for allowing me the space to share

tl;dr almost cried in target because my mom bought me nb flag socks"	"This is why representation matters so much.
Yay!!!! Awesome story!!!! Congrats OP, it is a huge win to feel seen and heard by your loved ones and family, especially when they are cis and actually want to learn and understand your identity and what it means to you. Happy pride month üíòüíòüíò
This made me so happy to read!

! had a similar experience with my aunt/godmother. I live abroad and we talk quite infrequently, and when we spoke on the phone around Christmas time, she misgendered me quite a lot and I was too nervous to correct her. I told myself that some people weren't going to get it and wouldn't put in the effort, and I had to come to terms with that.

But a few months later, I got a package from her, and she'd knitted me a scarf in the nonbinary colours.
Exactly! üíú
Thank you! Happy pride month to you as well!üíúüíúüíú"	vbxf3p	NonBinary	19	1.0	2022-06-14 06:51:47
I realized how much I hate ma‚Äôam and miss	"I just started working retail, and the amount of times people have called me miss and ma‚Äôam just make me cringe. Maybe if I get a binder, it could be reduced, but I‚Äôve only just now realized how much I actually hate more ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô nouns like that. 

A friend referred to me as they the other day on IG, and I can‚Äôt even express the pure joy that came over me when I realized it. 

So yeah, maybe a binder to reduce being called miss/ma‚Äôam. I wish they let us put pronouns on our name tags."	"I don‚Äôt know if your work allows you to wear a name tag or buttons, but maybe buy a big pin or something that says ‚ÄúCall me ...‚Äù. Sorry this happens, it sucks so much and just makes you feel like shit.
What pronoun would you prefer? I‚Äôd rather refer to someone in a non binary way but I guess never really thought of it before."	izvovg	NonBinary	21	0.91	2020-09-26 00:36:09
My identity is a choice.	"I know reddit doesn't like long posts, but I don't have a blog or something to put this on, so here we are.  Maybe some people will read it.  I feel like there are not a lot of voices like me on the internet, so I want to add mine to the pot.

I am posting here instead of a more general transgender subreddit because I know for certain that transmedicalists and people against non-binary genders will not hear my argument at all, and I find that there are very few here.  Also, you're my people. :)

This post will make a lot more sense in the context of the following two articles and an optional video. However, if you want to read my post to see if you're interested (or angry, as I suspect some of you might be) you could also go back and read them after.  They're way more eloquent than I am in presenting their main argument. Following is my experience.

[‚ÄúTransness as a Choice‚Äù](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/04/11/1327/)

[‚ÄúChoosing To Be Trans: A More Positive Construction of Trans Identity‚Äù](https://medium.com/@brianna.lain/choosing-to-be-trans-a-more-positive-construction-of-trans-identity-a7c67b779d2)

[‚ÄúHow do I know if I‚Äôm trans?‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2kjJT8O21U)

I am a person with a relatively high ‚ÄúNeed For Cognition.‚Äù I don't think this makes me better or smarter than anyone else (though I was super cringey in middle school when I did,) but it means I like to really think through and deconstruct things, especially my values, beliefs, and identities.  Oftentimes I really need to think about a thing *too much.*

This has been a problem for me as a burgeoning trans person, because there is a very anti-intellectual attitude in the online trans community.  *Rightfully* so, because arguing about one's own self-identity (and one‚Äôs right to have one) with dissenters is a really bad idea.  The internet says things like ‚ÄúAll üëè identities üëè are üëè valid!‚Äù and ends the discussion there.  That‚Äôs a useful, important, and necessary mantra to normalize trans identities in a hostile society, but it‚Äôs not useful to people questioning their gender who want to find out what it means to be trans for them.  The trend away from intellectual discourse, while it minimizes harm by fighting cultural hate and giving new trans people space to exist in, can actually be harmful, because it can push people like me towards the people who *do* have intellectual discussion about transness on the internet ‚Äî TERFs. I was like .5 inches away from being converted by some very persuasive TERF blogs at one point. It was a bad time and I'm glad I moved past it.

Anyway, despite this effort to be all-inclusive, the trans community does seem to circulate certain narratives.  Here are some of the narratives about how to know if you‚Äôre trans:

* If you experience gender dysphoria, you‚Äôre trans.
* If you always wanted to wear <non-natal gender>‚Äôs clothing, you‚Äôre trans.
* If you were gender non-conforming in your childhood, you‚Äôre trans.
* If you THINK about being trans, you‚Äôre trans.

These and others like them ‚Äî often directly in opposition of each other ‚Äî were all I had to work with when I first started my research. These narratives made me tremendously anxious.

‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm faking it for attention?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if this is actually internalized misogyny and trauma and I‚Äôm thus turning my back on women?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I don‚Äôt experience much gender dysphoria?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I liked being girly when I was little?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat if I still identify with women‚Äôs issues that I have experienced?‚Äù ‚ÄúAm I just saying I‚Äôm trans because a friend came out as trans and I want to be cool like them?‚Äù ‚ÄúAm I confusing transness with gender nonconformity? Am I actually playing into gender stereotypes by removing myself from gender for wanting to not conform?‚Äù ‚ÄúAm I even allowed to ask these questions? Is this actually an unstoppable train that I am not in control of?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho am I really, *deep down?‚Äù*

And on top of it all, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like something was off ‚Äî like there was something missing at the center of it all (but of course that thought horrified me, because I did not want to become ‚ÄúUnwoke‚Äù about transness and be kicked out of the leftist club.)

I finally hit paydirt a few days ago and found the resources I linked above.  This made me realize that the real missing piece here, for me anyway, is that in these narratives, being trans is seen as always\* being an unchangeable identity or fact that you‚Äôre born with.  Then, these narratives are used to gatekeep ‚Äúreal‚Äù or ‚Äúborn this way‚Äù trans people from ‚Äúposers‚Äù and ‚Äútrenders‚Äù who just want to ‚Äújump on the oppression bandwagon.‚Äù

The ‚Äúif you think about it, you‚Äôre trans‚Äù argument was created as a way to combat the gatekeeping, but it‚Äôs problematic in a completely different way. It leaves no room for cis people to explore their gender without being forced down the trans path, and can turn the question ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm trans‚Äù into a scary question about an unchangeable truth.

Okay. Here's where I'm skipping all the really good arguments made by the aforementioned articles and getting metaphysical.

The reality is, when I am grappling with my gender as an unchangeable truth to be found deep within myself, I am looking for an answer that *doesn‚Äôt exist*.  There is no ‚Äútrue self‚Äù of any kind deep down inside, waiting to be dug out ‚Äî or at least, not one supported by science.  My own religious beliefs can be best described as Atheist Buddhism, so this makes even more sense to *me*.  In Buddhism there is the concept of ‚Äúno self‚Äù ‚Äî there is no soul, no essence, that makes a person a person. There is only the travel of their body through time and space.  A person is like a piece of music. If I play the note C and ask you which song it‚Äôs from, you can‚Äôt tell me, because a note is not a song.  A song is the progression of many notes through time.  A song is an experience.  Life is an experience.

There is only the self at the present moment.  This explains why, no matter how many questions I ask of myself, I can‚Äôt figure out what gender I really am ‚Äúdeep down.‚Äù  In reality, I have been standing at a crossroads *in the present*: Will I continue to identify and present as a woman, will I identify as a woman and present more butch, or will I begin to identify and present as a non-binary gender?

The reason this has been so hard for me is that I knew the answer to that question. This is where some other trans narratives come in to play.  On some level, I *want* to be non-binary, and I had been told *by trans people* that it‚Äôs wrong to *want* to be anything other than the gender I was born as.  I was told that I should feel like I am suffering from a great affliction, the only solutions to which are death, or a fate portrayed as barely worse than death, *transition*. I was told that I should feel like I have no other option but to be trans, or die.

Well, none of this is the reality for me.  For some of my life, especially in recent years, I have felt dissatisfied with my gender.  I have never felt like I wanted to die if I had to live the rest of my life as a woman.

I *have* felt like I would be happier if I could be a different gender, but for many years I didn‚Äôt even know there were options other than male or female, and I‚Äôve known with great certainty that I am not a man.  The idea that I was non-binary bubbled around in the back of my mind for several years after hearing about it, but I never felt like I needed to consider it because I didn‚Äôt feel like it was actively ruining my entire life.

The gender dysphoria I feel is quite minor compared to most people.  It has never made me want to kill myself. I have never even laid awake at night in misery about it.  I have never wanted to cut off any of my body parts.  I‚Äôm already a pretty mentally ill person, so the unhappiness the dysphoria adds to my life is easy to get mixed in with everything else that adds unhappiness to my life.

This is not an easy case of dysphoria = trans.  Some of the dysphoria could be (and has been) solved by dressing in a more butch manner while maintaining the gender identity of female.  And, as far as what will make me the least unhappy, it‚Äôs basically a toss up between the amount of misery that gender dysphoria adds to my life and the amount of misery that being trans in the midwest *will* add to my life.

I am really *not* definitely trans, or definitely cis.  At some point the difference between a person who identifies as a particular gender and a person who identifies as a different gender can be negligent.  Both could dress the same, act the same, have the same body parts, use the same pronouns, use the same bathroom, have the same name even, have the same sexual preferences, and have the same childhood memories, and be entirely valid in each of their gender identities.

So, I actually have a choice.  This brings us back to the question I presented earlier.  My choice is that I am trans non-binary.  Why? Because I *want* to be non-binary.  Because when *I* look in the mirror and think of myself as a non-binary person, I feel joy and kindness towards myself.  Because when I feel like I‚Äôm not being gendered, I am *more* happy. Because I feel that non-binary is a label and lifestyle more true to who I am in the present, and one of my most core values is authenticity.  And finally, because I consider myself to be a bit of a conscientious objector to the gender binary itself.  In another life, could I easily be a butch lady and get along comparably fine? Yes. But to me, these feelings of self actualization I get from being non-binary\*\* are worth the pain of living in a society that doesn‚Äôt accept me.

\* For some people, they feel they *are* ‚Äúborn this way‚Äù and that is 100% *not* invalidated by the folks like me who don‚Äôt.  Some people seem to be born with an inherent interest in music, and some aren‚Äôt, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt both musicians. I will reiterate what Brianna said in her article: Some trans people feel very differently about their transness than I do. They might actually be ""born"" trans, perhaps even physically or neurologically or what have you, and not have a choice.  I think these people deserve more than simply a footnote, but a footnote is all I have to offer because I do not experience transness the way they do.  Many, many other people have written about their experiences as being *born* trans.  But I want to offer the idea that those of us who don't feel that way are valid, and don't have to justify our existence.

\*\* I have used the term non-binary throughout this post instead of a more specific term like agender because I like how general and open-ended it is.  I don‚Äôt feel the need to add any more qualifiers. I want to live in the grey space.

Edit: I would just like to point out that there is already a post on /r/asktransgender ranting about how being trans is not a choice. I am super glad I didn't post there."	"I find this very intriguing, as a fellow gender-obsessed intellectual ;) This got very long and reddit is being an ass about the character limit (it's 9508/10000) so I'll split it into two.

(1/2)  
Identity, in and of itself, is a choice, the way I see it. However, one's feelings, experiences, interests, etc, that make us come to that identity conclusion, may not be. What is an identity, if not an individual person's own conclusion of their own subjective experience, which cannot be measured or proven? I don't see anything wrong with that. We need some kinda language to communicate to others what matters to us.

This is what I know about myself, in no particular order:  
\- I was born a typical female, physically. Developed in a normal, healthy way.  
\- Stylewise, I've always been the most drawn to fancy makeup, dresses, high heels, nail polish, long hair, tinsel tassel, anything sparkly, shimmery, pretty, lacey, soft and curve-hugging. This I choose to call my ""affininity for femininity.""  
\- I've always felt as though I should have male secondary sex traits, in addition to retaining all of my naturally female sex traits, and that wish has been so strong that it was unbearable. I choose to call this my ""body/sex dysphoria"" although it is not typical of binary trans men, nor of cis women.  
\- Considering my previous point, I've always been drawn to things relating to physical masculinity, such as visible muscles and beards. But not so much societal/cultural masculinity such as bulky clothes and short hair. Basically I'm not butch by any means.  
\- I've always been fine with being called/seen/treated as a girl, woman, female, etc; and equally fine with being seen/read/treated as a boy, man, male, etc. I have no pronoun preference what so ever, and don't mind going by my female birth name. Meaning I feel no distress or even the slightest discomfort, or any euphoria for that matter, in regards to how I'm perceived socially by others or myself genderwise. This I choose to call my ""total absense of social gender dysphoria.""  
\- I've always felt like my personality is an ""androgynous blob"" but I have difficulty seeing that as a gender, without attributing gender to stereotypes.  
\- I took testosterone hrt and I loved it. It actually alleviated most of my ""body/sex dysphoria.""  
\- I had my breasts removed surgically and I hate it. I miss my breasts so bad I grieve them. I'm in constant distress over my flat chest. Thus, I want to get breast reconstructed, and I opt for silicone implants.  
\- I tried living as both a trans man and as a cis woman. Both made me feel trapped and miserable, yet I loved aspects of both.

I could add more to the list, but I think that's what's most important. Then let's dive into why I choose to identify as nonbinary, with those points in mind. That I don't seem to have any social/gender dysphoria, means that I could actually be totally at peace with going about my life as a woman, sticking to she/her pronouns, referring to myself as a woman, being called a lady, Ms., ma'am, use women's bathrooms and locker rooms, etc. I feel at peace with being viewed as a member of my female sex, and I do not disidentify from my sex, basically. So then... am I even trans at all? Looking at only that ONE aspect: no, I appear pretty cis. But there isn't just that one aspect about me.

I think I clearly have body/sex dysphoria in a very trans sorta way. Being female doesn't bother me, but LOOKING clearly female absolutely does/did, so to the point that I needed to take testosterone to the point of passing as male. But I also needed to retain all of my originally female parts, so my dysphoria doesn't feel binary male. Now being transitioned (aside from my chest issue), my body finally feels like a home, and a temple.

But then... can't women take testosterone and like it and still be women? Eh, that's where it gets complicated. Technically, yes of course that is possible. No one can or should stop cis women from taking T if they truly want a beard and deep voice, right, but is it possible socially? No, frankly it is not. Because first of all, any female person claiming to want those physical features are being told they cannot then be cis women. They are told that is incorrect thinking. Furthermore, living as a male-passing woman who does not want to pass as female, was something that I found to be so difficult in practice that it became too much for me. It isn't dysphoria-inducing, not at all. But it's very, very frustrating and challenging. I can no longer access women's spaces, convincing people of my still female sex is next to impossible (even doctors!), other women view me as a threat and an imposter, I am frequently mistaken for being a non-passing trans woman, and so on. I'm simply no longer welcome into society as a woman, based on my choice of looks. 

Oh is it misogynistic? You bet your ass it is! But what can I do about it? Realistically, in actuality, what CAN I possibly do about it? Honestly, not much. I can either suck it up and ""admit"" to being a man, or I can fight and keep explaining how I'm really a woman, but I cannot win that fight. I have essentially... lost my right to be a woman. That scares me, but I have to deal with it somehow.

And that's when I realised that I just had think of a solution to that mess. Claiming that I was simply an androgynous cis woman, despite being dysphoric and medically transitioned, was very poorly understood and only made socialising more difficult for me. I then, after a lot of deep thinking, basically came to the conclusion that considering my circumstances, passing as an ambiguous, suspiciously curvy, overtly feminine male while being bio female and proud of it, and loving the way I look - nonbinary would be a more socially acceptable label for me to go by. I understand that usually nonbinary is not at all a socially acceptable label, but... then most people probably don't transition first and then try to figure out how to label their looks.

Did I double down? Well, depends on how you look at it, but I'd rather say that what I did was admit defeat because I couldn't handle the heat, and that I use the nonbinary label mostly as a shield to protect myself somewhat. A woman protecting herself from misogyny is not compliant in the misogyny that she faces. Any feminist should know that, I think. But nonbinary is not just a label out of practicality for me. As soon as I picked it up, I felt a huge sense of relief. It, as a boxless box, has no demands on me. It says I don't need to change my looks to be a socially acceptable human being. It tells me that I can just BE and there is nothing wrong with the way I am and the way I love my unconventional body. Considering myself nonbinary... made me finally feel allowed to love my beard, deep voice and body hair - as well as my vagina, curves and pursuing new breasts. As soon as I picked up that label, a sense of wholeness and self-love rushed over me. I cried. I actually did. Problem is though: why can't I be myself as freely, as a woman? WHY?!
I can relate to a lot of what you're saying.¬†


Several years back I would have told you I'm atheist Buddhist. I still hold on to a lot of those philosophies. So maybe my perspective is similar.


I've gone through a few existential crises. I've questioned existence and strongly focused on myself. With the single greatest question always being, Who am I?¬†


I've gone through a ton of self doubt about my non-binary identity. Like you, I need to analyze and logically assess things. I need to understand why I'm non-binary and have that be valid to myself. I also need to know what that means to me and how it impacts my life and sense of self.


I partially agree that this is a choice. But I say partially because I think only parts of it are a choice.¬†


We definitely choose to embrace or deny this identity. I think everyone would agree with that. Though perhaps for some their drive to be seen and understood overrides that choice.


I think we choose to use and identify with specific labels. These are part of language and everyone understands each label a little differently. We also understand ourselves differently and might feel that a given trait or quality pushes us one way, while someone else with the same trait or quality feels it pushes them another.


I think we choose whether or not we even ask these questions at all. Sometimes this choice is taken away or thrust upon us, too. Sometimes we're not given the space or freedom to ask these questions while staying safe.


But ultimately, who we are at any given moment, who we are as the entire being that has made the journey to this day, that's more than choice. That's also impacted by consequence and chance. We're changed by our experiences. We're changed by every person we meet, by every comment in Reddit we read and write.


So gender. We are assigned a gender at birth. Society defined what genders exist, and all of us make up that society. Society decides the traits and qualities that individuals with those genders are supposed to have.


But it's more than just driven by society. It's also in our nature. It's a sort of agreement. A way to divide things up to optimize survival.


Non-binary is a collection of refound gender identities. Identities and roles that have been missing in Western Colonial culture. As a society we've reintroduced these and we're actively defining what they mean and what it means to be outside of the gender binary. In that sense, too, it's a choice.


But, deep down, who we are is a result of past choices, past experiences, and the consequences of the journey we've been on. Who and how we are today still comes with choices, but some of those choices have already been made, or were made for us in the past. Our choices today are more about how we embrace or deny the reality that we've landed in.


So, how we react to the situation of our being is a choice. Buddhism says this is who we are. This is the only moment. But I've come to find that we are more than a moment.¬†


I've come to know that we are interconnected with all reality in a way that is difficult to put to words. And in that interconnectedness, we are everything and we are nothing. And time is more than a moment, but also just a moment.


Being non-binary is both a choice and not a choice.¬†
I'm really late to this discussion but I just wanted to thank you for posting this. I'm in a similar boat and thoughts of this nature have been consuming me lately, and everyone's discussion here has given be some great insights and resources to look into.
You used the label ""rant"". Do you only want to rant or would you like to hear also different views and thoughts about this topic?
(2/2)  
But then, what about my gender? I see it in two different ways. On one hand I'm an androgynous person with sex dysphoria, transitioned, but still a woman because ultimately I've made peace with my female sex and feel positively connected to it. On the other hand I'm a nonbinary person because of my androgynous personality and sex dysphoria, but I'm also fine with referring to myself as a woman because of my positive connection to my female sex. Both of those statements can be true... simultaneously. I see them as two different perspectives of how I can choose to interpret myself. There is no right or wrong to either. But one of those labels is more socially difficult to wear than the other.

So, is me being trans a choice? Yes and no. I chose to be gender ambiguous, but I feel like it wasn't a conscious choice. I followed my dysphoria blindly, but I'm actually surprised that it led me here. In a perfect world, I still would have wanted and needed to transition medically, but I would have been perfectly fine and preferred doing that as a woman. But instead I live in a sexist dumpsterfire of a world, and thus I have to adapt to my surroundings. I don't think my sex dysphoria was a choice, even though my transition to alleviate it most definitely was. And my label as nonbinary is also a choice. But what is it that constitutes as my presumed transness? Is it my label, my transition, or my dysphoria; or all three? And does my connection to my sex erase my transness, or merely complicate it?

I leave that up to you (general you), but in my personal opinion, I'd say I count as trans, on the basis of my sex dysphoria and that I'm happily transitioned, even though I don't actually feel disconnected from being female. Because ultimately I cannot be cis. It's been proven to me over and over. The problem though, that because I do not disidentify from my sex, I have to go by the truscum/transmedicalist definition of trans to call myself trans. But fear not, I hold all definitions of trans at once.

Was I born trans? Yes, I believe that my sex dysphoria is probably something that I was born with, to my dismay. But I have no animosity towards those who weren't ""born that way"" and instead see themselves as trans for other reasons. I'm very open-minded about definitions and the like, as long as people are being honest and real, I will listen and try my best not to judge. And I find your perspective especially refreshing simply because of how compassionately and openly you deliver it. You have my respect, and I wish you the best of luck on your trans journey through life.
I strongly agree with the choice/nonchoice dichotomy.  In my post I really focused on the choice aspect because I feel like that's not something that is really....*allowed* to be talked about in trans spaces?  But here in the comments section I will take a stab at it.

I think the idea that ""who we are is result of past choices, past experiences, and the consequences of the journey we've been on"" is definitely true, and it actually also fits in my atheist buddhist perspective quite well -- in Buddhism there is the idea that everything is a product of many other things, and that includes us.

Personally though I've actually seen things as less choice-based than your average American would for a long time before I developed my current religious beliefs, ever since I got really interested in psychology.  I realized that the mind is not necessarily something we have control over.  We are truly a collection of our genetics, experiences, etc and the line between what is and is not a choice is often very fuzzy or literally impossible to suss out.

( As a quick, philosophically interesting but unrelated aside, this philosophy has made it much easier for me to be forgiving towards people for doing ""bad"" things, because they are not only someone who chose to do a bad thing, but a victim of the conditions that led them to make that choice.  I'm also less apt to worship high-achievers and do-gooders because they are *also* someone who is a product of the conditions that led them to make *good* choices.)

Regardless of whether we are literally fatalistically doomed to make certain choices or not -- which is definitely not something I have the answer to -- I think the *heuristic* of choice is very important to the human experience.  Our experience at many points in life is that we feel we have a choice, perhaps because we cannot see the future. And that (possibly illusory?) choice is very important to the human experience of life and happiness.  People seem to suffer in environments where choice is taken away from them.

When we do not believe we have a choice at all, that can lead us down a different path than if we do believe we have a choice.  It can very easily lead us down the path of misery, because instead of actively choosing the thing that the conditions of our life has made most suitable for us, we may end up ""choosing by default"" some circumstance that does not suit us at all.  Even if we end up ""choosing by default"" the ""right"" choice for us, feeling that we were forced into a certain path can sour the entire thing.

I think some of what you were getting at, is that there *is* a very large difference between not knowing that a choice exists at all and feeling like a choice is being taken away from us.  I think this is why there are so many more trans people now than there used to be in western society.  Our greater awareness of gender has led people to realize that gender *could* be a choice, and that that choice was taken away from them repeatedly throughout their lives.  Some people are reclaiming that choice by choosing to be a different gender than they were assigned.  Is it because they were somehow all along essentially the gender they choose to ""become"", or is it because the experience of being forced into a gender has soured the experience of their assigned gender completely? Or for some other reason?  Who knows. I don't think it matters or makes any one person less valid than another.

This is why I think it's important that in the trans community we reclaim our *right* to have a choice in our gender.  The only way we've been able to seek validity in the mainstream eye is by saying ""this is just the way I am, I can't help it!"" (the articles I linked go into this more in depth.)  But when we make being trans or cis *not* a matter of choice, that's just forcing another default choice on us.  And that's a really difficult default to figure out because what makes one person trans and one person not is not in any way universal, just like ""vagina = woman"" is not universal.
I would also like to drop this link which talks about the idea of why there are more trans people now [https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/07/10/why-more-transgender-people/](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2019/07/10/why-more-transgender-people/)

And also this one, which talks about how the ""born this way"" narrative hurts bi people  [https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/born-this-way-narratives-hurt-bi-people/](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/08/23/born-this-way-narratives-hurt-bi-people/)

Really though just read the whole damn blog lol
You're welcome!
I switched to discussion :)
Hi, it is kinda random but can you look at your directs  please? Thanks
This was a very interesting read!  I find it really touching that you enjoyed my perspective despite it being different from yours.

Your case is very different from mine, but also similar in some ways and also seemingly unique and thus we can relate to each other.  We're both in a weird gray area that isn't easy to define.
I definitely want to read all this and talk more. But today got busy on me. I'll try to respond when I can.
The first article is great. A lot of what they wrote aligns with what I was agreeibg with. Some parts of gender are a choice. 

I still hold that parts are not choice, at least for some (most?) people, and rather something more innate. Either by nature (genetics), learned behavior, or potentially environment and experience driven. 

The second article is tougher. I want to agree that the born this way narrative is harmful. That it might not be entirely correct, and likely isn't in all cases.

But, I don't know that the world is ready for that narrative to change yet. A lot of the freedom that has been fought for was done on the premise that sexual orientation isn't a choice. Trans rights piggyback on that basis.

I think this is a taboo subject in the LGBTQ+ community because it feels like changing that narrative could jeopardize the rights we fought for. I'm not sure that fear is unfounded, either.

Personally, I do believe I was born this way. I've dug up a lot of my past and as a kid I was really damn queer. Different traumas impacted me in different ways as I got older and I repressed my queerness. 

I was that person who chose not to be themself and instead disassociated and used escapism as a coping mechanism. But eventually that had exactly the sort of impact you'd expect. So I tried to figure everything out and rationalize and use logic to explain myself to myself. 

That worked for a while, but I never came out and ultimately sunk back into my old ways. Disassociated and escaped right up until another existential crisis made me realize this can't go away by choice.

So while I chose to live as my AGAB, then chose to just not come out, ultimately that failed and left me with a type of Sophie's choice. Either try to repress all this again, which might kill me, or embrace it and be myself, come out, and stop pretending I'm something I'm not.

It's not a unique story. 

I think folks who have an experience like mine could be inclined to believe that everyone has the same sort of experience. I don't believe this. I love how beautifully diverse we all are. In all ways, but especially experience. 

I think there's room for all sorts of possibilities. 

But really, what I believe. At the core of gender, within every single person, is some sort of fluid matrix of identity. 

I don't think any person is 100% their any gender label. I think they could identify with a more fitting label if they find one (a type of choice). And I think our gender identities can and do change over time. 

I don't really think gender is necessarily a part of who we are at all, though. At least not beyond an old survival instinct that we no longer need. Society just carries it forward because it worked for such a long time, and it's a handy way to classify people.

Really, I think we're all just beautiful completely unique diverse individuals trying to survive, find happiness, and be loved.
Np!
I definitely agree that the world isn't ready for this narrative yet.  Changing the narrative out in the bigger world right now *probably would* turn the clock back.  I mean, look at the state of politics in the western world right now. Shit's crazy. We need all the ideological defense we can get.  It makes sense that going against the born this way narrative is a taboo topic in the LGBT community because the ""born this way"" defense is all we have right now.  

It does suck because it alienates people like me.  From what I've seen on other trans subreddits, I think it also really bothers some other young trans people, who struggle to find evidence that they *were* born that way so that they can feel valid.  But also those same people are only able to come out as trans at all because of the path in society the ""born this way"" narrative has created.

However I also believe that eventually we *are* going to have to accept in greater society the narrative that people are LGBT for many disparate reasons, not necessarily always because they're born that way.  It doesn't fit my narrative as discussed earlier, but I don't know that I'm part of a minority. It's impossible to know because it *is* such a taboo topic. I know that at least there are many trans people on the internet who seem to feel very insecure in their born-trans status, and that there are others out there like me.  I can at least point to the people who's articles I've cited, and to even someone as famous as Contrapoints -- whatever your opinion on her -- as someone who has said she doesn't have the typical story that she spent her childhood wearing her mom's heels, etc, and sometimes feels invalid because of that.

But we're not just going to have to change the narrative someday because it doesn't fit people like me, or bi people as presented in the article, or whatever. We also need to change the narrative because being LGBT should be a good thing and a right, not an affliction. And that will be a great thing for straight people too. There's another article I could reference for that but I won't make you read any more >.< But essentially, as long as being gay is *bad* and an *affliction*, straight men for example are very hindered in their ability to self-express, have emotions, and have close relationships with other men.  I think dismantling the ""LGBT affliction"" narrative is going to have to be dismantled as part of the patriarchy as a whole.

(We may actually have to face this much sooner than comfortable though, because the study of genetics is growing really fast, and there is a very real possibility that soon we are going to have to grapple with the fact that, at very least, not all LGBT people will have the genetic markers associated with their gender/sexuality.  And it's important that we don't just kick them out of the community for that.)
I like reading and conversing, so please feel free to share more. I don't think you're at all wrong, either. I really like everything you're saying.

My hope for the future is more inclusivity and acceptance in all ways shapes and forms. I've never been able to understand why we and other minorities had to fight for such basic rights and why these fights are still going.

I understand even less about how one marginalized group can turn and exclude and marginalize another. The infighting in the LGBTQ+ community needs to end.

One thing I absolutely love about the non-binary community is how inclusive it is. I think you posting this here is a sign of that. I think this is the community that will finally put all of it to an end and bring everyone together in the most beautiful way imaginable.

I believe the future is non-binary. And that future is full of love, compassion, understanding, and acceptance."	f0o1f9	NonBinary	21	0.96	2020-02-08 06:52:15

NB makeup	"I'm an AFAB, and my relationship with makeup is all over the place. Realizing that both my tubes of mascara where linked to bad memories (and old as dirt) I trashed them. 

So today I walk into Ultra and get this itty bitty tube of mascara; I put it on and feel masculine ya'll! What's more is that they had a super hero themed eye shadow palate (something that used to bring me joy, but I had to leave behind when I fled home)! Because I got so much I even got a freebies!"	"Yay! I'm glad your trip to Ulta was positive and fulfilling!! Men do tend to have long eyelashes, so it makes sense that lengthening lashes with mascara could help you feel more masculine.

I also have a weird relationship with make up. I do love mascara, though. My eyes are like the only feature I have that I'm okay with, so I like to accent them. My least favorite part of makeup is *actually doing it* and having to take it off, so I don't wear it often. Sometimes it makes me feel good about myself and sometimes it makes me feel like an imposter.

i was called handsome for the first time today (:	"early last year i began trying new pronouns, and have since discovered the joy that presenting more masculine-leaning brings me.  i think i still have a lot of internalized stuff to work through, and it's been so weird feeling somewhat closeted for the first time in six years.  i recently got out of a long-term relationship and i think it's given me a bit of a push to be more secure in my own identity.  

i posted a picture of myself today that i didn't think much of, and received replies from friends that i was a ""hot boy"" and ""such a handsome person.""  one of these friends has been possibly the most supportive in my recent questioning than anyone else, however one i've never even spoken to about my gender identity!  

this happened probably over six hours ago, but i'm still riding the high of the joy it brought me.  i don't really have anyone in my life who'd understand the feeling, but i just had to express how happy it made me, so here i am (:"	That is just wonderful ü•∞	sdrng3	NonBinary	18	0.95	2022-01-27 06:14:34

An amazing friend experience :)	So I have a friend from high school who‚Äôs also non binary and I was catching up with zim. After catching up a bit I told zim that I go by any pronouns and one of zir response made me so happy. Basically I personally still identify as male and feel a connection non binary, kind of like a demiboy type deal but I‚Äôm still figuring it out. Anyways I have a huge feminine side as I told my friend and ze literally said these exact words ‚ÄúAwesome, I‚Äôll keep that in mind! Thanks for telling me and trusting me. You still good with ‚Äúmy man‚Äù and ‚Äúmy dude‚Äù and stuff? Are there any gender neutral or maybe feminine terms you‚Äôd like me to use?‚Äù The feminine terms mentioning idea part just gave me a spark of joy inside which I guess is euphoria. Ze is also the first person I told this since I‚Äôm not entirely out to people I know in terms of my gender expressions but thought I‚Äôd share this amazing moment :). I told zim that I don‚Äôt mind masculine or femininine terms but I would really love feminine terms but I‚Äôm cool with either and won‚Äôt be mad	"Cute story! Also, props on your ze/zir usage.
That's so nice! Supportive friends are the best

"""Mom, Dad, can I still tell you anything...?"" I'm nervous about this. Please validate me."	" Hi, everyone! My name is Aspen. I'm in my late twenties and identify as genderqueer. I go by they/them pronouns, and I've recently decided to start going by Aspen instead of my birth name. I've told most people, but not yet my parents. They know about my gender and are supportive and curious without overstepping, but they don't know that I've named myself, yet. 

I want to be considerate of them, though, especially my mom. A relative in the extended family just died about a week ago, and it fell to my parents to sort out her affairs. My mom was fairly close with the relative who died, though they hadn't lived near each other for a long while. Dad wasn't close with her to my knowledge, nor was I. But if I tell one of them about my name, I'm telling both of them, lol. I fully understand this. And I've held off for several days now from telling them, because while I fully believe it is a good thing I know it's also a BIG thing. I was going to tell my mom the morning she informed me of the relative's death. After hearing that sad news, it didn't feel right telling her that day, but now that a few days have passed... I feel like it would probably be alright to gauge her mood today (or soonish) and ask her if she would be open to a deep conversation or whether it should wait. On the one hand I feel like I've respected the dead and must also respect myself. On the other I doubt myself and wonder whether I should keep it to myself longer to be polite. I'm so tired of swallowing my truth to make other people more comfortable, though. I want to be considerate, not invisible.

I know my parents love me no matter what, but what's your experience telling your family your name is changing? What pitfalls might they run into that I can anticipate and help them through and past? I understand I've had a head start so to speak to get used to the newness. So I'll be patient if they have trouble understanding why I feel like my birth name no longer fits me. But I have a good metaphor to use. My old name is like an old, favorite dress that I have outgrown. It doesn't mean I hate it -- it just doesn't fit right on me, so I don't want to wear it anymore. I want to wear something that fits me as I am now and reflects my current sense of identity. I still have a lot of fondness for my birth name but it's like... looking at something you wore when you were seven, as an adult. You probably remember wearing it, but how awkward and uncomfortable would you feel if you had to wear it now? So much has changed since then. It's a part of my past, but it makes me dysphoric to use such an overtly feminine name. Names have a lot of baggage and connotations and implications that I don't want to fend off every time I introduce myself. 

*sigh*. I just love my parents a lot and don't want to upset them... I want them to be as happy as I am about finding my name! I know we can't choose how other people react, but even if Aspen is not my forever name, it gets me closer to where I want to be and that brings me *so* much joy. But realistically, I know probably no one is going to be as excited as I am. What do you think, should I hold off out of respect for my family, or be assertive and tell them my truth? 

I feel like it's possible to both be respectful of them by asking their comfort with a deep discussion and at the same time assert myself with pride by telling them how much happiness the new name brings me. 

*Aspen*. It's like I have a small, bright pearl within my heart, and every time I hear the name I've chosen used for me, another thin layer of nacre is deposited onto the surface of that pearl... And so, larger and more lustrous does the pearl grow. My identity is a treasure that has long been hidden and repressed out of fear, but now that it's safe for me to be who I really am, I'm so impatient to keep figuring out who that is and ease the discomfort I now know is gender dysphoria. I hope it doesn't throw my parents for too much of a loop, is all. My mom and I are especially close and always have been. I don't want either of my parents to feel as though I am rejecting them in any way by retiring my birth name. 

Also, I really want to hear my mom use my name and have her give me a hug. It's been too long since we've been able to see each other. :( It's been since the winter holidays of 2018 since we've seen each other! Really need a hug from my dad, too... Everyone's hugs have their own special magic, you know?"	"I think that what you've written here is very beautiful. If you explain it like this, I'm sure they'll understand. They might need some time to adjust; maybe they'll say some awkward things while adjusting, you shouldn't give that too much weight.

Ultimately, if you're true to what's in your heart, it is not possible to make a mistake.
While I can‚Äôt give you any advice, I wish you the best of luck. That was beautifully worded too.
You got this, Aspen!
Thank you. I appreciate it. :)
Thanks :)
I forgot to reply to you, I'm sorry! Thank you so much. I haven't spoken to them yet but I feel my confidence rising. I'm kind of working on screwing up my courage, hehe."	ibjy1t	NonBinary	17	0.92	2020-08-17 18:35:09
Came out to my Mum (73f) as agender (feel good story)	So I came out as gay when I was 14. I‚Äôm 33 now and have been with my husband for 11 years. Thankfully both of my parents (and my stepmum and brothers) have always been super accepting. This week I spent some time working on sewing projects with my mum and in the evenings she was asking what she should watch on Netflix. She had asked ‚ÄúIs Jonathan from queer eye going through a transformation?‚Äù (She obviously meant transition :P) I replied ‚ÄúSort of; Jonathan came out as non-binary so it‚Äôs probably not a surgery thing‚Äù (I was trying to keep it simple for her, lol) and that was that. The next evening she had ‚ÄòGetting Curious with JVN‚Äô suggested on Netflix and I remembered that they had done an episode about being non-binary and set her up to watch it. We watched most of it together and obviously some of the things that were said are things I‚Äôve been through so my mum said ‚Äúhave you ever felt like that?‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúSomething like that.‚Äù and then explained that non-binary is an umbrella term for people with gender identities outside of ‚Äòman‚Äô and ‚Äòwoman‚Äô. I explain that I‚Äôm agender which means that I don‚Äôt feel like any of it applies to me, that some people‚Äôs feelings fluctuate so some days they will present themselves to the world looking masculine and other times feminine, and explained the difference between gender and sexuality, the meaning of ‚Äúbinary‚Äùand the prefixes ‚Äúbi‚Äù, ‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúhetero‚Äù, ‚Äúhomo‚Äù, and ‚Äútrans‚Äù. I brought up that, as one of the people on the show said, having a soul that already exists outside the boundaries is part of what fuels my creative process and brings joy to other people‚Äôs lives. I am not sure she totally gets the concept but she was very supportive and I finally had an opportunity to broach the topic, which has been dwelling for years! I think now it will be easier to explain some of my style choices if I ever involved her in sewing projects that are a little weird for her taste! :P Thank you for reading. üíó	That is lovely.	10o19oj	NonBinary	19	0.87	2023-01-29 06:47:28
Sexual Identity: Human	"1 year. For one year now I have been able to identify as both non binary and pansexual. But today I've learned that apparently the only way to not get into arguments is to not go with any labels at all. I don't get why people feel the need to denounce other people's identities I don't know if they get joy out of it.

It is really sad because I really enjoyed finally getting some clarity and being proud of who I am and and wearing a Pride flag .No it's not that I am a simple human who does not like arguments ,I really love a good discussion but I just know that these things are going nowhere because people have freedom of speech and I can't really argue with opinions that are not going to change. 

Today I decided to just be human, love whom I love and do what I want without letting my gender get in the way."		hvhev5	NonBinary	17	1.0	2020-07-21 22:28:06
I came out to my mom today!	"After years of trepidation and months of working up to it in therapy - I came out to my mom as non-binary today! 

I was anxious for her response, but honestly I was so floored. She opened up to me about her own experience with gender, and how she used to wish when she was younger that she could be gender-neutral rather than female. We also talked about how the discussion about transgender issues and the options today open up a whole lot of doors for people who might not have ever thought they could do so, and if she'd known that being nonbinary was an option when she was in her twenties she might have identified so herself. 

Overall, it gave me a lot of hope -- five years ago I never would have dreamed of talking to my mom about this. There is hope and love in this world and I'm so excited to not be scared any more. 

Anyways, wanted to share this joy. Longtime lurker, hi, Zelly and they/them :)"	"Yesterday I read about a 90 year old trans woman who's just starting hrt.

Weird but good gender feels.	"I just need somewhere to get this out I guess. I‚Äôm AFAB, didn‚Äôt come across the language to describe my relationship with gender until my early 30s, I‚Äôm almost 38 now. I just went to an amazing GYN who is somehow the first person to tell me that I likely have PCOS and am hormonally intersex. I never thought it was possible mainly because I‚Äôm mostly hairless. But thinking about it, so is everyone in my pasty family, and I do have fuzzy hobbit legs and feet. 

Waiting on bloodwork to confirm, but it‚Äôs likely that high testosterone is behind a whole HOST of things that have been going on with my body for a long time. 

The treatment will be spironolactone, so I‚Äôll actually be on similar hormone therapy to my transfemme sisters funnily enough. 

I don‚Äôt believe there is/must/should be any biological basis for transness, full stop. 

Still...

I find myself having an almost hysterical bout of gender euphoria. I feel like SO MUCH makes sense now. I feel validated that my body and my mind *have* been sending me the same signals about who I am.

But what if I WANT a label??	"Trigger warning for a lot of uncertainty and questioning my validity.  If you are triggered by someone worrying what they feel isn't true, don't read, please, I don't want to upset anyone.  I just don't know where else to talk about this. 

I'm going to put a disclaimer here: I have terrible anxiety and a lot of religious trauma and stuff that is definitely clouding the way I look at my gender, and I'm going to be working through that for a long time, but my anxiety about gender has gotten to a point lately where I'm hoping to get some advice from people who actually know. 

Sometimes I worry that my gender identity is not valid, and is just some sort of offshoot of my mental illnesses that I do have.  I worry that I'm actually just cis and I just wish I were nonbinary so I'm imagining I am, if that makes sense?  Would a cisgender person even wish they were nonbinary?  But I don't feel right as a woman either (I'm AFAB) so I don't know. Sometimes I get a rare flash of joy where I'm like oh, I'm actually a boy! A very feminine boy! And then I feel happy for a minute before anxiety completely takes over.
  I look back on being a kid and go, oh those things I experienced make sense now, then I wonder if I'm just seeing what I want to see. I tend to morph into things I'm interested in, and I mostly relate to stories and romances about boys, so I was like maybe I've convinced myself of this but it's not true.  I told myself I'd try to go back the other way and see what happened, but woke up today so sick with anxiety. I worry maybe it's just cause I wish I were another person so much due to anxiety that I'm projecting in this way. 

My husband and counselor (both cisgender men) tell me to just be myself and not worry about a label.  But I think I want to figure myself out more, and I think a label might help me to feel an overarching identity and sense of belonging.  I've id'd as nonbinary possibly gender fluid for a couple years now.  I just wish I knew I was valid, and not delusional. 

I know I'm a mess.  This is a messy post, and I apologize for that.  It's been a rough spring and summer for a variety of reasons, and gender stuff is just adding to or be caused by my anxiety.  Thanks so much for reading.  I'd appreciate any advice how you all figured this out, or if any of you had the issues I have."	">Sometimes I worry that my gender identity is not valid

First and foremost youre gender identity is always, always valid. Its a genuine expression of how you identify, nobody can take that away from you.

I'd also support the idea that labels are overrated but I definitely understand that they do help a lot, especially when explaining it all.

My personal label is agender. It really helps me cut through my imposter syndrome anxiety, asking myself ""am I trans enough?"". Agender is about rejecting gender as a whole and recognising that people of all genders can present, act, dress, talk, and move however they want. You dont have to adhere to gender roles at all if you dont like. If you want to learn more youre always welcome at /r/agender
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have any advice but I do have a hug and it sounds like you need one. For what it‚Äôs worth it sounds like you have a good support system that is trying to help you in the ways they know how. From my (admittedly small sample sized) anecdotal evidence, from talking to friends, and my wife who went through a gender-questioning phases and did come out cis on the other end, these don‚Äôt seem to be thoughts that cis people have, like at all. 
It sure sounds like genderfluid or gender flux describe your experience decently, but as some lovely person pointed out to me recently labels are incomplete/imperfect approximate descriptions of your internal experience of gender which is inherently unique and deeply personal.

You don‚Äôt NEED a label to be valid, but you are also more than valid for wanting one. I hope you figure things out!
I go through a lot of these worries as well, I wish I had advice to give for both of our sakes but regardless of your identity you are valid and loved and I wish you well!
You can absolutely have labels if you want them!  It's about defining yourself instead of letting others define you.  

Now, having had my own struggles with anxiety I'd ask you to consider whether your anxiety is causing gender confusion or if your gender confusion is causing you anxiety.  Especially in light of how you felt when you forced yourself to go back.
Labels are very helpful for people that like labels and feel they help them understand - I 100% feel you on that.  Not everyone feels that way and people who don't often don't understand the drive to have those labels defined.  It's completely fine to want to know!

Something that stuck with me from a prior thread was someone saying that even the existence of imposter syndrome (feeling like you're just faking being nonbinary) is a strong sign that you're not actually faking it.  Cisgender people just *are* their gender, there's no worry or concern about being something else; they never feel like they might just not be their actual gender.  The fact that you feel like something besides your assigned gender might be right, even if you feel like you might be faking it is a sign that you're **not** faking it.  (Kind of convoluted, the person I saw post it originally explained much better)

And honestly, the definition for nonbinary is very broad!  It's basically just anyone who does not identify wholly and completely with a single binary gender.  If you feel like the label fits what you experience, then you can definitely use it.

Personally, I found the label and that was enough for me for almost 8 years.  I never told anyone or really changed anything because at the core it was always the truth and I didn't feel the need to (I had never been one to act ""girl-y"" just to appease strangers) - I'm only really changing that and coming out more at this point because I'm planning to get top surgery at some point in the near-ish future and I have a broader, more accepting group of friends I interact with regularly.  Back when I was searching, I really resonated with the fact that I had always protested ""girl"" things (dresses, skirts, makeup, playing with dolls, etc.) and was angry for years at no longer being allowed outside without a shirt to play when it was hot.  But despite all of those things, I never had much affinity for classic ""boy"" things either (sports, cars, etc.) and didn't feel like I fit into that group either.  As soon as I had found the terminology and definitions, nonbinary just felt like it fit. I've never really felt the need to dive deeper into the sub-labels; so I just leave it at non-binary for myself.
Something that has brought me a lot of comfort is generally cis people don't have the 'am I trans enough?' thoughts. Go where your heart is the most happy
Labels can be a great way to find a community and sense of self! It's not wrong at all to want a label. If you're having trouble coming to terms with certain things, why not try something more broad. I've tossed around a few different labels in my head, but decided that I just liked nonbinary. I didn't need to be more specific. You said you have id'd with nonbinary for a while now, but if it's still hard maybe just go with queer? Or just trans (though that may cause more confusion in thinking you're a binary trans man). I wish you the best of luck in finding a place you belong. Understand that everyone is different, so everyone's experience of gender is going to be at least a teeny bit different. Each label may not fit exactly right, and you don't have to pick one. But it can be  a great way to find a better sense of self and belonging.
Thank you very much for your response.  I'm not super familiar with agender, I will look into that.
Thank you so much for you kind response.  I will definitely take the hug haha.  
I am fortunate in that my husband is very supportive, he just has trouble understanding some things.  But he really tries.  
Thank you again for the support.
Aw thank you so much, and the same to you!
Yeah, that's my eternal question.  It is the anxiety or is it causing the anxiety?  Lol.  I know I don't trust my brain because of the anxiety, which is why I think I second guess my identity so much.  I worry it's just the anxiety making me question things.  (Though once in awhile the anxiety lifts and I get those brief gender-happy moments...I wish they lasted). 
Thank you for responding!
Thank you so much for your response and for sharing your own experience.  
The thing about impostor syndrome makes sense, thank you for saying that.  I am a severe overthinker and I think that leads some of my drive to find more labels.  I'm trying to work on balance haha.
Oh.....that's a good point.  Thank you for saying that.
Thank you so much for your response! That is a good idea.  I do also id as queer, I like that label a lot."	omiolk	NonBinary	18	0.96	2021-07-18 03:23:42
Coming out	"Hiiiii my lovelies I just wanna say this okay? Bear with me :3 

I've recently come to find that I feel a lot more comfortable just resigning myself from the idea of man/woman all together so here it is: 

I am Fei and I am enby :3 (and i use all pronouns)

That was all I really had to say but I'm just gonna ramble a bit cuz I'm not really out to almost anyone irl yet so I'mma leave some thoughts here. Even if I don't 100% personally agree with raising children without gender I think that might have benefitted me. We probably all agree on at least some level that gender is kinda dumb at least in the way society determines it. I just realised that as someone who's AMAB I just don't feel comfortable in the box that I'm being pushed into. You hear all this talk about ""the perfect man"" but honestly? Even if you frame that man in a positive light I'm still not gonna relate. 

Also I experienced gender euphoria! I went to the clothing store looking for a specific kinda sweater and what I'm looking for presumably can't be found in the men's section so I went to the women's section and just browsed that whole section trying to find my sweater. I didn't find exactly that sweater but I did find another one, like light minty green and on the right side of the chest area is says ""Love"" with small letters. I literally just wore that almost all day after that and it felt amazing üòÇüòÇüòÇ Gotta go get myself more of those clothes

So uhm pronounssss. I told a friend that I'm enby and his first question was what pronouns do I want him to use. Heh gotta love having a trans friend who can relate to gender confusion and stuff. But anyway my thing with pronouns (cuz I'm gonna probably have to have this conversation with most people that I tell) is that I don't really care if society sees me as a man cuz I certainly look like I'd be one and I'm fine with that. However I don't really think I always ""act like a man"" so idk. But I've had he/him pronouns my entire life up to this point so right now I wanna see how going by she/her feels. I haven't thought about how they/them would feel but I suppose it's the same level of indifference as to all other pronouns. Like I said literally anything goes üòÖ

Anyway that was my rambling and I hope you all have a great day filled with joy and love and sparkles! And rainbows! And unicorns! Hehe üòÅ"	"That's great darling <3
ü•≥üéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ WHOOP WHOOP congratulations Fei! I am also an AMAB non-binary so I can relate to this alot. You're the best of beans and I wish you all the happiness and hedgehogs! üòäüíúü¶î
All the best to you :3
That's great darling <3
That's great darling <3
üòä
Omg thank youuuu sm! üòäüíú
Aw thank youuu:3
I am amab too and agree gender doesnt even make sense. In my friendsgroup *manly* is mostly used as a red flag/ nearly an insult. I see that people define masculinity for themselves and noticed I just kinda do not want to do that for me. 

And getting to know gender euphoria was so freeing. Please rnjoy all the things that give you euphoria :)
Gender is so stupid right? And also what it does to people like masculinity is so fragile for so many people. I sort of try to redefine what gender means to me and I sail in between man and woman and just pick the best of both worlds. It's fun playing around with that :D

And yessss agreed! You too enjoy everything euphoric!!"	oydwru	NonBinary	18	1.0	2021-08-05 09:22:20
I defended myself for the first time today	"and oh my god oh my god I feel so alive right now. And excited. Someone defended me too in the comments and I'm just like crying over here with trans joy. I'm starting HRT soon and just,,,,, doing shit that affirms who I am just keeps reminding me I'm on the right path.   


Hope you're doing alright if you're reading this, and if you're not, hang in there! :D"		11mbbfr	NonBinary	14	0.9	2023-03-08 23:07:04
Little bits of affirmation	Went out for lunch with my spouse  and asked him what he wanted to try first (we‚Äôre weirdos who eat half of a meal, then swap plates with each other) and he gesticulated towards the tray and said ‚ÄúEnby‚Äôs choice‚Äù. Just recently decided to be properly out, and ended up filled with unexpected joy in the food court of our local mall. Tiny little affirmations are a delight.	"I think swapping half a meal is quite genius and not weird at all! Also yes I love these little affirmations, they just make my day a whole lot better, like the whole day Im going to be in happy vibes just because of it lol
We always run into awkwardness because we forget which meal we each said we wanted, so when the server comes to put them down and asks who the dish is for, we both sort of um and ah for a moment, trying to remember what we specifically ordered. They usually just put down the more ‚Äúmanly‚Äù dish in front of him, so he usually gets to start with a steak or burger, but I get the pasta or salad. We lived in a city where there was a large south Asian community at the start of our relationship, and it was normal to just order a few dishes for the table and be given an empty plate each so you can just take what you want. We don‚Äôt really vibe with the whole ‚Äúorder one thing each and stick to that‚Äù Western tradition, so swapping plates is a good workaround (although gets you some raised eyebrows if the place is especially fancy!).
Oh, I'm from Asia and i didn't know that people would think it weird to swap plates, though more often we just, as you said, order a few dishes and everyone just shared. Also we mostly do that cause me and my family generally can't eat that much food, we can't usually finish 1 plate ourselves, so 2 dishes for 3 people are usually just enough
Ah, we do the opposite! Order 3 dishes between two people, then ask for the leftovers to be boxed up to take home. You can get another couple of meals out of it that way, which is especially cool if the place you‚Äôre eating at is a half hour drive away and you can‚Äôt visit that often.
Oh I do get that, though we don't do that often coz buying takeout is relatively easy around here haha, honestly we would rather cook ourselves since the takeouts are usually too heavy handed for our tastes"	sxsb4h	NonBinary	16	0.94	2022-02-21 12:25:11
Gender identity as a red herring	"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been working really hard on my mental health this year and wanted to talk about my personal experience with gender. I think some people might find it relatable and gain something from it. 

Last year, I ended up at an inpatient facility for mental heath. I landed there because of a lot of my history of trauma, and I found myself spiraling into depersonalization and other issues. At the time, I was at the height of gender nonconforming but probably my worst place emotionally. [On the world‚Äôs stage, what people saw, was a really happy person experimenting.](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5FwjBjJovh/?igshid=bbvvkh4jit6e) Behind the curtain, I was really fucked up and lost. 

Once out of inpatient, I really turned a lot of my work inward. I was always seen as an introspective person, but I was filled with negative self talk. I would judge all my actions harshly regardless of good intent, good outcomes, or both. 

In the mix of this, I struggled with the trans question. ‚ÄúAm I woman trapped in a male body?‚Äù I dealt with a lot of dysphoria, especially around my hips and hair. I wanted to be more feminine, but identifying as female felt like a red herring. I couldn‚Äôt place why, but I found myself caught in a feeling of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like what I look like‚Äù and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think transitioning is right.‚Äù

Over the last week, I‚Äôve had a real breakthrough. I can‚Äôt point at exactly what worked‚ÄîI have talk therapy, an SSRI, I journal, rate my mood, meditate,  watch videos on mental health, read about concepts like self compassion. I really dug into metta style meditations, which focuses on kinder words towards myself and others. Mantras are stuff like, ‚ÄúMay I be free from suffering,‚Äù ‚Äúmay I be patient with myself,‚Äù ‚Äúmay I be kind to those around me.‚Äù It felt stupid at first, but over the long scale, my negative self talk calmed down. 

The breakthrough moment was weird happenstance: I needed to empty my iCloud account. I got a program and while waiting, I looked through the photos. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but suddenly they all looked really different. I didn‚Äôt have all the harsh judgments, I appreciated how I looked, I appreciated my role as a father and husband, and I was able to see the best in myself. I could look at my makeup and actually say, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty good!‚Äù rather than see all my ‚Äúmistakes.‚Äù

Similarly, I was able to look at my body, and the dysphoria that plagued me felt silent. For a long time, I had looked at myself and focused on how not feminine I was. Now, I saw the blend of genders and saw my inspirations in myself, like Billy Porter, David Bowie, and Prince. They embraced the spectrum and focused on being themselves. 

Nothing about this post is aimed to be terf-like. On the contrary, I have many trans friends and felt like their experiences illuminated my journey. Truly listening to them is why I felt transitioning was wrong for me. 

My problem wasn‚Äôt that I wanted to be a woman. **My problem was I didn‚Äôt want to be myself.**

It took a long time to understand that, but once I was able to appreciate me and be happy, even when alone with myself, it felt like the clouds moved and I could see the sun. At 10:55, August 14th, 2020, the sky cleared for the first time that I could remember. 

All this is very new, and I plan to continue my work. If things continue to progress well, I‚Äôm going to talk to my mental health support system about transitioning off my SSRI, only because things have never felt so positive. 

I used to wake up and dread the years of depression in front of me. Instead, I wake up and see the potential for joy with myself and my family. 

If you struggle with seeing the worst in yourself, I offer to you: **take some time, sit with yourself, and learn to value who you are.** Nothing mental heath related is that simple, and I think my SSRI did help me through a dark period. But what‚Äôs given me hope is changing my internal dialogue, forgiving myself and others, and learning that the present is the only place where I can make things better. 

This subreddit is always really positive. If you share your photo because you love yourself, continue to pass that energy forward to others. Have a great weekend! ‚ò∫Ô∏è"		ie75it	NonBinary	16	0.89	2020-08-21 22:49:00
How to come out at 47?	"This is a tough question but what I am wondering is if it might be possible for me to ""come out"" and be accepted as trans or non-binary (in trans/non-binary spaces) even though I don't want to transition medically, cut my hair, or change my pronouns (currently use she/they).  There is so much more to this so please read on before responding.  

I hope this does not come off wrong.  I have so much respect for trans and nonbinary folks.  I feel that this community is where I belong.  I have felt excluded, isolated, and misunderstood my whole life.  When I was a child I wanted desperately to be a boy.  My best friends were boys, I wrote stories from a male point of view, and I even did curls and pushups to build my upper body.  When I hit puberty (in a small midwestern town in the 80's, BTW) I didn't experience a ton of dysphoria, because not too much changed.  I have very small breasts, straight hips, and muscular arms and shoulders.  I was basically Juno, but in the 90's.  Same attitude, and very unfortunately, a similarly ""feminine"" face.  My face is what has always caused me the most trouble.  In particular my itty-bitty, teeny-tiny ""adorable"" 'lil button nose!  It's bad, for real.  And no amount of T is going to fix that.  (And, as tempting as the other physical effects might be- I've had lifelong struggles with sleep and I hear that it commonly makes these worse).

So anyway, I've dealt with a lifetime of ""big reactions"" to the words I choose and just my general way of being (confident, direct, concise, unapologetic) because it doesn't ""match"" the face it goes with.  At this point in my life I am so, so sick of those reactions.  And it still pisses me off beyond all description of words to think that I should have to modify my appearance to accommodate other people's reactions.  I'm fine with the way I look.  Sure I don't actively like it, but it just isn't a big deal to me.  I don't sit there and stare in the mirror every day.  I have long hair that is super fine, thin, and has a major cowlick that would stick straight up in the back if it was short.  There is also the fact that I hate spending time on my appearance and if I had short hair it would require so much more effort.  I mostly wear masculine clothes but it's like that doesn't register with people due to the femininity of my face and hair.

The thing with the lifetime of ""big reactions"" that I have had to suffer through is that the cumulative effect of this has worn my tolerance down to the point where I just don't give a fuck what other people think of me.  A lot of people view me as a ""bad"" or ""wrong"" woman and that's just fine.  They can think what they want.  If I ask everyone to use they/them pronouns, to me that feels like asking for respect from people who aren't capable of giving it, and doing so just adds exponential stress.  I don't want assholes who are internally mocking me to have ""they"" on their tongue when speaking about me.  To me that is far more offensive than ""she"".  For what it's worth, when I hear ""they"" from other trans/ENBYs, it brings me joy.  But I have suffered so much already (I'm 47), I just feel I should get a pass on doing the (appreciated, respected, valuable) work of asking others to modify their language.  Is this BS?  Am I being ""weak"" by staying with she/they?  Because from where I sit, the amount of pain I have endured as a result of other's gendered perception of me kind of makes me feel like I deserve a purple heart. 

I'm guessing I will fit in more in non-binary spaces than trans spaces but I'm curious to hear what you all think.  I would really like to find some community and acceptance, but the fear of rejection is pretty strong and has kept me away thus far.  

As far as ""coming out"" I have no idea how to do that.  I've (long ago) told my family and everyone that is close to me that I am queer and genderqueer, but for me, pronouns just aren't a big deal.  I honestly just don't care and it makes me feel deeply uncomfortable to think of them stumbling over themselves trying to use language to accommodate a way that they don't actually see me.  I just want to add in some new friends who do see me accurately, if that makes sense.  I don't use social media so I can't ""come out"" there.  I'm starting to feel like my mental health is at a tipping point due to the lack of community on this topic.  Appreciate any and all thoughts from kindhearted folks.  Thank you for reading."	"Congratulations. You have come out. Just by saying you're nonbinary. It is that simple. 

I get a lot of what you're saying because I'm also older though my experience has been a little different. I am choosing to make some medical, physical, and pronoun changes myself. But no one owes anyone that. It's just because it makes me feel better about myself. And you might find that becomes the case for you too, or maybe not. 

When I first realized there was a word for how I felt inside I didn't really intend to *do* anything about it except tell my friends. But then I noticed it got more and more upsetting to be misgendered, so I started to tell more people. And I have found the more I do that the better I feel. But that's just for *me*. There's people I have no desire to be out too so I'm not. I wouldn't lie if asked but I'm not gonna say anything or correct my pronouns with them. There are probably some people that don't like that but here's the thing... that's a *them* problem.
You've come out just by posting this so congrats! If it helps I identify as nonbinary (I'm afab) and still present in a feminine way, just because it's what suits my body. I don't care how people see me. People automatically use she/her pronouns and even though I'd much prefer they/them it doesn't bother me massively although I do feel a bit irked by it sometimes. You're valid no matter how you present and what pronouns you use, you'll always have an accepting community in nb spaces :)
‚Äú As far as ""coming out"" I have no idea how to do that. I've (long ago) told my family and everyone that is close to me that I am queer and genderqueer,‚Äù 

Sounds like you have already come out, and as other posters have said, your post is another coming out.   


Technically I think I have come out to different groups of real life folks at least 4 times. First was just to my partner when I was 49, followed by parents and siblings a few months later. Came out to a few friends when I was 50, and to work this year.   


We don‚Äôt have to change our pronouns, the way we dress or our names to be nonbinary. Some people do, some don‚Äôt and everyone is valid.   


Welcome to the family.
So happy to see you here! Like the others have said, this is you coming out, and so hooray, yay!!

I‚Äôm (quick glance at the calendar) 42, and I recognize a lot of the feelings you are sharing. So many years of people acting like I‚Äôm being a girl/woman wrong, which is an absurd notion in any case, but which has left some scars and some not-wanting-to-trust some folks. I think coming out isn‚Äôt necessarily a one-time thing, and it‚Äôs super duper fine if we decide how much of ourselves we want to share with any given person. Not everyone is worthy of our trust. You are valid and welcome in nonbinary spaces no matter how many people you are out to, and no matter what pronouns you go with. 

I‚Äôm pretty officially out in that I‚Äôve had my pronouns as they/them in the largest national English language paper where I live, and yet, no one much seems to have noticed, lol. (The community language where I live doesn‚Äôt use third person pronouns much at all, so it‚Äôs a bit of a moot point day to day) But in recent years I‚Äôve been making more of an effort to find more inclusive spaces, and that‚Äôs been wonderful (also painful in that I‚Äôve decided to leave some unsupportive spaces, but a healthy sort of pain I think); I have some friends now who I know are in my corner instead of feeling like people who like me might only like one part of me. And some people in my life have always seen me for me and continue to do that regardless, and words don‚Äôt really enter into it all. We‚Äôve all got to find our way through in the way that works best for us!
Yes, you‚Äôll be welcome in trans and nonbinary spaces. I know a number of trans and nonbinary folks who didn‚Äôt come out until their 50s or even 60s. It‚Äôs never too late. 

Go into it with an open and humble attitude. I‚Äôve seen a few older people who struggle in trans spaces because they have very rigid views about respectability, age, proper language, etc. But I also have seen plenty of older people thrive in trans spaces because they are capable of getting along with younger people, even when there may be differences in opinion or experiences. 

There‚Äôs plenty of other stuff in your post that I could write paragraphs about. But I‚Äôll keep it short and hope you don‚Äôt take it personally:

* You can just ‚Äútry out‚Äù HRT. If you‚Äôre worried about the effects of T on your sleep, just take it for a week or two and stop taking it if it‚Äôs really as bad as you think. Sleep problems are really not *that* common with HRT. 

* Short hair is actually super fucking easy to deal with. No need to brush it or even use conditioner. Get some high-hold matte hair cream and you can fix even the worst cowlick in 30 seconds. 

* If changing your body or appearance would make you slightly happier, just do it. You don‚Äôt need to have crippling dysphoria or hate your body to make a change. 

* If you really ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give a fuck‚Äù what people think, then why does it cause you so much stress just imagining silent reactions to using a different pronoun? If you‚Äôre a confident and unapologetic person then why are you so worried about rejection?

* Do not **ever** feel obligated to identify a certain way, use a certain label, use a pronoun, etc. Nonbinary people don‚Äôt use ‚Äúthey‚Äù because we feel obligated to progress society or some dumb shit like that. The only reason to change your pronouns is if hearing those pronouns makes you happy. It‚Äôs totally ok to use different names or pronouns or labels in different scenarios. Whether that‚Äôs for your own comfort, your safety, or because you‚Äôre just too exhausted to bother correcting someone. 

* It‚Äôs also totally ok to just not give a fuck about pronouns. It‚Äôs not even that rare for nonbinary folks. Meet a dozen nonbinary or genderqueer folks and you‚Äôll very quickly run into someone who‚Äôs pronouns are ‚Äúany pronouns‚Äù or ‚Äúwhatever you want‚Äù. 

* There‚Äôs no right or wrong way to come out. There‚Äôs no obligation to come out to any person or group. I know someone who has been on HRT for years, had gender-affirming surgeries, and came out to all their family members. But they still present as cis at work and in some of their hobbies. This person has been accepted in the local trans community for *years*. There‚Äôs no moral imperative to ‚Äúcome out publicly‚Äù.
Welcome to the fam, though you've been with us all along really :)

Also 40+, Any pronouns, I'm out at work, with friends, kinda with family (I made a post about it and left it at that really). I tend not to rock the boat, but my work does involve behavioral psychology, so here's some things I know; 

If you only tell them once, it's not gonna make much of a difference (marketing uses a ""rule of 7"" for people to pay attention to a message). 

If you have a conversation and explain your perspective, especially if there's mutual respect, I usually get a ""yeah okay, that makes sense"" response, and that increases the chance of pronoun change. I have a few core friends that use they and a couple people at work; everyone else I know either defaults to agab pronouns or avoids their use (the latter is what we do if I'm in any official announcement)

The more people use new pronouns the more likely it is to stick due to social pressure and vice versa. Starting with a small core group and expanding out from there is effective because it's gradual change and you still have a core to rely on.

If other's comments become unbearable (or you want to establish your new rules), set boundaries. Tell them what you do and don't want them to do and what repercussions happen (like ""if you use she, I will ask you who you're talking about and correct you""). They might have boundaries they want to negotiate too. By your post above, it seems like this is something that could be a strength for you :) (btw, my favorite is when someone's like ""well you know how it is for us X"" and I'm like ""well, good thing I don't have to worry about that anymore! I quit!"" XD )

*

I will say even when attempting not to look like my agab folks assume it anyway. Coming out isn't a one and done; especially for us folks that are perceived one way or another, it's a continual process. That doesn't mean you have to do it all the time though, you get to decide how much energy you want to invest in it.
Hiya! Come in, glad to have you with us, friend :) 

RE long hair: If you're worried about maintenance, go shorter. There is nothing easier to deal with day to day than a buzz cut üòÖ Anything under 10mm, so the hairs aren't long enough to bend under their own weight. It towels dry in a flash, never gets in your way, it definitely doesn't look super fem. And you can wear crazy wigs if you want to have long hair for a change.
Based on my experience I don't think you should have trouble at IRL gatherings of trans & non-binary people. I'm 45 now, and before I started HRT, before I even came out publicly, I was accepted at support groups, still presenting like a plain old cis person.
I didn't figure myself out until 40 during the pandemic, and if you're already calling yourself genderqueer you're already there! the terms weren't even there when we were younger, you know? it's never too late to be who you are!
I want to underline this answer :) Was just about to write something similar. 
I'm also older came out 15 years ago and started transitioning now. It gives me so much joy and euphoria and I wish someone would have told me before how much better my state of mind can be. Back then trans people just told me that they accept me as I am. Well, that's for sure so."	12ec8k0	NonBinary	16	1.0	2023-04-07 06:31:37
The little joys in life (re: my name)	"My wife, who has been SO supportive since I came out in February, changed my name in her phone the other night to help her remember my new preference. I wouldn‚Äôt go so far as to say my birth name is dead yet, but I‚Äôm slowly killing it. So it gave me the idea to change it in my own phone as well. 
The next day I was doing a cardio workout and got a notification of an exercise award on my Apple Watch, but it called me Elle Jay, instead of Louis Joseph, and I legit sobbed with joy from how happy it made me. It seems like a simple little thing, but wow. 
Once we move back to NYC, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll use my old name anywhere ever again outside my parents."	Your post unearthed very very old memories. I did this since I was twelve without even knowing why. I'm Tama almost everywhere. Sometimes even packages come to my preferred name and it's lovely. My country allows NB ID change but I can't swear by institutions here and I'm mostly Tama everywhere so it has little sense.	q3xof7	NonBinary	16	1.0	2021-10-08 13:23:21
help needed pls	"I‚Äôm an AFAB person. I don‚Äôt know what the hell I am, or how to know. I just remember how it all came about.

One day, I was talking to my grandma about Queer Issues. It‚Äôs already heavily established that I‚Äôm pan as fuck, and I‚Äôm confident in that part of my identity. When we got to the discussion of trans issues, my grandma said that she‚Äôs always felt like a woman ‚Äì and asked if I did, too. Well, she was more like, ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt you?‚Äù meaning she expected a yes. It was rhetorical, because I‚Äôm into traditionally feminine things. I love makeup, I love dresses, and I presented as femme pretty often.

My response was unexpected ‚Äì like, so unexpected that I didn‚Äôt even see it coming. ‚ÄúUh, yeah, I mean mostly.‚Äù

She‚Äôs obviously confused. I‚Äôm like, ‚Äúoh shit.‚Äù She tells me to talk to my therapist, I say it doesn‚Äôt bother me, and I go to think about it.

It‚Äôs been a while since that discussion. I think it‚Äôs been a year? Maybe? I have no concept of time. Ever since then, I‚Äôve been thinking about it nonstop. I remember being fifteen ‚Äì four years ago ‚Äì maybe even younger and thinking about how cool it would be to have a binder. I think about all the times that I‚Äôve been jealous of my cis girl best friend being perceived as andro. I remember trying to bring up the fact that maybe I‚Äôm not a girl and just dropping it because I didn‚Äôt feel like getting into it. I think about a lot of things.

And then comes the dreaded Imposter Syndrome Thoughts.
Here‚Äôs the big problem I‚Äôm facing. I feel like I don‚Äôt have enough dysphoria. I understand that not everyone has it, and I really don‚Äôt care whether someone lacks it because it‚Äôs not my business. But here I am. I absolutely don‚Äôt have any bottom dysphoria ‚Äì genitals just really don‚Äôt bother me. I don‚Äôt even really think about them. But there are times where I have some Rough top dysphoria. It‚Äôs just so rare, though. I really hate it when others point out my chest, and I hate calling them breasts to the point where I didn‚Äôt even like typing that. But I can point them out fine? Most of the time? And I don‚Äôt really care if someone refers to me by she/her pronouns. I‚Äôd prefer they/them but I don‚Äôt get dysphoria from it.

I‚Äôm just really confused. There‚Äôs not a day that goes by without me thinking of what the fuck is going on, and it‚Äôs been like that for a while now. I keep thinking about coming out, but then I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm just faking. I can‚Äôt wait for the day that I can get a binder, just so I can go as masc when I feel like it, but what if I‚Äôm just butch?

Even writing this I‚Äôm confused. I think I‚Äôm NB. I like being NB. The idea of being seen as andro even when I‚Äôm leaning heavily femme or masc brings me joy. I want to be able to wear makeup and a dress and still have people question what gender I am. That‚Äôs my goal. But I‚Äôm still just. Feeling weird, I guess? Do cis people ever feel like this? Is this just an average thing? Could someone help me out?


Sorry if this is confusing to read, and extra sorry if this isn't allowed.

Edit 1/12: I wanted to say thank you for all your help. After making this post, I decided to come out. Hearing all of your advice, from all of you, really helped me. I recently told my therapist, and have an appointment at a trans clinic near me in March. I‚Äôve honestly never been this happy with my identity. I‚Äôm still getting used to things [like binding ‚Äî I hate it a lot but it helps] and oddly enough, still getting used to my name. But I have support, so I‚Äôm lucky there. Thanks again, everyone!

Edit 3/8: Hey! I‚Äôm currently in an appointment with a gender therapist and working towards getting top surgery. It‚Äôs a good day."	"Here's the thing: you are judging yourself too harshly. Would you demand all those things from someone else, to justify their gender? 

You need to accept how you feel, and if you are not sure how you feel, then give yourself time. 
I get you. 

I literally just realized that what I've been feeling for the past ten years is dysphoria. To a T. But a part of me feels like it's not ""dyspohoric enough"" if that makes sense. Like I'm fine with my parts - mostly. Like in my case I'm totally split. Sometimes I feel sexy with the top that I have and other times it annoys me. I'll cross my arms over my chest and feel like ""that shouldn't be there"". It's confusing. And then as for bottom dysphoria I'm really happy with what I have (I'm afab) but I also wish I had a dick. I've used she/her pronouns my whole life but I feel like I'd respond just fine to any of them. 

But, I don't know, I think about it a lot, especially recently. I alternate between feeling like I'm not pretty enough to ""be a girl"" but not ""thin enough/handsome enough"" to present as a guy. I feel like any attempts to present more masc would just be laughed at or I'd just get written off for being butch (not that there's a problem with that, per se, it's just not what I'm going for). I've identified as a lesbian for a long time but like... if my gender is in question I feel like my sexuality is too. Am I pansexual and genderfluid? Am I more fluid cis female and lesbian? Am I a straight guy? I just don't know.

I think in the end I'm better at giving advice than following it, but here's my two cents anyway. Try not to ruminate on this too much. Go with what feels right and kind of take things day by day and moment by moment. Feeling more feminine one day does not invalidate feeling more masculine another day. What you're feeling is real and it's ""real enough"" (I need to learn this myself). Give yourself time and space and patience. Definitely patience. I totally get wanting to know all the answers and knowing them NOW. But no amount of fretting is going to make the answers any more clear or immediate. Just focus on what you're feeling and take little steps to explore aspects of your identity and move in the direction that feels right. 

And, lastly, it's totally okay if what you're experiencing changes over time. It doesn't make you any less valid. It doesn't mean you were faking or lying. If you're nonbinary and that's how you see yourself, then that's what you are. If you want to find more specifics or explore what's under the umbrella of nonbinary then pursue that. Find what fits. Try it on, so to speak. And if it doesn't fit or click, don't worry and go ahead and try something else. I know it's corny and cliche to say ""just be yourself"" but it really is a good maxim - go in the direction that brings you the most happiness and confidence and worry about the specifics later.

Sorry if this was a bit of a ramble but I hope it helps or at least made you feel a little less alone.
Tbh live your best life‚Äîignore any notions of gatekeeping (i.e.. questions of whether your trans enough‚Äîyou are). Trust yourself. You‚Äôll figure it out over time. In the meantime, make little changes and see what feels nice. 
One of the reasons I'm such a fan of having ""nonbinary"" as an identity is because we gender too many things for no reason. If you want to indulge in ""girl stuff"" it's not because you're a girl/woman, it's because you're you. So try to relax, present how you feel comfortable and like your best self, and try not to beat yourself up about not being (something) enough. It's something I think most of us NBs go through because of how gendered life is in weird ways and it's hard to break free of that sometimes.

You're good, I promise. :)
It's ok to be confused. Go with whatever label you want - or no label at all. I wish I didn't have tits, that I was more naturally androgynous, but like you, I don't have any desire to have a penis or any surgeries at this time. 

I don't care what pronouns people use to refer to me as long as they're being respectful. I have an old lady name, so most people use she/her.

Hang in there. I don't think you have to have a certain amount of dysphoria to qualify as non-binary. You do you.
This is not a common experience for cisgender people, no.  You say you only have top dysphoria rarely, but hating talking about your chest using certain words that much or having people paying attention to it (I'm assuming even in a non-sexual, non-creepy context) is not a common cisgender experience.  Preferring they pronouns is not a common cisgender experience.  Thinking about and questioning your gender identity daily is not a common cisgender experience.  I'm not saying it's impossible for a cisgender person to do these things, but it's certainly not something the majority do.

Do you regularly identify/present as butch?  Does the thought of that appeal to you?  If you do, are you happy with it?  If the answer is no, does butch really seem like the right term for you?

You know better than anyone else what you are, and only you can make that decision.  In my personal opinion though, it seems like you already have your answer.

All I can suggest is to try and find spaces where you can experiment with your identity.  Is there any kind of trans drop-in place in your area where you might be able to get a used binder?   Do you know anyone who'd be down with trying out using they pronouns for you in safe situations?  If there's other stuff related to your gender presentation/identity that seem appealing to you, can you find a small way to try em out?  You don't need to jump in the deep end right away!  But you might find that it's a bigger deal than you realized."	7jg7ut	NonBinary	16	0.88	2017-12-13 02:53:56

Daughter came out as non binary need education about what it means. Please guide.	"My daughter recently came out as non binary. We are a very supportive couple and love her to death and are willing to do anything for her. She was going through a few months scared that we won‚Äôt understand and told her friends in confidence. One day she just broke out crying very emotionally and wouldn‚Äôt tell us anything. We were so puzzled as she wouldn‚Äôt tell us anything. Finally we read a piece of chat where she told her friends I am scared how to tell my parents. We immediately talked to her told her you have our full support no matter what you want to do in life. She hugged us and had a huge relief, smile and joy on her face. I was just crying tears of joy and relief along with her. 


Obviously we will set some rules around dating and consuming certain things until she is older but our love for her is true, unbiased, unlimited and not based on any conditions. When she was younger I had also casually mentioned to her would you like to marry a boy or a girl and had even brought up being gay and lesbian is perfectly fine. I was surprised that despite that she still felt this way so that tell me I need to communicate and spend more time with my daughter. 

I am straight and I am new to different ways people express their sexuality and expressions. She wants to be called a person, by name or them and they. Can you please guide me and help me more:
1. Understand what non binary can mean
2. How can I help my daughter apart from supporting her wishes and being fully open 

I fully support you all and HUGS AND KISSES to all whose parents, family, society do not support you.  You have my undying and unlimited love. Please have a talk and bring up your sexuality with your friends and your parents. Especially if you are independent. Not sure if this is something that go against certain religions and parents may oppose it but God‚Äôs language is of love and light so opposing a pure thought or expression that came straight from the heart is denying god‚Äôs expression and love. Hating you is denying love to and from god. Love you all pure souls."	"I can see how much you care about your child and I hope I can help. 

A big thing that will support your kid is they‚Äôve said they want to be referred by they and them - so instead of saying ‚Äúshe wants this‚Äù you would say ‚Äúthey want this‚Äù, instead of ‚Äúthis book belongs to her‚Äù you‚Äôd say ‚Äúthis book belongs to them‚Äù. It might be confusing at first but I‚Äôm sure with practice you will get there! 

Being non-binary can mean different things to different people, but the key factor for most is feeling as though you are not a guy or a girl. Some people feel like that means their neither, or a mix of both, or really anything that doesn‚Äôt fit into the binary labels of boy or girl (hence the name non-binary). 
It might be a good idea to have a chat with your child and ask them how they feel being non-binary is to them. 

Reaching out to the community and trying to understand and be supportive is a great start to supporting your kid and I wish you the best!
I had to read through twice but i think you might be confusing gender with sexuality. Non-binary is a gender identity it doesnt have anything to do with your sexual preferences. 
The best place to start would be to look up your local pflag organization and see what resources they have. Another great way would be to read some books by trans authors.

To answer your first question non-binary is generally used as a sub group of the trans umbrella. The most common definition of trans is someone who does not identify with their gender assigned at birth. After that you get binary trans people (people who identify as men and women) and non-binary trans people. The non-binary umbrella is huge and there are many ways to be non-binary. I would ask your child how they personally identify although if this is new to them they may not be fully able to put it into words yet. Having said that there is also some nuance i left out for example not all non-binary people identify and trans, however that should be enough to get you started. 

To answer your second question i would say, step one do your own reasearch. As a newly out trans person the burden of educating everyone around you is a lot, plus it will show your child that you care enough about them to make the effort. Second, believe them when they tell you how they feel, i know this probably sounds silly but many parents go with the ""this is just a phase"" approach which is very damaging. 

There is probably a lot more to say but you are off to a very good start! Good luck.
This is great news I'm so impressed by their being able to come to you like this. And good on you for raising a confident kid!

There are a couple things that helped when I came out to my parents:
Think of a time when somebody told you you werent man/woman enough.
Think of a time when you wanted to do something but were afraid to do it because it's ""just for guys/girls""
Find five children's books, read them with special attention to the genders used. Every time a new character is introduced ask ""how did the other characters know that this new carachter is a boy/girl""?
Yes you are right is seems different but not wrong at all.  It is an individual souls‚Äôs person‚Äôs request and just because I am older than them and not a non-binary does not make somehow in a better position to ‚Äòjudge‚Äô or try to control them. I love them from the bottom of my heart and there are no conditions for that love. Thank you so much! Yes we will continue to have more conversation around that.
Thank you so much. I agree we need to talk more to them. Thank you so much. Yes people not close to them think this is a phase. I believe this is who they thinks they are right now. Who am I to say anything only they know. Thinking of it as a phase is invalidating their thoughts and I want to be the last person to do it to my kid.
Thank you! fortunately they are strong willed and I believe am also open minded to support that. They are not someone who is tied up in one gender or the other and we have also supported that full heartedly.
Do you have any books that will help. Really appreciate it.
I'd recommend trying to find LGBT+ parent support groups.  There are many parents out there going through the same thing you are.  Your child's not alone and neither are you."	l0lgr7	NonBinary	15	1.0	2021-01-19 14:59:39
Binding	"Does anyone else feel massive levels of joy when they bind? 

It legit feels like I look the way I‚Äôm meant to, which is odd because I have zero desire to transition but feel very much like top-surgery is what‚Äôs needed to address my enby dysphoria."	"Yuuuup. Even wearing sports bras & oversized shirts to minimize it makes me feel better.
This is literally me.
I completely get this!! I personally have no plans to get surgery, but 9/10 days I feel more genuine while binding. Definitely makes wearing button downs and tight t-shirts more comfortable and fitting
Oh if this ain't a big ol' mood. I'm very much on the masc side of the spectrum and whenever I see myself while bound it feels so RIGHT. It's like the stars align or something."	dngzrg	NonBinary	14	0.9	2019-10-26 17:33:07

I take all the validation I can get	a kid I babysit keeps asking if I'm a boy or a girl. I never dare to explain her because I am afraid how the parents would react if they knew, but in a way it makes me feel joyful. adults and most of my peers just assume I'm a woman and it's neat that this little girl gets confused by me presenting in a more masculine way! 	Kids are smart and are used to learning new stuff about the world. It's just sad that a lot of adults have lost this.	9usjuz	NonBinary	13	0.94	2018-11-06 21:21:42
"""Attack Helicopter"" Joke"	"I know the ""I identify as an attack helicopter"" joke is quite old, but after having seen it re-emerge in a friend group that I'm in, and having it sort of directed at me, the non-binary of the group, I don't quite find it too offensive.

I personally feel it's just a satirical approach to the rapid development in gender identity and how rapid it is, not to mention the unfamiliarity of it all to people who aren't very active with the LGBTQ+ community. I thought it was sort-of funny when it was floating around, and not really anymore as it's really lost it's taste over the years, but I still manage to respect it as a joke, rather than some anti-queer person who spouts anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric.

I'd really like to know how you joys all feel about it, as it's a big discussion amongst friends of mine!"	"It can be funny when it‚Äôs used by trans and nb people. But when cishets use it, it‚Äôs almost always rude and targeted at trans people. It‚Äôs great that you‚Äôre not offended by it, but trans people have every right to hate the joke.

It‚Äôs not even a funny joke to begin with
the basis of the joke is, ""well if people can be trans why can't I be something ridiculous as well?"" and I don't think that's funny at all. there's no attempt at nuance or understanding or even tolerance
My xenogender ass just neopronouns them lightning speed. ""Is it hel/heli/helics pronouns?"" 

I have no time for a bigot joke that was stale when it was new, let alone one so musty I wouldn't feed it to a seagull.
It being offensive is circumstantial. I typically dont take offense to it, but one specific time, I did. My coach said something like ""... If you ever have a boyfriend, girlfriend, partner..."" (he knows I'm nb) and a teammate laughed and said ""attack helicopter"". I did get offended by that because my coach was intentionally inclusive, and this kid made fun of it. So, generally speaking, it's fine but dumb. Sometimes it is pretty insensitive and rude tho.
It doesn't affect me too much either, it's just a bit annoying
I actually briefly dated a non-binary person who identified as an Apache Attack Helicopter because ‚Äúthey‚Äôre awesome, who wouldn‚Äôt want to‚Äù. They used They/Them and honestly gave off really good vibes, and I always made sure to use their correct pronouns. The whole ‚ÄúI identify as an Apache Attack Helicopter‚Äù always felt a little odd to me though. I never said anything about it and did my best not to judge, because really, it‚Äôs not my place, but after we decided on a mutual breakup it was still one of those things I kept thinking about. It kind of started to feel like my queerness was a joke to them?
I agree entirely, and I've seen it be used recently in the more derogatory way, of course it can always be a bit of light-hearted fun, but I feel it crosses the line when a MAGA wearing transphobe wants to push their garbage agenda.

At the same time, at least in the beginning of the joke, it sort of shed some light onto new identities. I just suppose the people who are mature and accepting of LGBT people took it light-heartedly, and then people who only thought it was funny because they saw the identities as ""fake"". I just guess the latter of those are more prevalent."	iq2i7h	NonBinary	14	0.78	2020-09-10 12:39:35
Struggling with letting go of old toxic ideas (and wanting to medically transition which isn‚Äôt possible right now).	"Okay so I‚Äôm non-binary/genderqueer (I‚Äôm comfortable with both). I‚Äôve known since I was 13, and I‚Äôm pretty secure in the knowledge that I‚Äôm not cis. There was a while when I had just figured myself out that I got sucked down the Kalvin Garrah rabbit hole (he was the first trans YouTuber that I found and my first introduction to the whole truscum/tucute communities which I try to avoid now) and it ended up with me feeling like I had to look vaguely masculine to be non-binary (and also with so much internalized transphobia). I was in a really bad place mentally and I think I clung onto that ideology to hide behind my own self hate and unbearable dysphoria. Even on the days that I felt less dysphoric I would end up sabotaging that because I felt as though I had to be very dysphoric all the time 24/7 to be a ‚Äúreal trans person‚Äù. Luckily I never joined the hordes of Kalvin stans who go out and bully people who they deem to be ‚Äútrenders‚Äù (oh how I hate that word) because even at my lowest I knew that it was an awful thing to do.

I eventually got out of it once I started therapy and became more well adjusted and happy with myself as a person. I started to feel sick at the way Kalvin would talk about people, and the utter hate and anger I could see rolling off him in waves. I recognized how even if I agreed with a lot of his opinions, the way he went about things and the things that he did were unforgivable. Eventually after doing a lot more research and meeting other trans people and seeing how they lived and the vast complexity‚Äôs of their genders/lack there of, I stopped agreeing with a vast vast majority of his opinions as well and the few that I still do, I think the way he goes about them is disgusting. In seeing trans joy, I was set free from the cage I had put myself in, where I believed that I would never achieve happiness as a trans person.

Which brings me to now. I‚Äôve been exploring my gender (well, lack of gender I guess) which is something that I would never let myself do before because I thought that I didn‚Äôt deserve joy (as a trans person, and just in general) and because I was worried that I would find something that would go outside of the right set of rules that I had set myself to be a ‚Äúreal trans person‚Äù. I‚Äôve realized that while they/them makes me feel euthoric and it just feels right, I‚Äôm actually okay with he/him as well (although I‚Äôd still much prefer they/them) because it doesn‚Äôt make me dysphoric, and that sometimes I much prefer male terminology to gender neutral terminology because it‚Äôs less of a mouthful sometimes and it can flow better. I‚Äôve also found that I actually really like feminine and masculine clothes, and that if it didn‚Äôt make me so dysphoric to be seen as a girl I would love to wear dresses (unfortunately they bring attention to some parts of me that make me really dysphoric, but they‚Äôre hella cute) and I would like a beard eventually. 

The thing is, that even though I‚Äôve let go of all those toxic ideas, and judgements that I had before, and I‚Äôm completely fine with other people doing and feeling the things that I do, I still struggle with it when it comes to myself. I know that wanting to wear feminine things as an afab non-binary person doesn‚Äôt make me less non-binary but there‚Äôs still a part of my brain that goes ‚ÄúBut that must make you a cis girl‚Äù (Just want to emphasize that I don‚Äôt actually believe this in general, this is just an illogical feeling from clinging onto toxic ideals for so long. If you‚Äôre an afab enby who is feminine then that‚Äôs hella valid). I know that having both top and bottom dysphoria and wanting a more masculine body (and wanting to go on T) as a non-binary person doesn‚Äôt make me a trans guy but there‚Äôs still a part of my brain that goes ‚ÄúBut why would you want to look like a man if you‚Äôre non-binary?‚Äù (Again, I don‚Äôt believe this logically, and my brain doesn‚Äôt apply it to anyone else, just me. If you want a masculine body as a non-binary person then that‚Äôs hella valid as well). I could talk this all over with my therapist but I‚Äôm not sure that she would actually get it, because she‚Äôs cis and doesn‚Äôt really know the ins and outs of trans politics.

I‚Äôve also been struggling because I want to start wearing more feminine stuff and more masculine things but because I still look very fem and don‚Äôt ‚Äúpass‚Äù whatsoever, it makes me too dysphoric. I really want to go on T and get top surgery, but I still live with my mom and I‚Äôm not out to her plus I‚Äôm still slightly too young (I‚Äôm old enough to go on T, but the process will take ages in my country and I‚Äôm scared of my family finding out). Also I don‚Äôt have enough money. The only win I‚Äôve had lately is that I managed to get an undercut (I‚Äôm not allowed to cut my hair short) and I‚Äôve secretly ordered a packer. I‚Äôve been watching videos of people getting top surgery and crying because I‚Äôm happy for them but I really really want that. 

I don‚Äôt really know what this is. Maybe I‚Äôm hoping to find that I‚Äôm not alone in feelings like this. Maybe I just needed to get all of this out in words so that I can stop keeping it inside of me. Sorry if this is confusing or I‚Äôve made any spelling mistakes. English is my first language but I‚Äôm typing this on an iPad with autocorrect and tiny lil hands."	" Are you literally me?

 I'm an agender person who transitioned on T and who wants top surgery. I use masculine pronouns and words because they're convenient (and I look male). I don't consider myself male, but I want a masculine appearance, and I definitely don't consider myself female, but I wear feminine clothing. I also fell down a rabbit hole of enbyphobia/extreme transmedicalist beliefs when I was younger (I'm 20 now). 

 And I am an entirely valid nonbinary person. You are too. 

 I understand how hard it is to apply those beliefs to yourself when you've spent so long thinking that you're not valid, that you must be one or the other and can't just be neither- but I'm here as someone who went through basically the exact same thing to tell you that you can. You can do whatever you want with your presentation: cis men who like pastels or doing drag aren't magically women when they do those things. And in my opinion, wanting a more classically 'masculine' appearance doesn't dictate gender any more (consider cis butches). Ultimately, whatever you want to do to feel comfortable in your own skin is just that. It doesn't say anything about you beyond 'this is what makes me happy, and this is how I want to look'. 

 Good luck OP. And congrats on your haircut! Undercuts feel great c:
A lot of us struggle with internalized transphobia. It's tough but it's something you're strong enough to overcome. If you're able, could you look into gender therapy? If transition isn't an easy option right now, focusing on overcoming these phobias and loving yourself could really help, and make the process all the more rewarding and affirming when it happens.
Thanks you :) I‚Äôm loving it so far. It actually really helps to know that I‚Äôm not alone and that other people have had similar experiences and unlearned those things. I hope that you have a great day!

Loving my new haircut!	Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get a picture that I feel really shows it how I see it when I look in the mirror, so I'm not going to post a picture. But I finally got my first haircut since I've discovered that I'm nonbinary (and I was so nervous!) I didn't really know what I wanted or how I would wear any style I was looking at, but looking at what I ended up with really brings me a lot of joy right now. There are still many things about my body I want to change, but at least I feel that my hair has achieved wonderful androgyny!!!	"Congrats! I just did the same thing! My hair sucks and I can't grow it out nicely anymore, so my wife did a nice assymetrical undershave for me. I haven't done that kind of thing since my punk years ages ago. It feels cool, I probably look very strange but I like it. It gives me good enby vibes.
It feels so good doesn't it? I recently had mine cut at an LGBTQ+ friendly barbers and after describing what I wanted she asked ""are you non binary?""; she then adapted the cut accordingly. It was great to have a place be so laid back about it.
It is great! I was recommended my guy from someone I met at an LGBTQIA+ support group near me. I felt pretty bad though because I had no idea really what I wanted or what would work with my hair and face.
That's essentially how I approached it, I had some pictures I liked from their Instagram page but besides that I had no idea what would work with my face shape or my hair type. The outcome seems to work though"	e8k4ph	NonBinary	15	1.0	2019-12-10 02:17:30
am i too feminine to be non-binary :(	"hey howdy! longtime lurker here. i‚Äôm AFAB and currently have very long (think waist-length) hair. i have a high voice (soprano gang rise up üò§). but i‚Äôm not a woman and i feel so much joy when im referred to as they/them. do i have to cut my hair to be a ‚Äúreal‚Äù non-binary person? i asked my lovely wonderful boyfriend to call me they/them and every time he does i just feel like an imposter. sometimes i just want to shave my head because i feel like such a faker. the only time when i feel somewhat ok is when i put my hair in a bun and then i can just love being THEY and not SHE. but i love my hair and it gives me so much confidence and i‚Äôm really proud of how long and healthy it is. i would love some advice or help (even if it‚Äôs just to tell me i have to cut my hair üôà) thanks in advance you lovely people <3

TLDR: do i have to cut my very long hair to be valid and non-binary?"	"Being non-binary comes with no restrictions or requirements for how you present yourself. That includes names, pronouns, clothing, hairstyles and anything else. Non-binary people are non-binary, regardless of the length of their hair. Hair length is a presentation choice, something you *do*. A gender is something you *are*.
you dont have to do shit to b non-binary. if ur gender is outside of either strictly man or woman, ur non binary. it's not a ""third gender"" with strict rules for behavior and u don't owe anybody androgyny within ur expression. u like ur hair? it gives u confidence? keep it. u could 100% look like a ""woman"" and still be nonbinary and anyone who says otherwise is a fuckin idiot &u dont owe them anything .peace ‚úåÔ∏è
No, non-binary describes who you are. Your gender expression is valid no matter what.
No. You can have any hair you like and be non-binary. You are valid.
TLDR answer: you absolutely do not have to cut your hair, you are valid non-binary right now, simply because you chose the label. I'm a very different flavor of non-binary, and we both are non-binary, and that's because we have enough freedom to pursue being our genuine selves, in whatever form that takes.
Hair is hair, and hair length has no gender. My own hair reaches almost to my knees, and I am absolutely no less nonbinary for it.
The only faker is the person who says you aren‚Äôt nonbinary because of how you represent
Gender is a social contract made by bathroom companies in order to sell more bathrooms
There is no wrong way to be non-binary!
I plan on medically transitioning to be more masculine, I have basically the same goals as most trans men as of now. Is this too far? Nope. 

Right now I have long hair as well, feminine body, expression, everything.
I will always be non-binary though. I'm just as non-binary in my feminine form as in my future 'guy form'

Putting rules on how to be a certain gender would be stupid and limiting.
You ARE non-binary no matter how you look or sound like. If you don't want to cut your hair then don't do it, it's as simple as that. Still non-binary enough!"	mnujvq	NonBinary	14	1.0	2021-04-10 00:43:16
It's my first Name Anniversary!	"One year ago, I introduced myself as my chosen name for the first time irl. I've been so lucky to have such acceptance and joy around it!

I am so confused and conflicted and not a man	"It JUST clicked that I really don‚Äôt identify as a ‚Äòman‚Äô. I just had no idea it was possible to think of myself like this. Like wtf. I have no idea what other non-binaries are like but my entire life makes sense now and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs so confusing. Like, super athletic little boy, sensitive, doesn‚Äôt want to step on grass bc it might hurt it, grows up, likes girls, has plenty of success but also gets called gay by both other girls and boys in social settings - not even from any mannerisms but for things like loving The Little Mermaid and freaking out about puppies and cute chubby babies.

I was seen less as ‚Äòme‚Äô the more I shared my joy.

I never became a douche about it. But I stopped being me. My skin became a prison and it is breaking my heart rn for that poor little boy who became afraid of his own joy. 

I feel betrayed but nobody seems to be to blame. We were all young. Or maybe that‚Äôs not an excuse? I think it is, but it isn‚Äôt. So I am conflicted and crying and maybe I‚Äôm finally realizing my joy was never to blame.

Other people, maybe or maybe not. But my joy for beauty and love as a straight man in this life has been the closet-homosexual-relationship of the 21st century.

There‚Äôs something about time to it all for me. Why am I ok with the idea of a little boy but I reject the label of ‚Äòman‚Äô?

We not only differentiate gender with these words but we imply boyhood is gone and I reject that. I have out parts, I like people with in parts. I understand life is easier to talk about with labels but humanity did a really bad job of labeling.

The only thing we‚Äôve done right as a label = categorically rejecting the labeling convention, and giving that a name.

I do want tons of sympathy because I am shattered rn, but what is my responsibility at work? I‚Äôve never seen non-binary labels (in email signatures) but I feel that I should maybe do it. 

Do people understand?"	"I get you. Sending love üíú
I‚Äôm here for this, and for you.

I can empathize with what you‚Äôre feeling right now and while almost no one out there in your world will accept or understand what you‚Äôre feeling, there may be a few who will.

I began re-embracing my own joy a few years ago and most people don‚Äôt get it, some are even passive aggressive‚Ä¶but I carry on expressing myself‚Ä¶I find new ways to push the envelope‚Ä¶I brazenly step over every line drawn before me and I refuse to stop.

I feel like you can find the strength to do the same because if people like us don‚Äôt start the conversation, people like us will never be accepted and understood.
Humanity has a lot of different ways of using words. Just cause we‚Äôre not represented today doesn‚Äôt mean we always were invisible, and it *definitely* doesn‚Äôt mean we always will be. A hell of a lot of us relate to you! And we want you to not only feel seen but be able to just live your life without rigid expectations and limitations.

I had a very hard time letting go of childhood because it was the end of my time being able to be seen outside of gender, it felt like every stage of growing up was further and further differentiated by binary gender, and the walls just Kept Closing In. It‚Äôs not that I wanted to be a kid, but I certainly wasn‚Äôt ready to be a man or a woman, those felt and still feel so utterly alien and awkward for me to try to be. Turned out it‚Äôs not the age that‚Äôs the issue it‚Äôs the expectations of what a woman or a man can and can‚Äôt do, look like, be.

Whatever brings you to feeling like this, to relating, however closely or loosely, if you feel like the binary isn‚Äôt you, or isn‚Äôt all you are, if you feel like manhood is just not something that can help define you, that‚Äôs all that you need to step just a bit away from it all and determine, what does it really all mean to you?

No one person is to blame, no one of us is able to make the whole change to our own cultures, but we‚Äôre all a little bit part of this system. That‚Äôs what intersectional feminism is about. Working your way against a bit more of this hierarchal system every day. Being nonbinary though has nothing to do with that, people are nonbinary whether they care to dismantle gender roles or see a strong value in them and wish for them to be upheld. Nonbinary isn‚Äôt political. There are some nonbinary identities like genderqueer or gender void and some philosophies/ideals like gender abolitionism that are adjacent. But yeah, anyone could be nonbinary whatever their actual opinions on the role of gender. Our thoughts about politics and culture don‚Äôt actually dictate our gender!

At work, your primary responsibility is to yourself and your safety. If that‚Äôs not much of a concern for you, then you spend some time learning about what other nonbinary people think and feel and suggest at work, and you do a bit of reflection, and you see how you can be that bit of improvement in your circles, your office. Certainly some folks use things like email signatures and pronoun pins, but others like me are either closeted or just don‚Äôt advertise like that? Or some are explicitly out in some circles and mildly closeted elsewhere. There‚Äôs a million ways to do this, the one that works for you and your life is the right one.
So here is one issue I foresee: I am a single ‚Äústraight male‚Äù per normal conventions. I don‚Äôt want to cause confusion for the universe, ya know? Like let‚Äôs say even if people are generally cool with it most likely they will be confused and not ask me. See what I mean? Is that a problem we are facing as an emerging sort of community?

Like bring on the compliments from homosexual men which will be kindly accepted and advances turned down, but‚Ä¶actually I‚Äôm an idiot I need to suck it up and ask girls out. But you see what I mean ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Appreciated. Yeah I‚Äôm truly in awe of how conflicted I am. I am kind of obsessive - that‚Äôs I lie, I can be an obsession monster - and I think I am going to end up being pretty active.

Idk what else to do and you are right my main questions right now are how do I start ‚Äòcoming out‚Äô and I‚Äôm probably more ready to push boundaries in my ‚Äòsterile‚Äô work environment than tell my friends and family.

Could you tell me, when I write pronouns in my signature, what I am really saying aside from ‚Äúi am non-binary‚Äù?

Essentially I am suggesting that they should not refer to me as ‚Äòhim‚Äô when I‚Äôm not around I guess right? Like it‚Äôs a ‚Äòhey i‚Äôm non-binary‚Äô first and foremost and i guess it just serves to ask them to be aware and considerate of that. 

Is it weird I keep getting flashes of not wanting to let go of being a man? Like I feel like I‚Äôm gaining myself but also losing something I cherish. I think the endgame is to hold onto both but‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs like i‚Äôm totally non-binary, but I‚Äôm still *something*

I wonder if this is part of it - I want to be seen, or ‚Äòknown‚Äô and to be seen or known requires a word for other people to use to understand you. For gender to be binary hah! What a strange concept when this clicks. 

I assume this will take time to process lolol, thank you for the warm welcome, I will have fun with this in the end.
I‚Äôm not straight, so I‚Äôm not quite in the same situation as you are, but I have felt the pain of not being naturally assertive and/or competitive when it comes to dating girls. I‚Äôve experienced the straight dating scene as toxic! But you don‚Äôt have to date the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù girl, right? You just need to find one that matches with you. Find a way to express who you are, and someone who accepts you will respond. It may just not be the average person.

Edit: wording
I realized a while ago that I have been feeling dysphoric when forced to wear traditionally masculine clothing in formal situations, like suits etc., and when someone calls me a ‚Äúman‚Äù. Instinctively, I have been dressing quite boy-like almost my whole adult life, essentially just T-shirts, sometimes playful or colorful ones, maybe because I‚Äôve felt that is the only way for me to express my soft approach to masculinity. There is a connection to what you said ‚Äì as boys we were still ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to be soft. But maybe that approach was too timid. I feel people didn‚Äôt understand what I was trying to express, because it was still too normative. So they weren‚Äôt forced to question their assumptions with me, which made me feel invisible and misunderstood. It also has become a problem in the sense that I‚Äôm not being taken seriously in a professional context, because I reject any sort of formal wear. So this is why I‚Äôve recently started to experiment with forms of expression that are less normative. I‚Äôve just started playing with nail polish, and combining that with what I usually wear. I could even imagine combining that with more formal wear (maybe a slim tailored suit, etc), so as to look professional and not too masculine at the same time. What I‚Äôm trying to say is, you can change how people perceive you, and that is by expressing your gender with cues that step outside of the normative! This makes people stop and reconsider their assumptions about you. So even if you personally don‚Äôt have the desire to change your expression, you can make it a conscious choice in order for others to see you the way you want them to see you.
Work rather than friends and family can totally make sense, it‚Äôs easier to be ‚Äútransgressive‚Äù in an environment where it feels like there are lower stakes, or the relationships are less personal. For me, work feels like high stakes while my immediate household already has known this about me for a decade, and I‚Äôm too financially unstable not to be afraid of consequences. Friends can be tricky because we gain them from all kinds of sources and it‚Äôs hard to control information flow - but having queer and trans friends has been a necessary support system for me. Highly recommend starting to find whatever counts as local community. It can be rocky especially if you‚Äôre dealing with the whole invisibility thing on either/both a gender or orientation front, but you DO belong in spaces for us and for questioning folk. If a group isn‚Äôt welcoming, that is their problem and not something intrinsic to you.

When you put pronouns other than what people have been expecting you to use in your email signature, you are signaling ‚Äúhey, there‚Äôs something here‚Äù. You aren‚Äôt telling people *what* that thing is there, but it‚Äôs a big flag for it. Practically speaking, people who know that nonbinary people exist are likely to assume that it has something to do with that, but there are a lot of people, especially the kind of people more likely to be high up in a corporate or office structure, who will have no idea what‚Äôs going on and either subconsciously ignore it or be confused as hell. Pronouns aren‚Äôt gender, or, they don‚Äôt have to be, they don‚Äôt have to line up. So people will still likely want an explanation. But yes, what you‚Äôre saying is you want for people to use those words to refer to you instead of what they‚Äôve been using (or in the case of people doing it with pronouns people already use for them, signaling that they think we should be a culture that is more open to showing these things rather than having to guess or assume). Whether you‚Äôre there or not, because there is quite a bit of pronoun usage in spaces like meetings and parties and any kind of group conversation even when you‚Äôre there unless someone has trained themselves to avoid pronouns.

It‚Äôs fine to be connected to what you‚Äôve assumed you were, there‚Äôs nothing at all wrong with that. I‚Äôm not a shining example of it, but look at all kinds of nonbinary folks whose nonbinary-ness is because they have a connection to man or woman AND something else. Whether it‚Äôs what you were assigned at birth or not, it‚Äôs ok to feel it‚Äôs a part of you or informs your understanding of the world, whatever level of connection there is. I like to think like this: if someone who was assigned the other binary gender at birth can do it and be seen as nonbinary then I can too, because otherwise we‚Äôre enforcing a secondary binary on ourselves, arbitrary restrictions that don‚Äôt actually free us to be who we really are.

Enjoy it as much as you can. This can be an absolutely beautiful thing. The stresses and anxieties, these are unnecessary, only existing because we‚Äôve culturally erased nonbinary existence. As much as you can be confident in your self and your needs, that will help you.
Yes yes yes! Haha totally agree. I recently started wearing necklaces and bracelets, got a few rings and I kinda want a girl who will mess around with eyeshadow and nail polish while we are in private. There‚Äôs gotta be some who would have fun with that just gotta find the right circles :)
üëè Bravo. I‚Äôm absolutely feeling liberated. This was wayyy deep down in there (I‚Äôm 37) and I just accepted being different in the past without pinpointing it. Weird that identifying what the difference is, is directly related to language and really nothing much else about actual humanity."	pkmfx2	NonBinary	15	1.0	2021-09-09 00:06:32

How do I explain what it means to be a nonbinary lesbian?	"Hi, this is my first reddit post so bare with me please. Later on in this post I am going to be talking about a bad experience I had in response to coming out as a nonbinary lesbian, which may be distressing.

I‚Äôve identified as a cisgender lesbian for the past few years. I‚Äôve always felt very solid in being a lesbian, but this past year I‚Äôve had some realizations about my gender identity. While I‚Äôm still figuring a lot out, I came to the conclusion that I identify as a nonbinary lesbian. I do still feel aligned with womanhood to a certain extent, and while I questioned this for a long time, doing some reading about women-aligned nonbinary folks gave me a lot of clarity. I was happy to find a label that I felt described me well. I told a few trans friends of mine who live in different cities and they also provided me with a lot of guidance in figuring things out. 

From there I thought the next step would be to tell my girlfriend. We‚Äôve been dating for a little under a year and she means the world to me. I‚Äôve always been careful in assessing the quality of our relationship and it has always felt very healthy. She is cisgender and generally describes herself as either bisexual or queer, though she identified as a lesbian for a long time. She is generally very aware about social issues so I did not think coming out to her would be a problem. Today I told her that I think I‚Äôm nonbinary. I think she was surprised at first, but she said okay and told me that she supports me. I then told her that I‚Äôm still figuring everything out and that I still feel like a lesbian. At this point she had some reservations. 

She is of the mindset that you can either be nonbinary or a woman and that there is no overlap between them, so it doesn‚Äôt make sense to claim to be a nonbinary lesbian. She was ‚Äúirked‚Äù (her word) at the idea of nonbinary people ‚Äúappropriating‚Äù (also her word) lesbianism because to her, it‚Äôs something inherently tied to binary womanhood. She said that she felt like claiming to be a nonbinary lesbian was like getting something that was a benefit of womanhood (ie the joys of being a wlw) without having the responsibility of womanhood (ie protecting other women). I tried explaining a lot of different things, including that  I would never stop protecting women, that nonbinary isn‚Äôt just a third gender, and that I still experience oppression under misogyny. Her response to the last one was that because I‚Äôm nonbinary, it‚Äôs oppression in a different way, and thus doesn‚Äôt mean that I should be able to claim womanhood if I don‚Äôt fully align with it. I think it‚Äôs important to note that she could not provide a clear definition of womanhood. She said the whole thing was a matter of community. She was respectful and never blatantly demeaning, but the whole thing was very distressing to say the least. I‚Äôm not out to anyone else in my town, so I‚Äôm kind of desperate for support here. 

The problem isn‚Äôt inherently in me being nonbinary, but rather in me being a nonbinary lesbian. She agreed to read more on the topic, so I scoured online for a while and sent her a few links. She is not a close minded person, just a little stubborn, so I‚Äôm not feeling hopeless about the whole situation. I just don‚Äôt think I have a good way to describe my gender identity to make it make sense to her, which brings me to why I‚Äôm here. I want to explain in a way that addresses her idea of binary women and nonbinary people as completely separate, which brings me to the point of this whole post:

How do I explain what it means to be a nonbinary lesbian? I just want her to understand



TLDR: I need to figure out how to explain what it means to be a nonbinary lesbian to someone who is accepting of nonbinary people, but thinks that they are completely disconnected from binary genders (most of the issues are in the fourth paragraph)"	"wish i had helpful advice to lend, but i also struggle with explaining it to people who don‚Äôt already ‚Äúget it‚Äù. i hope you can find a way to explain it that works. also: maybe try crossposting on r/nonbinarylesbians too if you havent already. good luck
Similar but opposite hat, as someone who recently came to enby-hood from the other side. There are tons of nonbinary lesbians out there: those who use ""lesbian"" as a catch-all word because they're still seen as women dating women, those who are nonbinary but still connected to womanhood, those who aren't connected to womanhood but like women specifically and don't really have a community, and those who use it for a lot more reasons. 

Gender and sexuality are a weird intersection, and sometimes when they don't overlap, you use both words to describe what you're feeling. Hope this goes well!

Thoughts on masks	"  You always hear a lot of people complaining about wearing masks but personally,  i'm not only pretty introverted but also enby and i love wearing my mask.

  I'm making this post mainly because just a bit earlier i saw myself in the mirror while i was wearing a mask and i almost cried (tears of joy, don't worry)  from how androgynous i looked in it.   It was a really nice thing to experience and i was wondering if anyone else had a similar experience with wearing a mask."	"Personally, I find my eyes very feminine looking, so a mask just accentuates them, giving me the opposite affect of what I'd like. If I had a binder, perhaps the rest of my outfit could help counter that but I won't have one for a while.

I'm glad the masks help you though! I was certain they'd help a lot of us with at least a bit of euphoria so that's nice to hear üòä
yes! the lower part of my face is literally what gives me the most dysphoria
I like the way I look in the masks, especially my rainbow pride HRC one.
I dislike wearing a mask because I feel like when people can't see my facial hair, they assume I'm a woman since I'm 5'3 =(  Of course, I still do wear the mask.  I just hate it haha
I‚Äôve worn masks way before the pandemic because they look cool af and def help give a more androgynous look! Now I get to glare at people who ARENT wearing one when pre-pandemic wearing a mask would get you glares haha
I hope you can get your binder soon enough  :3
For me it's my facial hair,  but i don't have a trimmer i can use and don't know how to shave / don't feel comfortable shaving yet
Yes!  *How the turn tables*
Sounds like I'm getting one for Christmas! üíú

I made a silly fun gender questionnaire	"It's not really a quiz but it asks some abstract questions about your gender and I think it should be entertaining to fill out.

woahhh this was so much fun. thank you :)
Responses submitted. For real, though, go check out Manduk Mandir.
Super fun!
That was super cool! I enjoyed it!
That was a fun lil questionnaire. Made me think about myself a bit which was nice
That was a really good quiz! I'm really curious about results, though: will you post them anywhere?

Just looked it up, so cool!! Frogs are delightful creatures
I'm hoping to post them on here sometime soon!
And thank you for filling it out :D
Just out of curiosity, can you guess my gender identification from my survey responses? I tried to pepper in some actual clues in my answers that might (?) help.
Demiboy perhaps (based on the colors)? Or gender-fluid?

I did some hard things this week.	"A week ago today I came out to a good friend of mine. I even got to tell him my name and pronouns, which he‚Äôs called me by ever since. 

After wearing compression tops for a while, I also bought my first binder today. 

I live in a state where we are fighting every day to protect trans rights. So it feels good today to just take a moment to be grateful for friendship and growth and community and trans joy."	"Congratulations. Trans joy is an act of resistance.

I (afab nb, 27) don‚Äôt want to come out as NB unless I decide to get top surgery. I would really appreciate any advice as I‚Äôm trying to sort through my feelings.	"It‚Äôs not because I don‚Äôt think trans identities are valid without surgery. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm afraid of people I know and people I don‚Äôt know treating me differently/negatively. Ever since puberty I have hated having breasts and being forced by society to act ‚Äúgirly‚Äù. As an adolescent, I wished I had a gender neutral name, was reluctant to shave my legs, and was always ‚Äúbinding‚Äù without realizing it (i.e. always wearing sports bras). When I finally moved to a much more liberal area after college, I started to realize this pattern and realized I‚Äôm non-binary. I bought a binder about a year ago and I love being able to feel a bit more comfortable in my clothes. I have told one friend and a therapist about all this and have their support. 

All this to say: I know that I‚Äôm non-binary and want to get top surgery, but I am terrified of the negative societal repercussions. I wish it could just happen overnight and no one would notice any difference except me. But it will be noticeable, by my coworkers, by my friends and family, and probably by some bigoted strangers. My family tends to be more conservative, and my job is in a relatively conservative field although my coworkers themselves are more liberal-leaning. I follow several nb accounts on a ‚Äúfake‚Äù instagram (so my friends and family don‚Äôt see what I‚Äôm following). It brings me so much joy to see other nb people living their lives and loving their body after top surgery, but seeing the horrible negative comments crushes me inside. I don‚Äôt want to experience anything like that in my real life. I do want come out, but don‚Äôt feel that it will be ‚Äúworth it‚Äù to deal with the negative repercussions if I don‚Äôt have the positive effects of having top surgery to go along with it. I feel like I have to choose between internal pain versus external judgement."	"I think if people are going to treat you differently or negatively for being nonbinary, they are going to do it regardless of if you get top surgery or not.
My heart is somewhat warmed that you got through 27 years of life without having that kind of vitriol directed at you. 

For online harassment, practice your iron tongue. They are essentially not real. If a named person on Facebook or something is threatening you, you can file a police report and at least log the messages as evidence. If it's anonymous, it means nothing, just coward talk. 

For in-person harassment, the types that are unhinged enough to target people in public tend to have really bad queer-dar and would harass anyone that stands out. It seems like a ""car wrecks are bad so I shouldn't drive"" mindset, as we often need a car just as we have a need to exist honestly. 

All that being said, if you have a genuine safety concern then you probably know best how to handle yourself, you seem like you have a good head on your shoulders. 

I believe in you!
I get this. I'm in a very liberal area so people didn't/don't exactly judge me, but they didn't generally take it particularly seriously prior to top surgery either. It was just like being some flavor of GNC, only the way I didn't ""conform"" was that I objected to being called a woman. (Me: ü§î/üòÇ/üò≠, depending on the day) I had surgery a month ago so it's still too early to say what differences I'll encounter, but I could see there being a greater deal of respect and acknowledgement than when they'd glance down and think they ""knew"" something about me because of the shape of my chest. I've seen as much between how people treat my more visibly trans non-binary coworker and I: nobody's *surprised* my coworker uses they/them, whereas with me they're only ever surprised that when I said I wasn't cis, I didn't mean I was a binary trans woman.

As you've begun exploring though, coming out isn't really an all-or-nothing thing. And a *lot* of bigoted people would ignore it even if you said it to their face. Or perpetually expect that you've ""gotten over it."" Even traveling to very conservative areas, nobody has ever been as outright mean as Internet comments can be. I think misogyny actually has worked in my favor, sort of, in that since they see me as a woman they feel they shouldn't be as hostile as they might if they saw me as, say, a gay man. Again, it still remains to be seen how having had top surgery changes that, but I'm thinking ""flat-chested"" will probably just be added to the list in ways I am unfortunately ""ugly"" to them, much like my body hair and clothing choices and lack of makeup.

On that front, I haven't actually told my family of origin about top surgery. I'm thinking I'll characterize it as a reduction if I have to say anything. They're not going to be happy for me anyway, so why should I let them tarnish my truth with their opinions? They might as well vent all that against something only halfway accurate that I don't really care how anyone feels about since it's not real.
I can't comment on friends and family, but I can tell you that no one at work said anything when I got top surgery. I told them I needed time off for a medical procedure, went on leave, then came back with no tits. All they did was try not to let me push myself too hard while I was still recovering. I caught my boss looking at my chest when I first got back (lol) but pretended not to notice and that was that.

If you don't talk about it, they may assume it's a sensitive topic and avoid even asking. I don't know what the culture of your workplace is like, though.
I feel this. You can always do a soft comimg out with your friends first/chosen family. Doesn‚Äôt have to be all or nothing. Ask them to call you by a chosen name and use your preferred pronouns. See how it goes then decide if it is worth it in your current situation. Who knows some of your friends may also fear what might happen if they come out?
Exactly, that‚Äôs why I am afraid to come out regardless of whether or not I get top surgery. But if I did get top surgery I would essentially be ‚Äúforced‚Äù to come out since the change would be noticeable. I don‚Äôt see any reason to subject myself to peoples‚Äô negative opinions unless I also get the personal joy from having my body match the way I feel inside. Sorry if I didn‚Äôt make that clear:/
That is true, people are a lot more inclined to be really openly bigoted online than in person. Thanks:)
Congrats on your top surgery! And thank you for sharing your experiences, it was comforting to read and made me feel less alone with these feelingsüòä
My coworkers are all really close knit and caring, I would honestly feel kinda weird not telling them the reason for my absence. They would be truly concerned for me if I mysteriously disappeared for medical reasons. The logical assumption would be either top surgery or breast cancer, which I would feel very guilty misleading them about (even unintentionally)
Oh I see. That makes sense.
Fair enough. I made sure to tell them that I wasn't dying and that the procedure was low risk, but they probably did assume it was cancer-related. I don't feel like my medical info is any of their business, so whatever assumptions they make is on them IMO. If asked, my plan was to just say they were more trouble than they were worth, maybe mention back pain. That never happened, though. I was glad they were able to express concern and help me out a bit with my physical restrictions while still respecting my privacy.

If I lived in a more progressive state, I might have done things a little differently. It just didn't feel worth trying to navigate coming out.
Yeah that makes sense:) I think part of my stress is not knowing how some people would react. Thank you for sharing!"	108d4ku	NonBinary	12	1.0	2023-01-10 15:53:16
How to describe being nonbinary	"I had a revelation today thinking about a conversation I had a few days ago with a friend about what it feels like to be nonbinary.

Gender identity is sort of like a streaming service. 

There's like all of these possibilities.

Sometimes you turn a show on and like super vibe with it and binge the whole thing but then it's over. So you just watch it again. And again.

Or maybe you just watch a show once through, and that's it. That's what you needed for that time.

And then there are shows you watch an episode or like a few minutes of, and it's just not for you. And that's okay.

And sometimes you just can't help but go back to the shows that you always watch and bring you the most joy and comfort.

And sometimes there are days where you just can't decide what to watch. So you dont watch anything. But that's okay.

Sometimes you just dont feel like watching a specific show. And sometimes there's a rotation of shows. And sometimes you're on your phone looking at YouTube while your favorite show is on in the background. 

Cisgender people have been content watching the same show their whole lives. Not a bad thing at all  that's just their thing.

And then dysphoria is like being forced to watch a show you don't particularly want to. And transphobia is basically just being forced to watch FOX news, which isn't really that much of a metaphor tbf.

Anyway. Thought I'd share my metaphor with you guys. And please share any metaphors you have/like to use! I'd love to hear."	"Here's one for social experiences:

Imagine if people believed you could only have dark or light hair. There's a couple different ways it could look, but by and large everyone is one or the other. 


If you're a redhead, people might look at you and assume your hair is dyed, or just generally be uncomfortable seeing you, or try and lump you into one of the two existing categories. You'd probably be frustrated, and rightly so. So what can you do about it? Maybe you dye it brown and pretend it's your natural color just to blend in, but then you're denying part of yourself. Maybe you start an awareness movement, but then everyone tells you to ""stop making it your whole personality."" Maybe you shave it off altogether, but then you'll be constantly asked what color it would be if it was there.

Or let's say you do have brown or blond hair, but decide to dye it. You'll probably have much the same experience, with the added factor of people being obsessed with your natural color and completely ignoring what color it actually is. They might get angry if you change it to yet another color. The list goes on.

To tie this all together: intersex people are as common as redheads. Non-binary people even more so, likely by a dramatic amount. The hypothetical society I just described *already exists*, and we all live in it.
>And transphobia is basically just being forced to watch FOX news, which isn't really that much of a metaphor tbf.

Can't stop giggling at this.

&#x200B;

>And then dysphoria is like being forced to watch a show you don't particularly want to.

I hate horror movies, particularly body horror, so this is barely a metaphor too.
Ooh. I like that a lot."	u32wt3	NonBinary	11	0.93	2022-04-13 23:01:08
Took two difficult phone calls to the bank (HSBC), but finally got them to change my form of address from Mr to Mx!	"Just to be clear, on the HSBC website it states:

>If you don't want a gender-specific title on your account, we can change it to either 'Mx' or 'M'.  
>  
>For gender-neutral title changes, where you're not¬†changing your name, we don't need any proof for the change to be made. Just call us...

The first time I rang the bank, the support person was like 'Errrr... what? Please repeat.' So I repeated, and she went 'You want to change your name?' No, I want to change my title. And it went back and forth until she finally got it, and then put me hold to 'pull up my details' which I took to mean, ask her colleagues what the fuck to do. Anyway, she comes back on and says she can't do it. She can only change me to Mrs, wtf - and then says but if I go into the bank with a photo ID with 'Mx' on it, maybe they can change it there.

Second time, again 'Errrr... you want to do... what?' and so on, and the guy forced me to tell him where on the HSBC website it says I can change it for some reason, and then he looks it up I guess, and puts me on hold, and the comes back and says 'OK, I will change that.' Joy! But if they have the option to change it in the system, why are they making me dance like this??

Anyway, I got an electronic statement and it said 'Mx' on the account name, but the letter was still addressed to 'Mr' FFS. Still some work to do there. 

Wasn't sure whether to tag this post as a rant or a yay, but I need a win today!"	"I'd suggest to use the word ""honorific"", but you probably would have just confused them even more.  :)
Bruh what. How‚Äôd they got confused at what you want, and have trouble with it?!üòë

me and my boyfriend have come up with a few good gender neutral terms and i thought i'd share	"mostly starting cause someone told me about ""joyfriend"" as a neutral term thats a little less formal than ""partner"" or similar (not that people who use partner arent based as hecc), and we've come up with a few more, mostly using ""joy"" in place of boy or girl, like ""femjoy"", or just using it in conversation like calling me a ""cute joyo"", just figured id share cause they make me feel nice so maybe it'll make some people here feel nice <3"		n3l1n6	NonBinary	12	1.0	2021-05-03 01:40:35
Euphorically weeping in a skirt	"Yesterday my wife and I (41,nb,amab) had a big ol' fight. The specifics of that aren't really important here. It wasn't about gender, so yay for that ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 

Also yesterday, I wore a skirt. That's still pretty new for me, so I guess this was the first time I've really sobbed while wearing a skirt. In the midst of it all, I felt a surprising sort of gender affirmation? And now I'm trying to pick apart exactly what that meant. It felt better and easier to experience those emotions while presenting my gender more honestly. That sentence seems really straightforward but took me 15 minutes to write.

It made me think of all the fiction I've consumed in which women in flowing skirts weep romantically. I should probably look around for more fiction about nonbinary folk :)

Unfortunately, my rush of euphoria was followed by some guilt and disgust -- the bits of myself that fear I look foolish or am somehow deluding myself and others. For these self-critical voices, there was something deeply shameful about finding a joy or solace in my gender expression while also dealing with the pain of the argument with my wife.

Anyway, I've changed the flair on this post a million times as I waffle about what I'm really looking for here, why I'm making this post. It was a complicated bit of emotion and y'all seemed like a sympathetic ear. Does any of this make sense outside of my head?"	"Embracing your identity and freeing yourself from AMAB expectations (perhaps to not cry, show emotion) makes sense and if externalising that through crying and wearing a skirt has been a freeing and emotional experience for you, then I can totally understand! And that's not to say that anyone of any gender needs to feel bad about crying nor do they need to wear a skirt to do so, but given the pressures that do exist and how freeing it can be to embrace one's identity, I can appreciate why that all aligned to feel like a euphoric moment for you, even if it was tempered with other emotions about the argument.
Thank you, kind person <3"	pxtq8z	NonBinary	12	0.94	2021-09-29 11:50:41
Just a little happiness for you!	"So I decided to come out to select family members at the beginning of pride month. My mother reacted badly, but eventually came around to it (even though she's resistant to they/them pronouns :| ) but the two cousins who I'm closest with were wonderful. Both of them said ""this doesn't change that I love you, I support you, and I'm proud of you for coming out!"" (That's paraphrased, but was the general message). I just saw one of them last week, and she used the right pronouns for me, and the right name for me. I almost cried. So I just wanted to share this with everyone and bring a little joy to everyone's day!"	What a huge step, congrats! I'm glad your mom is coming around, hopefully she starts using your pronouns too.	c11kam	NonBinary	12	1.0	2019-06-15 20:11:08
My partner just came out to me as gender fluid	"Basically what the title says. My partner came out to me the other day as pansexual and gender fluid. (He told me he is still okay with masculine pronouns, in case anyone is wondering).\\

I'm torn between my values and my trauma. To elaborate, I identify as queer and cisgender (female). My whole life has been dedicated to my values. I am a strong believer in the existence of more than two genders, and the social construction of gender. But, I am having a very hard time with my partner coming out.   


I am a survivor of severe, prolonged childhood abuse, which has left me with pretty severe complex PTSD. I have a VERY hard time with any change or any feelings of loss. My partner coming out just triggered so much of this in me. To clarify, I absolutely do not care what he wears, nor do I even have any interest in dating someone who is hyper-masculine. So, why am I feeling the way I am feeling?  


Consciously, I know that my partner is not a different person. He is the same person I have loved for the past seven years. But subconsciously, him coming out fills me with a sense of complete and utter panic - like I am losing him. He has told me that he does not want to make any permanent changes to his body, but I still worry that he will change his mind later. I think this worry comes a bit from my history of being sexually abused as a child. It takes A LOT for me to trust someone sexually - I have memorized his body because I need that familiarity in order to feel safe.   


I recognize that this is a big jumble, and I am not even sure what I am asking here. Maybe help with getting over these feelings? Maybe someone could help me put it in perspective? I have spoken to my partner about this but I don't want to make this all about me. This should be a moment of joy for him - to finally come out and be who he was meant to be. But I am being eaten by my fears and guilt. I feel so guilty for having any of these thoughts. I feel like the biggest hypocrite ever. How can I dedicate my life to equality but be like this?"	"I mean recognizing that feelings of change give you anxiety is a start. It is also important to acknowledge the fact that change is inevitable, and when it comes, it will flip your life upside down. 

You need to adjust, and also talk to your partner about the adjustment. Coming out means people also need time to understand what that means for them, and that does not mean rejection. You can be happy for them and want clarity on what this means on your relationship moving forward.

Be open in communicating your fears or doubts with your partner! Also, go to therapy if you aren't already to discuss your anxiety and work through it. Your partner deserves the support, but you also do not need to compromise your mental health in the process. 

Also, researching the subject, talking to people is a good start. The more you talk about it, the more you can unpack. 

Overall I send you and your partner best wishes. It is a process to know yourself, and also knowing someone else.
give it some time. I'm sure you will notice that not as much changes as you fear now. he's still the same person, he still loves you, that did not change at all. take some time to see how things are going, hang in there, I am sure it will all be well! talk about your struggles, both of you, try to understand beach other. I'm sure you will be alright! you got this:)
Are you seeing a therapist? If you aren‚Äôt, that‚Äôs absolutely the first thing you should do if you are able. What you went through as a child and your anxiety and PTSD are a part of you, but people are treated and sometimes even medicated for those conditions. A counselor or psychotherapist would be a great first step towards decoupling the feelings you have about your partner and his gender identity with feelings of anxiety and trauma. 

At the end of the day, no matter what the cause of your reaction is, it isn‚Äôt healthy for either of you and it isn‚Äôt fair to him, which you seem to have identified. This is in no way a personal failing, but it is an opportunity for growth. Rather than burden your partner with the majority of these feelings, I think it would be best to seek professional help and try to treat yourself as kindly as possible while understanding that you can‚Äôt necessarily control what you feel right now. 

It is also indeed possible that your partner transitions medically, alters their social presentation further, or does any number of things. Change is a commonality in all relationship. Transition is just one kind of change that some relationships undergo. If you two end up being incompatible due to change, that‚Äôs not a personal failing either - it just happens. It‚Äôs sad and it can hurt, but it happens! Just like with other forms of change. 

Try your best to take a breath! I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way. You will figure it out with time. Again, I think therapy is your best course of action. Hang in there!
CPTSD is incredibly difficult to live with. I also have CPTSD and am learning to cope and handle my emotions better. Not everyone has that ability as it depends on the kind of trauma people were exposed to.

I can tell you are very logical, and I know that logic in the face of CPTSD is not always enough, it also takes time, effort, care and gentleness to get out of the peril. You can't help how you feel or react to new situations/changes to your routine. You will need time to regulate and adjust to this and I'm sure your partner will understand that if you decide to communicate that to them. New things are frightening to everyone, but to someone with CPTSD it triggers the fear response, so you're valid in the ways you are feeling about this situation. Remind yourself that it's ok to take time to adjust and that there's a reason you put your love and fragile trust into this person.

If you can or have coping mechanisms, it would be a good time to reduce your anxiety/panic with them first, then try to regulate your emotional state as you and your partner continue to live your lives and experience new growths and changes. It's difficult, but I know you got this since you've survived this long :)"	ntrpd8	NonBinary	13	1.0	2021-06-06 18:08:25
EEEEEEE Top Surgery Decision!!	"It has been a tough process but I stuck it out and finally got approval for my slightly unusual nonbinary top surgery - I'm freeing the nips (no nipples) and not going to be perfectly flat BUT in a more even masculinizing way rather than a small breast. It was tough to describe what I wanted and I felt so scared that I was just wrong so many times, but now I'm finally just waiting on my insurance to get back to me and I'm SO EXCITED and proud of myself for sticking to what I want!!

Just found this sub	"I‚Äôve been questioning my gender for ages and used to think I might be trans- but realised I don‚Äôt fit into that gender either. I‚Äôve thought about being NB from time to time and sometimes put they/them pronouns, but always thought ‚Äòwell I also identify with my AGAD which is female, so I‚Äôm not really NB then???‚Äô 

Two days ago I Googled info on NB people and I just- I cried. So, so, so, SO much. My loving partner even tapped my shoulder and asked what‚Äôs wrong, and I knew right then and there that yes, I do identify as female, but also not as female. I feel like both. Holy moly the amount of joy I felt, and the love , and acceptance???

My partner does identify as straight and I was terrified to tell, but he said ‚ÄòI love YOU. I am attracted to female presenting, but I am in love with you. I‚Äôve seen you dress shapeless, masculine, feminine, and no matter what you wear or what you identify as, you are who I love. Thank you for being honest with me.‚Äô 

Idk I am rambling but the amount of joy and love and acceptance I am receiving makes me both cry and feel so happy!!!!"	It‚Äôs good that you have someone so supportive close to you!

Some of my (recent) story. This is painful. And thank you.	"TL;DR telling part of my (recent) story, cracking and breaking down, how painful this is, but still, ultimately, thanks for being here.
-- 
Gender confusion started a long time ago, but the questions seemed innocent and angsty and so confused and nebulous, and they got locked up and pushed aside and repressed and went unanswered.  And then visiting /r/bi_irl turned into visiting /r/egg_irl and then I got hit by the gender identity confusion freight train.

I was already under considerable mental and emotional pressure from events and things happening around me over which I feel little control: work, home, relationship, family, parenthood, you name it.  I knew I was dangerously close to ‚Äòcracking up‚Äô psychologically.

I didn‚Äôt know even know that this egg was there, let alone that it was going to crack regardless of the inconvenience, repercussions or practicality of the matter.  But it did start to crack and I found inside of it the idea that I am non-binary.  Inside, I am not a one-gendered being.  The maleness I‚Äôve never been completely comfortable with could take a step back and leave room for what was once called my ‚Äúfeminine side‚Äù to exist.

In short, I could just be a person and not live in a prison defined by internalized gender roles and identities.  The ones that I let in and let take over because I had to just get things done and live my life.  And perhaps most importantly, (let go of) the identities and roles I felt I needed to have in order to have relationships with my family members and in order to form relationships with the people around me.

I posted a photo here just 13 days ago ‚Ä¶ after having the courage to put on a woman‚Äôs top for the first time and realizing that I wanted to feel pretty and that it wasn‚Äôt just confusion going on inside and a process that I needed to do inside myself in order to ‚Äúresolve‚Äù the confusion and crisis of unearthing my non-binary nature.

Y‚Äôall have been super supportive and made me feel validated, praised me for being out there and recognized the confidence that I have had that this is not just some ‚Äúthing‚Äù going on but something embedded in my core.  You could see me and being seen, I could cry, am tearing up in fact already, that strangers on the internet did that.  They could see me.

I don‚Äôt want to be a stranger to you or to myself.  I want the strength of not being some stranger to be avoided and ignored by myself, by everyone, remaining unseen.

But confidence does not come without questioning, and bravery does not come without fear.  And the joy of discovery and setting out to new continents, uncharted ‚Ä¶ it does not hide or take away the sadness I hold inside, that you can see on most days behind my eyes.

Just 13 days after feeling so pretty and making that first post, and now it‚Äôs feeling too painful.  What I am asking my family to endure, the future unfolding that doesn‚Äôt feel like I can control anymore than I can control what came before ‚Ä¶

I went to a trans/gender identity support group last night for the first time.  My SO came along.  Near the end, a woman talked to me about the selfish nature of what is happening with me right now.  I know the situation from my struggles with mental illness, how selfish those diseases are and how damaging to relationships.

My SO has been supportive, although I know that she doesn‚Äôt really understand.  It turns out that it was selfish of me to have her come along to the group.  She was too tired to spend several hours there and to hear from me ‚Äúhormones are not out of the question‚Äù and whatever other things that I said that are scary to her, whatever things she heard from the trans women there that scared her ‚Ä¶ the fear that she is carrying that I‚Äôm not actually NB but am trans and just in the process of coming to terms with it.

I told her last night that I should ‚Äújust lock this back up‚Äù and she knew, it feels like she always knows even when it hurts so bad ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúyou have to figure this out now, because you can‚Äôt lock this up for another 5 years or whatever.  I need to know before I marry you and we buy a house and ...""

I want to tell my story but I want to know for myself what that story is more than anything.  And I wish it wasn't feeling so painful.

Thank you for reading this and for your support.

I'm happy to read other people's stories no matter the confusion or incompleteness or ?"	"This was a lot to take in, but I understand the confusion as I've only just begun my realization of being non-binary. Selfish or not, take the time you need to figure things out and I know I'll support it. I'm just glad I'm not the only one going through this
Thank you for the support and taking the time to read the post.

It's funny to me ... Although understandable, so little talk here about just how difficult ""this"" is in a big picture kind of way.

This they, this them.  This any and all pronouns.  This transition and to what?  To whom?

I'm afraid if not sure that figuring things out means doing a lot of selfish things, not just taking time.

Even taking time, what is life if not time?  So short a time left to be me or to be the person I need to be so that I'm not being so selfish.

1/10 of my life this far and more to wait until my daughter is out of high school to be out of the closet.  Even then a choice between out at work and out of work, it would seem.  To be out that 40 hours of the week ... Basically 1/3 of my life.

So even less time spent in a state of peace and clarity, then?

I could go on with my consciousness streaming, as it were.  But I will post this reply now and wait for something other than madness and meaninglessness to come forth from inside.
Although I don't share every struggle with you, I think I understand your lack of time to yourself. I have had my share of tough times, living in a camper for 6 years in a family of 5. I am definitely not the best at making people feel better, as I often don't understand my own emotions, but I can say that keeping an optimistic outlook on life will definitely help your struggles. Doing that was the only way I was able to get through those 6 years without severe depression, and that was adding onto my socially awkward state. I believe you can get through it as long as you believe in yourself. Like I said before, I'm terrible at socializing, so I understand if you took it differently than I intended.
I'm just struggling and it comes out as the kind of existential philosophical overemotional depressive word vomit that probably doesn't make a ton of sense even if it conveys something of my mental and emotional state.

I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through that tough experience, but happy to hear that you did get through it and were able to do so by keeping an optimistic outlook."	cfruv7	NonBinary	11	1.0	2019-07-20 22:35:53
AMAB and having difficulty comfortably expressing my non-binary identity	"So, I‚Äôm nearly 40 (in less than a month), and only recently understood and recognized myself as non-binary (or gender non-conforming; I‚Äôm unsure of the difference if any, and which best applies to me, but NB is what I‚Äôm working with for now), as well as queer/bisexual (which isn‚Äôt particularly relevant but included for completeness).

I have an overtly male physique. I do not have a willowy waif-like body that could read as either male or female, or indeterminate gender. I‚Äôm not severely overweight, but I carry what fat/chub I do have in the typical places an AMAB person will. My facial structure is unmistakably male, even when ignoring the facial hair. The point is, if you look at me for more than a second, you will see ‚Äúmale‚Äù.

I‚Äôve done a few things to present more androgynously, or at least highlight the feminine aspects of myself. I‚Äôve stopped masking my gestures, mannerisms, and vocal tones and inflections. I‚Äôm growing out my hair, and while it reads fairly masculine for now, it‚Äôs being styled in a way that will make for an easier transition to a feminine style as it gets longer. I paint my nails in pretty colors. I wear ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù colors as often as I can. I trim my facial hair daily (I could shave it completely, but I‚Äôd look terrible; besides, I don‚Äôt mind having a beard because I‚Äôm not trying to pass as a woman), and I shave my body hair as often as I can devote my time to it. I‚Äôm beginning to experiment with makeup, but I‚Äôm terrible at it. It‚Äôs a learning curve, and I‚Äôm 30 years behind in experience. I‚Äôm trying to be patient and compassionate with myself.

That said, I still feel like I present very very masculine. At most, I feel like I come across as a gay cis man, which while fine on its own does not feel true to me, a bisexual but sapphoromantic non-binary person.

I think part of the issue is clothes. Firstly, I‚Äôve spent nearly 40 years wearing men‚Äôs (or boy‚Äôs) clothes, and it‚Äôs the majority of what I own. I have a few pairs of women‚Äôs shoes (no heels yet because I don‚Äôt know how to walk in them), some pairs of women‚Äôs undergarments (just for the sense of affirmation and a private sense of joy), and a couple pieces of women‚Äôs outerwear (a jacket and a cardigan, both of which are only feminine because of color/textile pattern and small details).

Secondly, when browsing ‚Äúnon-binary clothes‚Äù online, what I typically find is shapeless clothing or clothing that just looks ‚Äúmale‚Äù. Maybe blame it on how society views male as the default and female as a descriptive trait, so anything neutral just defaults to male. Whatever the reason, it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve noticed. Maybe I‚Äôm looking in the wrong spot, or my googling techniques are woefully inadequate.

Thirdly, I‚Äôm not comfortable wearing clothes like skirts or dresses. I know it‚Äôs a valid way for many in the NB community to validate their sense of gender and identity, and I celebrate that for them, and I‚Äôm extremely happy for them. But for me, it‚Äôs not the path forward. I don‚Äôt feel feminine in dresses and skirts. If anything, it highlights my own masculinity because I become hyper aware of my masculinity. I feel like a man in a dress.

I want to feel both masculine and feminine, because that‚Äôs what I feel like inside. I don‚Äôt want to feel like a man in a woman costume.

Where can I find clothes that could help me express androgyny that aren‚Äôt shapeless gray sacks or ‚Äúmen‚Äôs clothing cut to fit a AFAB body‚Äù? What are some other things I can do to express femininity without going full tilt into costume or trying to pass as a woman? Are there haircuts for NB‚Äôs other than mullets, one-sided undercuts, and hideous shags and bowl cuts from the 70s (asked sarcastically but also kinda not)?

Along with answers to these questions, any advice you may have, or answers to questions I don‚Äôt even know yet to ask are very much welcome. This is all very new to me, and while I‚Äôm fortunate to have lots of acceptance and tolerance from friends and family, I don‚Äôt have much in the way of support or guidance"	"Disclaimer: I'm nb and in the ""gray sack"" phase because I'm on hrt and my body is changing. I'm AFAB which I know changes how I've been socialized and how I'm perceived.

I've given up at looking at ""nonbinary fashion"". The reality is that nonbinary such a big umbrella that it doesn't belong in a category.

Something that has helped me is looking at other nonbinary people and the way they present and noticing what I like and don't like. The more exposure I got, the less I started to associate nonbinary with waif-like or androgynous. Especially if you look at more than just white people, I mean look at as many people who have consented to share their expression.

Also, if you take a look at nonbinary people like Alok or Jonathan van Ness or watch the Getting Curious episode on nonbinary people they may be able to give you a different kind of inspiration. Or 1 Queen 5 Queers has a lot of different expressions shown that may help.

I also find the ""gender neutral"" section just male coded clothing or sacks of clothes and it sucks. Wanted to validate that you're not the only one frustrated there.

It may also help to find a support system of nonbinary or trans folks that are nb fluent to talk about expression since I personally read a combination of dysphoria and an analysis of how others would read you in your post. Sometimes talking about these things in a support group setting or just in a conversation can be helpful in working out what makes you feel good and happy. Or work with a nonbinary therapist, the last two I've had have changed my life.

I get a lot of happiness from younger nonbinary people who are wild with their expressions, TikTok can help with exposure to what they're thinking and expressing.

I know I don't have your background or your experience. I'm excited for you to find what makes you feel whole and I believe in you.
It‚Äôs harder to look genderless when you aren‚Äôt super young. I have found it hard to find examples of people who look like me and examples of clothing I like. I have found it extremely hard to find clothes that work because female fit clothes just don‚Äôt fit me becuase of my shape and male clothes don‚Äôt come in colours and patterns I want. What I want is more feminine clothes designed for my body type and they don‚Äôt exist. What I have done is spend hours on eBay and sites like asos and picked up a few clothes that make me feel better but I haven‚Äôt really found what I am looking for yet.
I have accepted that, as a TShirt and jeans person with wide shoulders and a 5 o clock shadow even after I shave, even other nonbinary folks are going to repeatedly misgender me unless I wear a ""they/them"" pin on my chest at all times, and have decided to fall back on ""I‚Äôm too old to give a shit.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt know that searching on the internet is a good way to get fashion advice. As far as the fashion industry is concerned, nonbinary seems to be reserved for people who have ever had boobs. For hair, I ended up just telling my hairstylist, ""I want to grow my hair out, and make me look cute.‚Äù He understood what I meant and I‚Äôm pretty happy with the result. So is my partner, which is nice since I think she historically prefers a more masc look on me.

I wear a lot of ""womens"" tops and socks and suchlike because they have better colors and patterns than stuff that is marketed to men. But I was doing that even before I was out to myself, so I am not sure if that counts. 

But others still see me as male, and I don‚Äôt know that that will change easily. Some of this is society. Culturally, it is much safer to assume that someone is a dude; misgendering a non-male person as male is typically considered to be a much smaller faux pas than  misgendering a non-female person as female. I can‚Äôt really change that; the most I can change is when and where I worry about it.
I am a 50-year-old jeans-and-tshirt amab enby. I am always read as male and I do not care any more. I wear a they/them pin.
My go to‚Äôs are a simple pair of leggings or slim cut jeans, and tee‚Äôs, or oversized button up shirts or tunics, either mens or womens if cut and color is flattering enough. I‚Äôm an AFAB, who looks mostly feminine, but I hate super femme clothing..and bright patterns. It can be hard to find the right clothes for sure! I think the perfect touch for making me feel pretty enough but not overdone is some mascara..maybe some basic jewelry.
I came to the realization I was NB at 39 so similar to you in that aspect. I've been wearing women's pants to work with either a blouse or pole shirt. I also have a goatee so it's pretty clear I'm AMAB. The softness and different fit of the pants is enough for me to feel mixed. I bought them all on Amazon using size charts and a measuring tape to get the right size. It may take some trial and error to get the right fit and feel for you.
It‚Äôs true. A quarter century ago, before I even had the language to be able to think of myself as nonbinary, I just knew I didn‚Äôt like being a boy but I didn‚Äôt feel like a girl either, but I was still somehow experimenting with my gender presentation, I would get called ""miss"" all the time. Now, it seems it‚Äôs basically impossible for something like that to happen.

Re: finding clients that work, I‚Äôve decided I need to just learn to make my own. It seems like the only way.
> I have accepted that, as a TShirt and jeans person with wide shoulders and a 5 o clock shadow even after I shave, even other nonbinary folks are going to repeatedly misgender me unless I wear a ""they/them"" pin on my chest at all times, and have decided to fall back on ""I‚Äôm too old to give a shit.‚Äù

üëç

I am another jeans-and-tshirt amab enby, old enough (50) that I do not care what others think, but I wear a they/them pin most times so others feel less alone. Nice to know there are others like me. üòä

> But others still see me as male, and I don‚Äôt know that that will change easily. [...] I can‚Äôt really change that; the most I can change is when and where I worry about it.

I aspire to this goal.
Last time I bought a new they/them pin, I got into a conversation with the (also NB) store clerk about how, when you‚Äôre a T shirt and jeans enby, it doesn‚Äôt seem possible to avoid being misgendered. This despite a T shirt and jeans being just about the most gender neutral attire possible.
Yes. I find it impossible to avoid being misgendered. Gender seems to be read as femme or non-femme, so jeans-and-tshirt is read as masc when worn by an amab person and androgynous when worn by an afab person. Even when they are exactly the same clothes, in exactly the same cut. In the absence of cues from clothing/hair/makeup, people pick out the slightest cues from physical size or shape. Now I understand why trans women put so much effort into conforming to stereotypical gender expression with hair, clothing, and makeup."	xi6bvn	NonBinary	12	0.93	2022-09-19 08:44:55

New and confused	"Hi, I currently go by E and I've recently discovered that I may be trans.

I currently identify as an AMAB Non-binary person and use they/them pronouns; and I recently looked on this subreddit and saw posts discussing stuff about being an AMAB Non-binary person and about Dysphoria. They were quite helpful in narrowing down how I feel about my gender. First of all I actually didn't know that AMAB Non-binary folk were rare which is quite interesting but additionally it was quite informative looking at how another AMAB enby has experienced gender themselves. Now onto the stuff about Dysphoria, the post simply asked 'can you be non-binary and not experience dysphoria' and the replies were really interesting. I originally thought that to experience being non-binary or trans you need to have dysphoria but hearing that it's more about the euphoria is really helpful! Most of this gender questioning stuff is quite recent for me but I did experience something similar like a year or two ago. Anyway as stated previously I currently identify as an AMAB Non-binary person but I think I may also be transfemme. It's hard to describe how I feel about it tbh, I haven't really considered that I may be transfemme for ages because I was in the mindset of no no I must be a man and all that jazz (before discovering that I am non-binary). But recently I have been mulling over the thoughts in my head and being a 'woman' does give me joy so yeah I dunno. I do think that wearing and doing more feminine things would make me happy and the same for occasionally being androgynous in my expression. I'm gonna continue researching and looking into this stuff but I'm open to hearing other's perspectives on what's going on in meh brain.

(P.S. Sorry if this is incoherent or if it doesn't make any sense, these are basically just my thoughts written down with my knowledge about this stuff)

(P.S.S. Feel free to correct me on any of this btw)

&#x200B;

Thanks for taking the time to read this."	"(Nothing to correct that I can see, so you‚Äôre all good here!)

I don‚Äôt have much to say other than that being a non-binary trans-woman is also valid. There‚Äôs not really any wrong way to do gender, so long as it‚Äôs who you really are (and you‚Äôre staying safe). You can also take terminology without adopting femininity wholesale. That being said, of course, if you are in fact a trans-woman, I certainly don‚Äôt want to talk you out of it! I just want you to know that you can make gender work for you any way you see fit. It‚Äôs a construct, so construct it literally however you want.

I‚Äôm really happy that you‚Äôre finding yourself more and more!
Are you me?
Finally, another AMAB enby with a one-letter name. I'm G.
Thanks! I really appreciate it!

I think what I just need to do is to just experiment to just confirm my thoughts tbh.
Perhaps...
Nice! Hi G!
Joking aside, thank you for this post. It helps to see I'm not alone. I hope that you find a satisfying answer to your questions soon.
How's it going, E?
No problem! I'm glad I'm not alone as well and I hope so too.
There's dozens of us! DOZENS!
It's going alright I'm just chillin, wbu?
Same tbh.

Daughter	"My daughter (11 y/o) told me today that she wants a gender neutral name that her father didn‚Äôt pick out. They have a very strained relationship. Her birth name is Abigail Renee (Abigail means ‚Äúfathers joy‚Äù). She wants something gender neutral/non-binary.  Currently she‚Äôs thinking ‚ÄúOregon‚Äù, but open to ideas. 
So: A. Any non-binary names to add to her list? 
And also B: any age-appropriate books with non-binary representation?"	"I‚Äôm not great at name suggestions but for age-appropriate books with enby rep, I‚Äôd recommend the Witch Boy trilogy by Molly Knox Ostertag. Excellent graphic novel series features a nuanced, age-appropriate dialogue on gender roles as a form of magic and an enby main character, Aster. (Bonus, everyone in this series has a great name. Maybe your daughter can find some inspiration there.)

I‚Äôm also a big fan of the Lumberjanes series by ND Stevenson, Shannon Waters, Grace Ellis, and Brooklyn Allen. Besides featuring a cast of young women around your daughter‚Äôs age, it also includes a recurring character - Barry - who is canonically nonbinary. The series is wonderfully entertaining on the whole, too, and is fun to read, regardless of age.

Though not enby rep precisely, Girl Haven by Lilah Sturges is also a wonderful piece of trans-positive rep for readers your daughter‚Äôs age.

Hope those help fill out her bookshelf!
Ash?
Thanks so much! She does read Lumberjanes, but I didn‚Äôt realize there wasn‚Äôt an enby character. I‚Äôll have to ask her about it!
Just rented the Witch Boy trilogy despite very much NOT being 11, thanks for the rec üòÇ
Yeah, Barry is great! They start the series as a member of the Scouting Lads (akin to the Boy Scouts) but realizes they‚Äôre more at home with the ‚ÄòJanes, so they join them. 

There‚Äôs a supplement book to the series as well that your daughter might enjoy, the Encyclopedia Lumberjanica. It‚Äôs this little collection of historically significant lady-types like Octavia Butler and bell hooks and Sarah McBride that are both cool and inspiring to learn about.
Oh, I am far from 11, as well. What‚Äôs it they say? Young at heart? Or at least that‚Äôs what I have to tell myself as I add more middle level graphic novels to my reading list üòÇ"	rlv3d8	NonBinary	11	1.0	2021-12-22 02:49:18
"Ideas for nonbinary replacement of ""aunt/uncle?"""	"So I just found out that my friend is working on adopting this brilliant 5 year old, and since this friend and I are each other's found queer family I'm going to be uncle/aunt to this kid. 

Now here's the issue I haven't been able to find any nonbinary terms for that position that I like. Pibling just doesn't vibe with me cause it's too long, and none of the others sparked any gender joy. 

My partner and I are also moving in with my friend in about two weeks time so I don't have the usual months to come up with a term I like. 

So any and all suggestions are very much welcomed!! 

We live in a bilingual French/English area if that helps any."	"my little niece is calls me ancle (pronounced like ankle) which i find cute & funny
I use ""Avaun""! It's an archaic term, but as a history buff, that's fine by me.
I use ""entle""
I've heard of pibling as in parent sibling but personally I don't like how that sounds.
My friend came up with ‚Äúthunkle‚Äù for me. Combining them+uncle. Lol . I think it‚Äôs cute i haven‚Äôt tried it out yet since my nibling is only a few months and right now I just have my family use ‚Äútie‚Äù since Spanish is another language we speak.
maybe could use cousin?
I've heard entle, or personally I love entie:)
You could also go for a completely new word, if you don‚Äôt want to mix aunt+uncle, or similar solutions. My niece calls me Zeze (pronounced zayzay, it‚Äôs a similar sound to zio/zia, uncle and aunt respectively in my language). I just kinda reinforced a random sound she made and it stuck üòÇ
Some cultures consider cousins as extended siblings and aunts/uncles as well. Think of cousins as a second set of siblings and aunt/uncle as sibling once removed.

There's *nibling* for instance which builds from niece/nephew starting with an n. And it has nb in it so ++
My nephews call me Zizi.
My nephew was born before I realized I was nb. He can't talk yet but we transitioned from Aunt Jen to AJ. So you could pick a play on your name or just a nickname in general to make it less gender-y.
I like ""titi"" üßö
Before I realized I wanted was an aunt, auncle and unt were in play.
My sister-in-law called me untie. I kinda liked it.
I like the term Nuncle from A Song of Ice and Fire
That is really cute and made me chuckle!
Do you have a source for the existence of that word? I‚Äôm having trouble finding one.
Me neither, makes it sound like I would be the kid's sibling not another adult in her life. 
It's also really long compared to the binary terms and for reasons I can't explain that bothers me lol
yes, my name is Stellan and i'm thinking someday Tellie would be good. (not British, so it wouldn't be confusing lol)"	qm0fg4	NonBinary	11	1.0	2021-11-03 18:09:25
Euphoria just from recognition	"Just wanted to share some joy - I've just come out to myself and a couple of close friends as some kind of not-cis, and decided to own 'girl me' (I'm amab).

I realised that I've always played with androgyny until the last few years when I'd got stuck in full on masc mode. And that being stuck there had made me profoundly miserable.

Just recognising this has hugely improved my mood and self confidence, and made me more comfortable with both femme and masc aspects of me. It's like coming home, honestly. Just pleased to have found part of myself again, and excited to reintegrate her."	"Glad you‚Äôre home now!

Happy Trans Media	"Just watched Paris Is Burning and am very very sad and upset. I would really love some suggestions on media about trans people that doesn't involve any violence or sadness. I know that's basically nonexistent, but if anyone knows any I would really appreciate the recommendation. 


p.s. Paris Is Burning is an amazing documentary and most of it is so joyful and fun to watch, but it follows the lives of trans people in New York in the 80s so unfortunately one of the subjects does die. It isn't gone into too intensely, but I am very upset."	"Paris is Burning broke my heart, too. If you're open to a book, can I suggest The Craft of Love by EE Ottoman? It's a novella and a very quick read, but genuinely one of the sweetest, warmest love stories I've read. It's a queer historical romance set in 1800s NYC, between a silversmith and a quilter who fall in love while working on commissioned pieces for each other. It's almost completely devoid of angst, just two people learning to see and appreciate each other and figure out a path towards building a relationship on their own terms. The book is like the emotional equivalent of curling up by the fireplace with a big fluffy blanket and a hot cup of tea.

AFAB feeling their femme side again...	"Hi everyone! I love this beautiful subreddit. Seeing the pics of you all brings me so much joy. 

I came out as non-binary almost a year ago. Since then I‚Äôve gotten really into more masc presentation. I cut my hair short, wear mostly men‚Äôs clothes, etc. 

However, lately I just can‚Äôt deny it ‚Äî I miss being femme! I was pretty femme before coming out ‚ÄîI guess you could say Tomboy Femme ‚Äî and I just miss it. I miss the clothes, the nail polish, and feeling fabulous! 

But now, I‚Äôm dealing with so much shame and imposter syndrome. I‚Äôve recently started going back to work in the service industry and everyone calls me ‚Äúshe‚Äù. I feel this will only be exacerbated by more femme looks. Most of my friends are cis and I fear they will think I‚Äôve just been faking something. 

The thing is, I know I am non-binary, it feels so much better to me than being ‚Äúa girl‚Äù, ever since I was little I knew I was not ‚Äúa girl‚Äù, I wanted to be able to be fluid, not pinned in a box. And that‚Äôs all I want now too! I love having my chill masc days but I am dying for some sexy femme nights! Is this allowed? I‚Äôm so confused üò´

TLDR: I‚Äôm AFAB, been doing a heavy masc presentation since coming out last year, now really yearning for femininity. Struggling with imposter syndrome and confusion and looking for support!"	"Presentation doesn't define gender. You can present as fem as you please without invalidating your non-binary identity. Will people see you and think that you're a girl? Maybe so, but people not understanding non-binary gender identities is hardly new or rare, and in the end you don't get to control what other people think. Live your authentic life and make the presentation choices that bring you joy.
Present however makes you happy! Feeling like you have to present masc because you feel like you need to fit your NB label isn‚Äôt gonna make you feel good! There‚Äôs no gate keeping here! You know your NB and that‚Äôs awesome and you are always welcome! Present fem, present masc whatever you like just be true to how you feel and be happy ü•∞ü•∞
Ok I'm in the same boat as you. I'm Afab, and while I have some mild dysphora about my breasts, I do like my hips, genitals, make up,...

I've known I'm non binary since a long time but only recently realized that I want to present that outwards, get top surgery, and so on. I was really confused about myself and did a lot of research in the last month (I kind of needed to justify it to myself). So here are my conclusions, maybe they can help you:

We live in a society that likes to put people into boxes. Currently the boxes people will try to put you in in regards to gender are either male or female. Even if you mastered the androgynous look, people on the bus or on the street that don't know you will check you out and wonder in which of those boxes you fit. They will look at your curves, your clothes, your hair, will listen to your voice and in the end they will most likely decide to put you into one of those boxes, which is shit. The thing is, this is most likely not going to change, even when society becomes more educated on the topic of gender not being binary, because there are nb people that don't look completely androgynous and there are binary people that look androgynous and both of those things are completely valid. We can only hope that in the future people won't just assume your gender but ask you what pronouns to use for you, even if you look more like a binary-gendered person.

I know that is kind of a shitty, sad outlook, because the ""best"" thing you will ever achieve is to make people think more about you gender and wonder what you are. And while I understand that it can be nice and kind of fun to have people wonder about it and be confused, if you prefer to wear and do things that are more associated with one binary gender, things boil down to one question: Do I prefer to do and wear those things or is it more important for me to confuse people and maybe make them wonder and maybe question the whole ""putting people into boxes"" thing? This is a decision you have to make for yourself, I've decided that I prefer to just do what I want and fuck random people and what they think of me, but both choices are valid, it's your body, your choice and your gender.

If your friends think you are not a valid if you don't present androgynous, they don't get what being non binary really means. Things like make up, hair style,... are only gendered because society said so. There is no other reason for it. Your gender identity on the other hand is not a social construct. I, for example, have some mild dysphora about my breasts and will get top surgery soon and I'm like 98% sure that I would also want that if breasts were not associated with the person having them being female. I can't explain to you why and how that works but that's how things are for me.

Conclusion: You are completely valid, no matter how you look and what you do!"	n6gz2q	NonBinary	9	0.92	2021-05-06 20:35:28
What makes us valid:	"I've seen a lot of people posting in this subreddit asking ""If I do this or that am I still valid?"" And I wanted to  Make a post about this so I don't have to leave the same comment on multiple posts anymore.

If you are non binary, then you just are. There are no requirements, there are no rules or regulations that make you less non binary, literally nothing you do can change that. If you wanna go by your birth name, then you're still non binary. If you don't mind using ""he/him"" or ""she/her"" pronouns, then you're still non binary. There is no one way to be non binary, it just means that you don't identify with male or female. If it brings you joy to be called non binary and you feel like that label fits you  congratulations! You're nonbinary. You don't need to meet anyone's standards for happiness except your own. I love you little baby enbies, and I just want you guys to know that."	"Nobody will give us permission nor validity. We have to do that ourselves, and sometimes that takes a lot of work. It is not easy to get over our own hangups, but it is worth the effort.

FtNB low-T Experiences Please	"Figured out I was NB about 7-8 years ago. Just realizing that helped me so much but have accepted lately that I need more than just realization. Like I love beards. The euphoria I get imagining myself with a beard or when I carefully mascara my face is immense. Pure fucking joy I have never felt looking at myself in any other way. Whenever I look in a mirror I imagine it there, I can‚Äôt help myself. It is my real self. 

Was supposed to get a breast reduction a few years ago but days before surgery found out I was prego. I‚Äôm still breastfeeding my kiddo right now but that will be ending in the next year and so I‚Äôm exploring my other options in addition to my breast reduction (which is actually for shoulder/back pain from my large mammaries and not for gender dysphoria but on the sly will also be gender euphoric).

I‚Äôm thinking about testosterone. Would love to hear from others their experiences with low-T. How has it affected you physically and mentally? Any guidance or tips?"	"It's been lovely. After 13 months I tapered off in hopes that the permanent effects would suffice, but only lasted about three months like that and now I'm back at a super low dose. If I felt as you did about facial hair, I wouldn't have stopped it at all, and a more typical dose would probably be fine: that and the loss of head hair have always been my big reasons ""why not forever?""

Physically, it's everything a ""full"" dose could do for you, just slower and usually therefore less dramatic. People will tell you that eventually low doses add up to the same end result of ""full"" ""masculinization,"" but my doctor's opinion at least is that she's got multiple patients like me on very low doses who find affirmation without (obvious?) ongoing changes. I think perhaps the answer is that the human lifespan isn't necessarily long enough for it to always matter.
I'm on a fairly low dose. The only real difference is that the changes happen slower. What you get depends on genetics and everyone I've complained to about how slow my facial hair is coming in says it takes a few years most of the time (I was hoping for faster because I already had a mustache) pre t. It helps that I get gendered female less in public now too
I started out on low dose T about a year ago because I was nervous about permanent changes to my body and worried about hair loss. I ended up really loving all the changes on low dose, and about 4 months in I upped it to a normal dose. Almost a year on T and my chest size (while fairly small to start, has reduced almost a full cup size) and I‚Äôve loved it all! I‚Äôve also supplemented my hair with minoxidil to prevent loss and it‚Äôs been working great. the scariest part was starting but now I can‚Äôt imagine going back. for reference I identify as genderqueer and I‚Äôm 22. good luck on whatever you decide!
Low T is just slow T. Eventually everything will come (and the irreversibles will still be irreversible), they just come slower so you can get used to them at a slower pace but also sometimes stop if they don‚Äôt feel right before they‚Äôve come on so strong.
Couldn't be happier. I'm still on low dose despite leaning more solidly towards the masc side these days. I started with injectable and now I use gel. I love the small, subtle changes the best. Don't get me wrong, having a mustache is rad, but the things that give me real euphoria are things like muscle mass changes, the quality and change in my skin and hair, and the subtle change in my face fat distribution. Would do it again, and again, and again just the way I did.
!! i took a super low dose of t when i turned 18 for about 6 months until my voice dropped exactly where i wanted it, then i stopped :3c i just wanted to go down an octave
Thank you that was very helpful!
Love hearing the your chest size went down. Wondering if I should go on t before si get my chest reduction. Will def need to talk to my doctor about it.
Thank you. I looked up what‚Äôs reversible and what is not after your comment. I‚Äôm feeling pretty good about it.
I was shocked how great I felt when I changed up my contouring to mimic a more masc distribution so that sounds really nice.
That‚Äôs awesome!"	xnp44z	NonBinary	9	0.86	2022-09-25 14:39:33
Had an oof coming out experience with my mom today	"I've been wanting to be out for a month but I've also been having occasional fits of doubt where I feel like I'm just making it up for attention. I'm 99.9% sure that I'm non-binary and I experience a lot of joy when I try to dress and act in ways that aren't specifically gendered or which go against my AGAB. I've been realizing lately that a lot of the reason why I hate my body is likely tied up with gender dysphoria. I really should see a gender therapist to talk through this but I'm a very anxious person who hasn't even been able to go get medication for depression or anxiety, so seeing a gender therapist is pretty unlikely at the moment. I don't want to come out to my general social sphere yet because I still want to try out using my name and pronouns more first. They make me feel quite euphoric but I don't get to hear them used very often because I'm only out to my boyfriend and my DND group, and with how busy I am currently I only see them about once a week or less. I've been meaning to tell my mom for a while so that I can try stuff out at home too and today I finally worked up the courage to do it. 

I told her that I wanted to go by a new name, Hollis, and that it felt like it fits me far better than my old name ever did. She compared me to Flynn from Breaking Bad in a joking way which just felt like her trying to brush it off. I told her that I don't feel like a man and that I'm non-binary. The only response she had was ""Ok, goodnight"" and then she went to bed. I wanted to tell her about my pronouns too but she seemed very uninterested and left quickly. 

It's better than her immediately telling me she doesn't believe in this stuff but it still feels like she sees it that way. I don't really have any idea how she feels because she didn't even bother to comment on it. I hope that she brings it up tomorrow because after her response tonight I don't know if I'll have the energy to."	"Imposter syndrome is really common among trans/non binary folk so don‚Äôt let those moments make you feel any less valid than you are, because you are valid!!

I had some negative experiences with past psychologists but when the only person I came out to reacted really negatively I knew it was the only option I had and they have been so ridiculously helpful. I initially went in feeling as though I had to prove myself to them/wasn‚Äôt trans enough etc but they completely extinguished those feelings during my first session. I highly recommend making the time to see somebody, even if it‚Äôs just to talk through how you‚Äôre feeling with 0 judgment or pre existing ideas of who you are.

I tried initiating a coming out conversation with my father in the last week that ended with him telling me he didn‚Äôt want me to ‚Äòshove shit down his throat‚Äô and my only possible response was that if he didn‚Äôt want to know his child for who they were then that is his decision. It can be difficult feeling like you can‚Äôt live in your truth 100% when somebody important in your life decides to ‚Äòopt out‚Äô for lack of a better term, but i‚Äôm going to try and not let that hold me back from being who I really am, even if those around me don‚Äôt necessarily respect it. If it comes down to it, I hope you‚Äôll be able to do the same ‚ô•Ô∏è
Thank you for your reply. It's good to hear some first-hand experience with therapists. I'm going to try to force myself to see one in the new year and hopefully that'll help me figure some stuff out. 

I'm sorry your dad feels that way. That's really tough and I'm glad you're still going to proudly be yourself ‚ù§ I am going to try to do the same
You‚Äôre more than welcome!! ‚ô•Ô∏è I wish you well on your journey!"	e0vpa4	NonBinary	8	0.85	2019-11-24 07:58:53
Anyone else's brain just be a bitch to them sometimes? (Rambling ahead.)	"Isn't this all such a mind fuck? I have trouble with the fact that my gender is not based upon my anatomy/sex. But that's me. Agender being stuck inside a ladybod. Anyone else's head just spin sometimes, and you're just like, ""we've been through this before, brain..""? 

It feels right and good and correct to call myself Agender/nonbinary. So why do I question what I feel? Why can't I just feel confident in my gender üíØ of the time like cis people do??

On one hand, I love being agender. Falling in line with the term woman feels ok, but only like a borrowed jacket. It's just not my gender.

So it's great to have a label that sparks joy: agender. I want to look how I envision myself in my head; more ""agender"", which for me leans heavily into androgynous/masc. Going through with and exhibiting all of the outward expressions that point to me being agender (at least according to my mind) really feels good.

But on the other hand my brain is like, ""but you chose this. This is all a show. You're vying for attention. This is all an attempt to be ""different"".""

It's a mind fuck. What I want is to feel more confident. What I want is something solid to point to and say, ""see brain? I AM agender. It's a fact. Indisputable."" It's so frustrating to feel unable to validate myself to myself other than it feels right and good. I wish that were enough to shut up my insecurities/internalized transphobia, but its not.

I tell myself that what's inside me transcends gender. My core being is neither female nor male. Isn't that valid enough? Who can take away my self discovery regarding my innermost being? Apparently me.

I mean, it's a fair exercise, is it not? Imagine yourself without a body. Just an entity in space. Do you feel female? Male? Neither? Both? When I do this, I feel very confident that I'm agender. And I dont think that's a cis thought to have???? Lol I think I'm not cis, enbabes. üôà"	"Hey, I just wanted to say you have a real way with words, and I wanted to thank you for putting these thoughts out there like this. What you've written really resonates with me. I've known for a while I'm nonbinary, but my brain still plays the same tricks. I especially appreciate the idea of one's agab as ""a borrowed jacket"" that can be slipped on when needed.

Brains are dumb, and they're easily swayed by society, which is also dumb. But it seems like you have the clarity and confidence in yourself to overcome that.
I feel you. I‚Äôm NB but masc leaning and imposter syndrome sneaks in sometimes. I think it‚Äôs just our brains way of being lazy. Muscle memory defaults to being a woman because we spent more time in that mind set than we have NB, even though we resonate more with that identity. But the cool thing about the brain is that it loves positive reinforcements so every time we present in a way that is congruent with our identity, it saves that as a feel good thing. After so long, and after all the negative reinforcements that come from being gendered female, the brain will default to the one that feels better. If you‚Äôre anything like me, sometimes it also feels too good to be true and I have a history of unknowingly self sabotaging. It helps me to remember that each day I get to really be myself is a day that I can be proud of, good or bad. You got this dude! :)
A struggle I know only all too well... and put to words better than I could have ever hoped to articulate. Thank you so much for sharing this.
I have nothing sensible to offer because I think you actually have a handle on it more than it perhaps feels all the time. But I would love to see this post in a graphic novel form, like a wee zine. Good words.
Thank you that helps me a lot! üòä‚ù§
Thanks! ü§ó
You're welcome! That warms my heart to hear! ‚ù§

It‚Äôs been a rough day dealing with TERFs. To counteract this, for anyone who wants to: show me pictures where you feel in your absolute non-binary joy.		I‚Äôll give you a story? I‚Äôve been out for 5 years and  been able to have gender affirming surgery and dress how I want and present how I want every day in my life. Today I am leading a presentation and discussion with queer medical students on self disclosure of lgbtq identity and how this can be a facilitator to care. AND I was approached to give this presentation. I just feel like I am so so happy and lucky to be able to be myself in my work and be valued for that. ‚ù§Ô∏è	ypd1hu	NonBinary	10	0.86	2022-11-08 06:10:46
Anyone have some positive family interactions this Christmas?	I'm glad people have a safe space here to vent about all the horrible behavior they've been facing with their families, but I was hoping we could balance it out with some happy stories! Anyone whose family has been accepting and kind for the holidays, or even just had some nice little gestures from someone who doesn't quite get it but is trying, share your stories here! Hopefully we can share some joy and hope for our struggling enbies out there! And to everyone that wasn't so lucky, I am so sorry for the hurt you've had to face, and I hope you know that you are genuinely loved and accepted by all of our siblings here! Hopefully this thread cheers some of you up a bit!	"I'll start! A good friend of mine has a trans brother who is still a bit nervous about presenting in a masculine way, and for Christmas his dad got him a toolbox because ""every man needs a good set of tools."" I thought that was just kind of heartwarming, especially since he's only recently come out and his dad is having trouble fully understanding it, but he's trying
My blood family is across the country but they called, said hi, and wished me a speedy and healthy recovery from top surgery (got it on the 20th).

My partner's family has always been supportive of both of us. I feel like I've gotten closer to his extended family over the years and they've accepted me as I am. His parents especially have essentially adopted me into their family. I felt like I was blessed with a supportive family already but now I have two!
My cishet sibling and their spouse (I'm keeping this as anonymous as possible) are doing things like asking their very young child ""is (toy) a he or she or something else?"" and then using whatever pronouns the child says.
I‚Äôm Jewish so I don‚Äôt celebrate Christmas, but i still got some nice text messages from family and friends wishing me a happy holidays :) mostly I napped all day with my cat next to me and ate some good food, watched tv and did some needlepoint. Honestly bliss.
My kid is starting to doubt the existence of Santa so she and my husband decided to do a little ""Secret Santa"" between the three of us and she chose for me a pendant with a leather strap and my husband got me a newsboy cap and they both give me euphoria enough to compensate to the usual very feminine gift from my mother... (My nephews also got me a pocket watch still under suggestion from my husband). I love my family. I came out as masc NB around 10 months ago and my husband is still coming to terms with it and what might be ahead of us, but doing his very best. My kid is amazingly supportive, I love her.
I got a very nice cute strawberry sweater and it is BIG gender euphoria c:
A kid of a family friend said that it was brave of me to come out and change my name. A waiter wasn't sure wether to call me sir or ma'am. My mom traded pyjama tops with me bc mine triggered some dysphoria. Good times.
Awww, that is delightful! Thanks for sharing!
Awww, I love that!
omg that sounds like such a vibe. And I'm sure your cat enjoyed the quiet day at home too!
OH GOD MY HEART THAT IS SO SWEET
Awww, that sounds adorable!
Awww, those are all so nice. That waiter thing is an absolute goal lol
Thanks! I just got a COVID booster shot, so napping was really all I could do. Better 36 hours of feeling shitty than weeks of it. My cat is loving all the cuddles!"	ronocu	NonBinary	9	0.92	2021-12-26 02:57:01
I've been slowly coming out professionally :)	"In January, I wrote a lengthy blog post about my gender identity exploration and shared it on my social media which consists of family, friends, and business colleagues. At the time, I didn't really have any conclusions about labels or pronouns. 

Since then, I've largely settled into the nonbinary label. Agender or gender apathetic is sometimes more descriptive. For me, the NB label is useful for letting folks know: I am not a part of this binary experience. I'm also noticing my preference for gender-neutral language. I will accept he/him when used affectionately; I don't feel much of a desire to correct people and I'm *okay* with those. And, on the occasion, she/her pronouns give me a little zing up my spine. I don't identify as a woman...I just love that if someone feels a desire to call me such based on presentation, I'll joyfully accept.

What's on my mind today is the fact that I haven't publicly discussed the above yet. I haven't even really talked about many people with it. It's not that I need to. I just did everything so publicly in January and since then I've been developing notes for a robust follow-up piece with my musings and understandings.

Last week, I was interviewed for an award I'm receiving at a lawyer conference in October (I'm not a lawyer, I work with lawyers). The award is for being an innovator in my industry. I was interviewed because they're doing an article on me in their magazine and I was sent the first draft and given the opportunity to do edits.

So...I edited :D I edited out *all* of the pronouns used to describe me. Ha! I'm a copywriter, so wordsmithing is my jam. There are so many ways to write a sentence and compose paragraphs to write in such a way that you need far fewer pronouns than people typically use. And once the frequency of pronouns is reduced, I just use my name when I need a noun: Luke.

Partly, I liked not using they/them because there are a variety of times in the article where I'm quoted talking about the general ""they/them"" in a plural fashion, so I wanted to eliminate pronouns about me so that it made the message clearer. 

Partly, I just like being Luke. If someone were to ask, ""What are you? What pronouns do you want?"" I would say: I'm a Luke. :D

In the past couple of weeks, I've started exploring being more public about my nonbinary identity, sharing it when relevant with professionals I barely even know. It's been something more private and I haven't brought it to my professional work much. In the coming months, I'll be attending and speaking at multiple conferences. I've purged my wardrobe of masculine clothes and have opted for clothes I love and adore, all of which are more stereotypically feminine.

I'm not gonna lie...there's some discomfort in being public about my nonbinary identity in a professional environment. It's not just that I'm attending conferences...I'll be on stage. I don't know what I'll wear yet. I'm both mildly scared and experiencing delightful exhilaration. Because of COVID, I haven't had to answer the question of what I will wear to professional events. Now, over the next few weeks, I get to start answering that :)

This sub has been a wonderful resource for me. It has been in reading others' stories that I've nestled into the label ""nonbinary"". At various points, I've read folks' stories here and I have thought, ""Ah, yes, these are my people.""

Love you all,  
Luke"	"Thank you for this post. It is quite timely for me. I‚Äôve been coming out professionally in an implicit way really. I‚Äôve been having some fun exploring my gender expression over the past year working from home, daily zoom meetings sometimes raise an eyebrow, but so far all of my colleagues have been sweet. Once or twice I‚Äôve had a question about my eyeliner or lipstick, which in a way I enjoyed answering because everyone seems so accepting. 
I think most people can be accepting, they just haven‚Äôt seen enough representation to normalize non-binary identities in their own minds. 
I hope more representation in public will open minds, and in turn lead to better acceptance. 
Good luck.
Thanks for sharing üíïü•∞ the nice thing about my Facebook is team members/employees, friends, family, and biz relationships are all on there so a lot of people saw when I initially started sharing my exploration of agender. To my surprise, the first message I got was from a guy who owns another agency. I do t wear makeup much yet so it‚Äôs mostly been visible in my feminine athletic wear. Being on stage is gonna be a bit different‚Ä¶and yet all the same. I, too, think people seem generally accepting, even if they don‚Äôt share my views on gender. And I think that‚Äôs where the beauty is, being able to coexist and love each other without having to share views. 

I‚Äôm sponsoring a diversity/LGBTQ event at one of the upcoming conferences. Me presenting with an appearance I love is just one more important facet of helping others have experiences with folks outside of the binary. 

Rambly thoughts on a Wednesday evening over here :)"	paodri	NonBinary	10	1.0	2021-08-24 14:25:12
