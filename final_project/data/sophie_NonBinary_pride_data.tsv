The designer is Lirika Matoshi :)

No suit is complete without a little ✨pride✨ (yes, that is an enby pin 😁)		"Wow, you look stunning! That’s some BDG energy :D
This pic gives me John Mulaney vibes
Whoa. You look amazing!

Quick question:
Where did you get it? I've been looking for a suit for quite some time but I haven't found one yet.
In case anyone else is wondering, the pin I think is from the wonderful yas.petit.poulet! They are making a periodic table of pins for all different queer identities!

https://www.yaspetitpoulet.com/
I love this blue! What a great look! 👍🔥
Amazing suit, would wear!
I love it all! What a great look!!! ❤️ the suit is 10/10
You smashin it :)
Damn, your gender is yes
Wow, you look absolutely amazing!! I mean, wow. I'm AMAB and recently out as nb. I am going to a couple weddings this summer and actually have a suit that is a similar shade of blue. Do you (or anyone else) have any advice on accessories or other ways to style it so that I present a bit more fem?  Thank you in advance! 💖
You look awesome!
You remind me of that lawyer from Ace Attorney
Is that also a Stingray? Or is it a Sterling? I can never tell the difference
Love the suit!
Love your clothing and hair style!
The outfit is amazing!! May I ask where you got the badge???
Where’d you get the suit? Looks great!
You look presidential as FUCK
Looking good, friend!
oh wow 

so cool!!!!!!!!!!!
Yo, I know that you're supposed to be the center point here, but like, that bass is epic.
What did we do to deserve your gorgeous posts? Like I just want to see a pic of your wardrobe at this point. Like every single outfit is so incredible. Also I love your tie, especially the length because its this perfect awkward not short not long in between thing and I just love it and I cannot get over it
You look fantastic. Little tip: traditionally the end of the tie should reach your belt 😄
How does it feel to be a god amongst mortals?
I got big gender envy for the suit, tie, pin, but especially for the stingray bass
Ahhh, you look great!
What if it was an asexual pin. Then you could be Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (I kid I kid. I'm sorry)
THIS IS THE MOST GENDER ENVY IVE FELT ALL WEEK
My bisexuality levels went 📈
You look so good!! Goals 100%
Plz take over the world.
thought this was the hunter x hunter subreddit for a second cuz holy shit you look so much like leorio !!! i love it ☺️☺️☺️
Wow
You look great but that tie knot is too short , is it intentional ?
Nice bass
I gotta say, I get Pheonix Wright vibes from you- in the best way possible! :D
OMG THAT IS FANTASTIC YOU LOOK STUNNING!!!!! Don’t drop this 👑(even non-binary people can rule the world) - a fellow enby
Firstly, glorious suit and perfect colour!! Really suits you.

If I could give you one tip, though, is to have your tie come town to your belt buckle. Short ties make you (and not YOU specifically, but everyone) look like a kid playing dress up. Just have the tip of the tie brushing the top of your belt buckle and it'll look more cohesive.
they look so cool
Ahhhh you look amazing!!!! 💕💕💕
Iconic! So amazing and as my mother would say, sharp.
i love it the outfit looks like leorio's from hunter x hunter!!!
You look awesome! :D
Looking sharp!
damn boi/gurl u look awsome!. (idk if i should do boi or gurl i dont wanna offend you.....what about amazing being?)
Absolutely iconic!
BEEEEAAANNN
Holy fuck holy fuck you’re  H A N D S O M E
I was thinking what could G stand for that makes Big Dick Energy gender neutral, then I remembered Brian David Gilbert exists and is delightful
Thanks!! 😁
Yeeees 😍
I was gonna say!
I sell mens formal wear and I'm really good at fitting female bodied people! If you have/can achieve a flat chest the egara orange extreme slim fit suit is what you want! Most female bodied people fit into a 35S (the smallest size). Thats what I'm wearing! 😁

If you can sort of explain your body type I can recommend something for you?
same!!! any hints in the righ direction would be HUGE
Thank you! 🤗
Thanks! :)
Thank you!! 💞
Accessories! You already hit the nail on the head. Add texture and/or patterns in your tie, pocket square, shirt. Jewelry, anyone? You could throw a scoop neck shirt and some pearls under the jacket...there are lots of ways to play with suits and gender expression. Heels? Perhaps a purse? Nail polish (french manicure if you want to keep it to high class gender-bending...) Eyeliner is awesome with suits, in my opinion. Find a dress shirt with lace or ruffles.

Ok this is like a passion of mine, if you slid into my DMs for specific advice I would be enthusiastic... 😉
Big Dick Gilbert

I'm on the curvier side of the female bodied people. Slightly chubby, 5'7ft 154lbs. With a binder I get a pretry flat chest/ looks like big chest muscles. Any recommendations are welcome 🤗🤗🤗.

Thanks in advance!!!
Hi I'm about 5'1"", 210LBs and am pretty curvy/have a big chest and would love to hear some suggestions! I'm just trying to look as good as you in this suit 😭💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
>scoop neck shirt and some pearls under the jacket...there are lots of ways to play with suits and gender expression. Heels? Perhaps a purse?

These are all fantastic tips, thank you!! And I just might take you up on your offer for specific advice in your DMs 😃
The brand Pronto Uomo would probably be best. It has room for curves and isn't top hard on the wallet

happy last day of disability pride month from this disabled n-b trans guy		"I love your style!!
I like how your clothes match your chair! 

... bit of an odd compliment, but I also think your hands are very hand-some :P
[deleted]
if anyone’s interested, I wrote a long post on my relationship with disabled pride on [my instagram ](https://www.instagram.com/yes.ellis/) and there’s also several T updates on there (I’m 10 months on T currently). always looking for more nonbinary & trans folks to follow!
You look awesome! I love how you look.
The fit is great! 

And your hands should be illegal, dude
I love your outfit!
Cutie. Your style is poppin
You've got a coding at 3am vibe
YOooo I love your style!! Where did you get your hoodie shirt thing? (Where do you shop in general-)
Yay another queercrip in the wild
you are an earth angel 🤩🤩🤩
😮😮😮😮 wow you look incredible!
Damn, you're handsome !
Time to step my wheelchair pose game up because damn! 💜

Hi I'm in love w you😩💞
Your aesthetic is amazing!
How are you so freaking hot? Serious question
I know people keep saying this but adding one more ""goddamn I love your style"" to the pile
[deleted]
Do not despair, Icelandic pride month, as well as pride in quite a few nordic countries, starts August 1st
r/streetwear wya 👀✨
I am absolutely so in love with your entire outfit!
Happy disablity pride
Dame you look bad ass! I kind of remind me ove the game watchdogs. I think you would fit in there very well
Damn dude what a LOOK. I am obsessed! 🖤🖤🖤
You look like the guy version of Vennessa from Phineas and Ferb and i think that might be the highest compliment out there.
A fellow nb wheelchair user who also likes plants... Legit I would love to befriend you. Pm me if you feel the same. 

Either way, you keep being you, you bamf!
He’s soooo hot I’m!!!
Awe amazing
you’re so hecking cute damn
Oh gosh you're so handsome. The kind of handsome where if I tried to talk to you irl I'd get tongue tied and say something that wasn't a real word or something and then shuffle away awkwardly.
You are beauty personified
U look so cute and cool <3
Ain't nobody got business looking this good
You look so good!
hi fuck ur pretty & i love ur plamt
HOLY HELL 😳💞
U really cute
I didn't realize there was a disability pride month! I'll have to start prepping now for our 2 months of pride next year.
Hottie 😍
Out here lookin like a 

FULL COURSE

FIVE STAR

MEAL

Platonically tho mid me with that romo shit
Love the fit and your vibe! Hope you had a great and gay last day of disability pride month!!
🔥🔥🔥
I just want to say that you pass really well! Also, I LOVE that outfit
You slayyyy! 😍
I haven't read your instagram post, but thank you for posting. I am starting to have to use a cane for my disability (lupus and fibromyalgia). I've had these disabilities and pain for a long time, but I am finally taking the plunge to use a cane.

I'm 26, and people love to tell me I can't be sick. I know it will get worse when I get the cane. People will be telling me I can walk fine, etc. I am trying to mentally prepare for hearing that twice as much. 

I am grateful for this post. I feel less alone.
You look awesome and are kinda goals! Btw I love your clothing style
YES ✨
Nice, I got the same sweater, love it!
Queer cripples are the best cripples and your boots are amazing.
If you’d like to join us, r/DisabledPride is now open!
you are an inspiration
I'm I disabled in peoples minds? I got shot through the brain and the military is paying me for the rest of my life, but I'm going to college and getting decent grades and can pretty much move fine.
aesthetic af
We stan!!!!!
thank you!
haha thank you! my hands have really transformed on testosterone and I’m loving the change
aw thank you!
It's a little crazy seeing another nonbinary trans dude with a chronic illness. It's hard dealing with two issues people sometimes see as ""attention-seeking""
Just followed you. I’m always looking for other trans/non-binary disabled folks to follow!
aw thanks! I love how I look too thanks to 10 months of testosterone! it’s a good feeling
hahah thank you! be gay, do crime (like having hot hands??)
thank you!
aw thank you!
alas, I cannot code, but I’m glad I give off such a vibe
thanks! this entire outfit is from bershka lol, most of my clothes are from there + asos. bershka in particular is great as a tiny trans dude because their trousers are unusually short legged and their XS shirts fit me nicely
there’s loads of us!
aw thank you!
ah thanks!
cheers!
hahah the secret is being very vain and taking lots of photos of yourself. that + slouching a lot lol
aw thanks! the whole outfit is from bershka actually
thanks!
thanks!
aw thank you!
thank you! glad to have taught you about it’s existence!
happy to hear that!
love + solidarity to u!
well now you know!
aw thank you! the sides are due a shave but considering I haven’t been able to go to the barbers since lockdown started I think it’s looking pretty good
wow I’m honoured 💞
thanks!
hahah a combination of genetics, testosterone, confidence & good lighting I reckon?
hahah well it’s a compliment I’ll never tire of, especially since I had basically no sense of personal style pre-transition so it’s nice to have finally found what works for me and feels good
hey thanks!
pride is never ending!
hahah I’m too disabled and too trans to post over there but I do browse there from time to time, my style is definitely very streetwear influenced
aw thanks!
thanks!
I haven’t played it but I googled it and that definitely feels like a compliment so thank you!
aw cheers!
hahaha I love this
aw yes please feel free to dm me on here or IG!
hahah thank you!
hahah well that’s the kinda shit I find very cute so it’d be all good. thank you!
this is very cute thank you
*oh shit i don’t know if ur ok with being called pretty i’m sorry ur very attractive. 
i’m disabled too i have service dog & not wheelchair & i think ur style & look r swell & i hope i look something like u someday lol.
yeah I got ill at 16 so I’ve heard a lot of that. people do get a different kind of weird about it once your disability is very visible because you use a mobility aid, but you get used to it and learn to tune it out for the most part. I really hope your cane is a helpful and liberating addition to your life!
we are the best <3 thank you!
hahah how so?
yea speaking of, is this one pullover sewed together or is it a shirt beneath a pullover?
I had never seen anybody talk about hands changing, and I was so fascinated by watching my partner's hands change.
of course! and if you ever doubt it for a second my DMs are open lmao
yeah I feel you, it can be a complicated combination of things to be. my dms are open if you even wanna talk to someone who gets it!
Right there with you. I'm non binary/genderqueer and have chronic illness...we feel rare, haha. Nice to see fellow people. Especially young ones, as we get judged so much for ""faking it"".

💜 all my love to my fellow spoonies!
Ooh I'm gonna go check it out, thank you!!
definitely growing out nicely! i’m glad i started growing my hair out before lockdown, i can’t imagine how annoying the length would feel if i was trying to keep it short. i feel for all of you
Hehe fuck em. A good fit is a good fit, even they couldnt deny 😤✨
Yey awesome! I will drop you a pm here!
You’re welcome 💜
I’m cool with any kind of compliment & like to think of myself as a pretty boy so that works for me! and thank you!
your confidence radiates through this picture. I think a lot of people in your shoes or similar would be inspired. I know I am
two separate tops!
this is so cute wow
Right!
yeah it’s not ideal! it had gotten ridiculously long and was getting quite annoying because it was covering my eyes lol but my partner cut it for me a few weeks ago and it’s now a much more manageable length
thanks, i was just wonder. 
u look awesome by the way ; )
i’m glad you’ve got someone to help maintain it in the meantime! i bet a lot of us are gonna come out of this with some level of hair cutting skill haha"	i1d2tj	NonBinary	3498	1.0	2020-07-31 18:45:35

Thank you so much for sharing with us. Much love and have a great pride!
YESSSSSSSSSS. I saw an article about how they're facing difficulty in the refugee camps and it boils my blood that people already suffering from being displaced have to deal with marginalization for their identity as well.
YEAAA you go 😁😁😁

Hey it’s me this is my new account"	uy5wl8	NonBinary	3446	1.0	2022-05-26 11:55:46
Made a lil pride flag on my vans!!		"I wanna do this to all of my shoes now!! Such a great idea!!
This is so cool, brb need to learn embroidery 🪡
You have Vans they were already part of official non-binary pride regalia!

Jk this fuckin rules.
Whoa this is amazing! Great idea! 😍🤩
THATS SUCH A GOOD IDEA DOING THAT TODAY
RIP to whichever finger (or hopefully thimble) pushed that needle through! Really cool work!!
Omg I’m obsessed!! 🤔might need to copy you…
Subtle, I like it!

I put beads on my hoodie strings, but I don't get to wear that in summer...
Oeh! I LOVE IT!
omg, this is adorable!! i work at vans and i *wish* they would’ve had more non binary rep (and other identities!) in the pride collection this year. they messed up the order of the colors on the trans flag too :/
super cool
So awesome 😍😍😍
I want to do this to my shoes now!
Aww that is a really good idea!!!
This is genius!! I am going to try it on mine!!
niice
Very creative I love it
Beautiful!
Very nice!!!
Based
I love this
Cool shoes😎
😍😍😍
Ahhh!!! That’s such a cool idea!
This so cute love this!!
I need to do this
Oh my word, that is the most adorable thing I've seen this week. I really want to own custom Converse roller skates one day, and I'll definitely be stealing this idea then!
what size needle did you use? it’s perfect
that’s so cute!
I dig it!
[deleted]
This is amazing! So subtle, really clever placement.
Love it !
ayyyyyy
I love it!! Thank you for the inspiration. :)
AYOOOOOO NICE DRIP
Why is that the smartest thing I've ever seen
oh my god i just got these shoes today, and you’ve given me an idea
You just gave me an idea 😍
Soooo cool!
Beautiful
aw so cute🥺💕 now I want to do this too
I think I’m going to steal this idea
I love it. Reminds me of r/VisibleMending.
… I may or may not have copied this with bi flags on the inside!
Same!☺️
I’ve just started learning it and this was a really quick easy project!!
Lmaooo i can do all my flannels too!
That was the hardest part😪
Absolutely!! Im gonna do it to my hiking boots too!!
They what👺🔪🔪
I wish i could say lol. I’m teaching myself to embroider and i just kinda used the first needle I saw that vaguely looked like it would accommodate the thread size😅
Kind of new to reddit so i dont know how to link a video but essentially I:

1. Used string from a friendship bracelet making kit because I dont wanna spend money on embroidery thread

2. Thread the needle by pulling the thread through a tiny bit and tying a very small knot on the long end

3. Start from the inside and poke the needle through along the edge of the white thingy (this hides the knot on the inside)

4. Make one band across by bringing the needle back down on the other side of the white thingy.

5. Come back up on the same side of the white thingy and bring it back down on the first side (do this so you wont get as much excess thread inside the shoe)

6. Now you should be back on the inside of the shoe near where you started. Tie a little knot and cut off the excess

7. Repeat for the other colors in the pride flag!!

Hope this isn’t too confusing
Silly question, but how did you hide the knot?
No silly questions!! I put both the initial and final knots on the inside of the shoe, and made them as small as possible so that there isnt a lump"	vc9hqa	NonBinary	3234	1.0	2022-06-14 18:01:27
Just your local nonbinary trans guy reminding you that the first Pride was a riot ✊🏻🔥 (He/They)		"[deleted]
I just love your whole aesthetic 💜
🖤🖤🖤🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
Hells yes✊🤙
You look absolutely badass
DON'T MIND ME JUST SWOONING OVER YOUR CUTE SPIKEY HAIR AND THOSE SICK ASS PIERCINGS 👀
Ooooo love the necklace!
Omg, you look so attractive and badass!
I love your piercings
[removed]
Love the glasses!

And your style!
your piercings are so cool :D
Love your aesthetic! (And your jawline, holy hell!)
Hell yeah PS your whole vibe is so punk rock, in the best way. Happy pride!
love how it's just two completely different facial expressions and vibes, but both aesthetic af and at the same time so different from the other, love that idk it has something artish to me
Can we riot again?😂 sounds fun
Awesome style. You look great.
Jfc I love your look!
I'm getting a somewhat hipster but mostly rockstar vibe. oh and a hot vibe. rock on 🤘🤘🤘
Hey sorry about the topic but I am person who is still confused and want to ask you some questions if you don't min
Your aesthetic is basically exactly what I'm working towards. You fucking rock dude
Hell yeah! Looking hardcore : )
You are cool
Nice. I do something similar around my eyes too. 😸
Badass 😍
Fuck yes!
You're beautiful 💖💕
Fuck yeah it was 💛🤍💜🖤
Nice camera angle, I love how it looks like you're smiling in the mirror.
I strive for this look
You look fucking awesome
Hell yeah you look so fucking punk here!!!!! You’re hot!!! Fuck it up fuck it up!!
Stonewall. We talked about it a lot in the queer community in the early 90s.
HOLY SHIT DUDE I LOVE YOUR STYLE 
EDGY ENBIES UNITE!!!! 🔥🔥🔥
GOD you're so cool dude 😭 i love your style and your piercings are sick too
I always struggle with if I want to 1. be you or 2. Fuck you.

Good lord you're attractive🥵
Yes, remember stonewall I guess. Tho honestly it's more relevant to focus on the future
Your style is immaculate
holy hell you're way attractive
Always wanted to do the eyebrow slit, very stylish!
how can you be non binary but have he pronouns ?
If this question is offensive, please let me know, I seek only to learn more about enbys like I've recently figured out I am. Could you go further in-depth about how one can be non-binary and a trans guy? (He/Him)
Definitely the Godlike shirt
Hell yeah it is! 🤙🏻
BRO YES

Good Omens is my all time favorite show and book, and Crowley is a major comfort character for me. The sunglasses are actually the exact same model as the ones he wore, Valentino VA2003! 😁❤️
I'm always down for a justified riot 🤙🏻
I mean, it wasn't fun, but it's probably called for.
Tho it’s important to respect those that laid the foundation for our future to happen. We wouldn’t be here and be as accepted as we are today without those who stood for our rights as valid human beings.
We focus on the future by not letting the past repeat itself, and to do that we have to remember.
It's never irrelevant to remember those who came before us, those who fought for our future.
Pronouns =/= gender. 
I'm sure this topic has been addressed previously by the subreddit, so I recommend researching it because they'll probably explain it better than I would 😊
Correct!
I have those exact shades too. They are gorgeous
Yes as long as it’s justified but then again the thing about those things is that people always get hurt
That is true we only riot when we are pushed to
I didn't say it wasn't important but, absolutely.
I don't get that logic, actually.
No, I didn't say it was irrelevant.
Riots happen because people are being hurt systematically, and no one is willing to address and stop it, unless there's a riot.
The logic is that if we don’t learn the lessons of the past, we’ll make the same mistakes. Oppressed groups don’t just magically stop being oppressed, it’s something we work at, often for generations. Stonewall wasn’t that long ago, and many of the circumstances leading up to it could happen again if we let it... and many of those circumstances still have not changed. Marginalized people are still suffering from systemic state violence today.
> Remember Stonewall *I guess*

Throw some fucking respect on the queers who struggled and suffered for the things we take for granted today.
Yea I know that much like the blm kinda turned into a riot cause people we’re tired and upset
Ok so it's how we prevent society from making the same mistakes. We need to remember the past because humans easily slip up and lose track.
absolutely, you can interpret my comment as being disrespectful. that is not what i meant at all. but if that is the universal interpretation of my comment, then i apologize.
Pretty much, yeah. And to keep the history. Because history can be erased, and at times has been deliberately.

Gotta love it when companies make accidental pride shirts.		"YOU. LOOK. STUNNING!
Lmao is that from primark? I've got shorts from there in that exact print
Enbies love a shirt sleeve print shirt
YOUR TATTOO IS SO COOL!!!
Yes, awesome shirt. But can we talk about that dagger and d20 tattoo....love it.
Maybe it wasn't accidental. Maybe a designer at the company did it on purpose. I sometimes put pride easter eggs in stuff I work on.
Love the D&D ink!!!  I have a fairy dragon down my bicep!
I love that so much, LoL.
Omg want
That shirt looks fabulous on you.

Also, your post reminds of the sub r/AccidentalAlly
That’s pretty awesome that you snagged that! And it looks really good on you!!
Cutie :3 *boop*
OMG I want it badly
Where did you get it? It looks wonderful on you! ❤️❤️
So for anyone asking, I got the shirt from an irish based chain called Penney’s/Primark. It was a few years ago now so unfortunately I think it would be hard to get your hands on one.
Yaaaaassss I have an accidental trans one!
That is an awesome shirt, but I'm going to carry on about the hair.
I love that shirt
That shirt is hella dope—!
I want that shirt
That tattoo is so sick that it should be wearing a mask 😷
I LOVE D&D, SICK TATTOO MY FRIEND
oh hell yeah 🔥
That's so sick
This is no accident. It’s part of the non binary agenda.
Where do I get one??
Wow, that's accidental? I'm kind hoping there's a covert enby somewhere in the design process lol
##AMAZING! I love this.
ENBY SHIRT!!!!!

i need 🥺 also hugs from the enby in it
Where did you get the shirt??? Pleaseeee
ya look great! but also PLEASE link to where you got that shirt i have an incredible need
Thank you! The lighting was kind to me 🙈
Haha yes! I used to have the shorts too but they didn’t suit me
It’s in the contract
Thank you! I love dungeons and dragons!
Haha thank you! I do love dungeons and dragons!
Nice! I would love to get a dragon tattoo in the future.
Actually the same shop had an accidental trans jumper that had fluffy pink blue and white sleeves! I had that for a while too lol
My hair? Haha it’s very nothing special
The agenda is ✨fashion✨
Unfortunately I got it a few years ago in an Irish store called Penney’s so I think they’re long gone by now
Yes sorry I don’t think it’s available unless it can be found second hand online somewhere 😞
""So for anyone asking, I got the shirt from an iris based chain called Penney’s/Primark. It was a few years ago now so unfortunately I think it would be hard to get your hands on one.""
I think you’d still look stunning with or without
It's you that's making the light look good.
Let’s be fair your hair was also kind to you
Do you have a link? Having trouble finding it.
Oooh!
Damn that’s stinky I can’t wear one to church as a “dress shirt”
oh hey thats no worry! thanks anyway!!
You’re very kind!
Really? Thank you! I feel like my hair is usually just like there lol. Not doing much.
It was a few years ago I’m afraid also unfortunately Primark don’t sell online
Nah I’m just gay😁
yeah I've been able to find some online resellers but it seems none of them have this one. Dang. Ah well, thanks anyways, it looks great on you!

Omg, you're so pretty! You go shine (the netrual term for queen, if that exist?)
Thank you! 😊
Thank you 😇
🥺 Dankeeeee, ja wenns wieder safe ist menschen zu sehen komm vorbei auf ein tattoo haha 👉👈
Thats so cool! Can you display it somewhere?
This is way too sweet thank you 😭🖤
💛🤍💜🖤
Uhm its still a little wet in the picture because i washed it 😅 it has a life on its own and does... Strange stuff 😂🤣 so i cant give you any advice
Thank youuu 🥰🥰
Thank you so much 😊 it feels great to have my flag here and be out and proud!
💛🤍💜🖤
Thank youuu 🥰🥰
💛🤍💜🖤
Ohh why thank you 👉👈🥺
Thank you so much! I wish you all the best and that you will be able to do so 💛🤍💜🖤

Happy pride to you 🥰

Thank you so much 🥰🥰

Thank you! It's a design from my tattoo artist, it's a spooky nun kinda situation https://www.instagram.com/nadelwaldt/
That's the artists instagram 🥰
Thank you, to you to 💛🤍💜🖤🥰
I really like the term ""you magnificent what the fuck"" hahaha
Thank you so much! 🥰🥰🥰
Yesss!! I checked your profile and love your tattoos btw!
Oh wow danke für das Angebot, aber dafür müsste ich mich eh erstmal für was entscheiden 😅 (abseits davon, dass ich erstmal so oder Kontakte wegen Corona und allem zurückgeschraubt habe und mich erstmal dran gewöhnen muss, Menschen zu treffen)
Sadly no
A shit tonne of hair gel and hairspray will do it, it would be a trial and error depending on your hair type, density and thickness what products will work best. But stay away from wet look gels regardless it won't look right. If your hair is thin I'd also suggest adding a volumising foam so it doesn't look flat
Oh that’s cool, thanks for sharing!

I don’t suppose you know if they sell the print somewhere online?

I looked at the insta they linked and saw their talented work, but didn’t see any merch like this (I may just be blind though, lol)
Then, you're a magnificent specimen with a stunning haircut
👉👈 Oh wow thank you so much! 😊
I checked your profile and got gender envy 😅
Verstehe ich absolut, und no pressure 🥰 hab ich auch so halb im spaß gesagt haha
I'm sorry to hear, hugs to you
My hair is thin so I appreciate the foam tip!
Thank you for your tips, i am still on the seemlessly never ending quest of getting my hair to behave...
Puh i bought it in person at my local tattoo shop, maybe you can send him a message and ask if he would send you a print? I dont think he has a online merch store rightnow...
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💕
Aww thank youss!
if you can get hold of the giovanni 2chic ultra volume mousse it's one of the cheapest high quality products around it was a game changer for me in terms of volume. The other ones are like a minimum of double the price
It took me a long time to figure out how to look after my hair. Hair is confusing and eternally stubborn in behaving how it wants to rather than how you want it to.  Dont worry there are many people in the same boat
No worries, thanks for the response!"	nv4mul	NonBinary	2926	1.0	2021-06-08 13:58:28
wearing pride flags at school 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ happy pride fellow enbys!!! - me and my friend		"I'm 27 and the fact that kids can do this at school now is just insane to me. It's beautiful, but younger-me is very jealous
I’m just sorry you guys still have school :(
Happy pride. I’m so glad you guys can be out about yourself like this. When I was a kiddo, it was definitely not like this. Glad to see my baby gays and queers living their best life ❤️
Even if school was still going I wouldn’t do that I’m not trying to get hate crimed.  I shall continue to be a kinda sneaky person.
reason #936238 of why going to a small school in a small town where there are no other LGBTQ+ people sucks and makes me feel really lonely:   
I can't do this
two people did that in my school today too
Whatever Hogwarts school this is I want in!!!!
Happy pride! You both look awesome
The dude in the back is drinking like he can't handle the queerness or is questioning his sexuality
Awesome! I did that as well with my enby flag. I was fully expecting negative reactions, but I didn't hear a single negative comment!
WOOO, Lets goo!!


~~also is homie in the back drinkin apple juice?~~
Y'all got some main character energy
spending my k-12 in rural arkansas, i would have jumped for joy at the sight of such proud, loving comrades. i’m a teacher now and wow! what inspiring students yall are. thank you both for being you and shining your light on everything you love 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 solidarity from colorado
I am not in school anymore, didn't even know who I was at that point, dunno what people would say about me, so hope everybody respects you for who you are!
Look at you little Qtees!! Good for you. 👏
Lmao do all classrooms have that exact same cupboard? Straight up thought this was my school but the roof is different lol
Ygs look great!! :0 Happy pride 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Eyyyy! Happy pride y’all!!! I love both of ur hair sm, absolutely killing it! Glad ur school/area is supportive :3
You both look amazing!!
Hell yeah! You rock that shit!
Woooooow I didn't even have the guts to wear a pride pin in HS 0\_0

Congrats!
:O this is amazing
DM me (or have your parents do it!) And I'll crochet you guys some rainbow shawls! So you don't have to hold that thing up all day! 😊
Damn my best friend and I were closeted all throughout high school 😔 you two are absolutely rocking those flags
i’d do this every frikin day but i don’t want to have to iron my flag again lmao
You enbys are adorable!
So AMAZING! I wish my school would let us do that- we tried and apparently it’s “inappropriate”. I’m so happy you guys get to show your colours.
I'm 20; my experience was that you'd definitely catch some shit for being flamboyant, but any open homophobia would get somebody shunned. There was definitely still the ""ram it down"" sentiment, though.

It's great if you're in school and you find yourself a queer group of friends (or if you find a group of friends before any of you know, and then it turns out that queer magnetism just happened)
Same age! I’m so proud of all the teens openly expressing themselves. When we were younger that would’ve been a big no. I’m also a bit jealous haha
I'm 44  and this is mind blowing to me. I'm very excited for these new gays and such, they can be and assert what they want. It's so amazing.
I'm 35 and my fucking jaw dropped seeing this. This is incredible and would have helped me accept myself much earlier in life. So happy these kids have an environment and friends that allow them to be so expressive!
me too we get out next week tho
we’re lucky we live in a supportive area
Mood. I was already bullied for because I'm autistic and ""acting weird"" in my small town, also for having an eating disorder so yeah would have never taken that risk. I'm presenting as GNC now and that's probably the furthest I'll go before moving away but yeah would have never done that when I was in school and would have had to talk to people.
yea lmao
i didnt iron mine kdjsjs
lmao it really is like this, every kid i sat with in high school was “straight” and now we’re all queer
Oh yeah indeed, I'm 19 and still friends with the queer peeps I made in HS
Same
I'm autistic, too~
my friend in the photo with the blue hair (which i did for her btw) is also autistic"	nwp9j0	NonBinary	2868	1.0	2021-06-10 14:40:16
Its my 18th birthday, my parents got me a non binary pride cake		"You're out here making us all jealous of your parents' support, AND making us hungry /s

But FR tho, happy IRL cake day.
My mum told me that the lady in the cake shop had never done a pride cale before, so the cake master was especially happy to work on this cake
Good parents :)
Well, don't leave us hanging - what flavor(s)?!?

Also happy birthday.
Omg that's so sweeet
Happy birthday!! 🥳🥳
Your parents are gods among mortals.
Omg I love your cake it’s so pretty!! And happy birthday!! I hope your day is fantastic here’s a present for you! 🎁
HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!! What I wouldn’t give to have had something like this on my 18th birthday, I didn’t even know this lifestyle was an option then haha. I’m so happy for you that you have a place where you’re loved, accepted, and celebrated for who you are (at least IRL, because you certainly are loved, accepted, and celebrated here)!!
That's so beautiful, my parents would get me a bat if I told them about me xD and not for playing...
they sound so sweet! happy birthday friend:-)
Happy Birthday!
It's so beautiful! Happy birthday, may your cake be delicious! Good on your parents for being supportive <3
THAT IS THE MOST WHOLESOME THING I'VE SEEN ALL DAY
happy birthday, pisces person !! from a fellow water sign (scorp)
I'm jealous lol.
Happy Birthday :)
What amazing parents!! Happy birthday, internet friend!
I would destroy that cake...after properly appreciating its beauty. Jealous!
Aww, how sweet! 💕 (Pun intended)
Happy birthday
hey im nb and my birthday was yesterday!!!
happy birthday!!
Happy Birthday 🎉
happy birthday! hope you had a good one :)
Awwwe that is so sweet
THATS SO SWAG OH MY FUCKINH JESUS CHRIST

God, I wish my parents were like this 🥺
I LOVE THIS 🥺❤️
Oh, that's so cool! Your parents must be pretty cool themselves for doing something like that. Anyway, happy belated birthday! 🥳

Validate me since it's pride month and my family won't.		"[deleted]
love the glasses and hair combo
Thude. Your aesthetic is evvvvvverrryyyythhhiiiinnngggg
I know this is kinda off topic, but I legit thought you were Brigette Lundy-Paine for a hot sec
You are valid as fuuuuuck. Your family is seriously missing out. Imagine sticking with a person through some of the most demanding parts of their life, then splitting as soon as they make an independent decision.
Valid and looking great fellow enby (or nonbinary person if you prefer!)
I could learn a thing or two from you. You also happen to be a beautiful person. +50 Validation Points!
This look is such a vibe 👏🏾
Amazing!!! You look so cool!!!
you don't need to be validated. what is valid? what isn't? who dictates it? for gender traitors such as ourselves we are valid to nothing, and that's amazing.

that said, i love that ur hair and glasses look like a particularly aesthetic arizona iced tea
you look hella funky
You are absolutely valid regardless of what your family says/thinks. 
Also, your style is super rad. If I saw you at a party I’d think you were really cool.
I absolutely adore that pin!
I love everything about your look! I used to have sunglasses like that and I miss them :)
omg you look so good i love your hair!!
You probably won’t see this, but you’ve been successfully validated
You look absolutely gorge!
The Deity of  Vibes
I love your hair colors!
Love love love your hair!
Eyyyy! Love the aesthetic, comrade! Where can I get those neat shades?
A) Hair colour is literally my favourite colour scheme of all time

B) Where did u get those glasses
Remember: you can’t choose who you’re related to, but you can choose who’s a part of your real family. They don’t have to be your relatives. If they don’t support you they don’t deserve to be a part of that family.
You are excellent and valid af! <3
You 👏 look 👏 perfect 👏👏👏
love then hair!! good gay look. great style
Are those the genderqueer flag colors?
This hit too close to home
You are amazing! Love your style! ✨
the gummy bear earrings are so gay, love em.
You are what I aspire to be
You look awesome!
I love the hair color
Do you pass all of the exit criteria?  Not sure what that would be but I can't validate without it.
Your aesthetic is GOALS!!!!
Holy shit! I love you style. You look awesome 😎
I love the face you’re making! Love the hair & sunglasses like a yoko ono!
My gosh you made my heat skip! You look like a rockstar.
Mom hugs here—- family is whom you choose.
that hair is popping!
Your vibes are on point and the gender envy is strong (also the glasses look awesome)
You look very pretty, i like your hair and how it goes from green to purple. And your earrings! They're very pretty and very unique just like you!
Ugh that HAIR!!! <3
I dig your psychedelic style.
Omggg the vibesss 💖💖💖
You look so cool!!!
Daaayyuuummm, do I smell a gorgeous nonbinary human? Why yes. Yes I do.
Whoa! Look at them! They’re so cool looking and they have really cool sunglasses. I hope they’re having a good day, and I hope their family validates them sometime soon!
You dope. Carry on :)
Gummy Bear Earing!

you look sick as hell, i love your earrings
the Es are backwards on your pin
Validated as an honorary Non-Binary
I love your they them badge! You look awesome!
Damn you’re whole aesthetic is just 🤌✨ and your hair is awesome
You spent a long time figuring out your place in this really crazy world, and you totally should trust your judgement! Not everyone is gonna be okay with you being where you belong, but that’s only their opinion, and shouldn’t affect you :)
Uhhh you're hot af and I'm gay helloooooo~
That is some cool fucking hair.
Your eyeliner is amazing my shaky hands could never. Also love the hair holy. You are valid as heck
Do you live in Gruene?? I, a fellow NB, live in Kerrville!! Your validation has gained an extra level of validity in my eyes for knowing Gruene hall.
My 4 yo little sister came when i was seeing you're post and she say ohh she's realy cute with her hairs
Is that earing a gummy bear? I love it.
Has anybody already mentioned the hair?

I mean \~*the hair???*\~
Dope ass earrings 
I’m gonna steal the mix-matched idea 💡
You look rad as fuck! 💕💖
You're cute af!
THEY look so great in THEIR sunglasses that I just had to tell THEM!!
You look amazing 😍
You are the themest of thems I have ever themed across. You are a sundae and you are VERY beneficial. The themest of Sundays. With benefits on the side.

I hereby validate you and your parking.
you look awesome, and not only are you valid, youre also appreciated and loved
love your hair! ÷D
*throws validation confetti*
Damn you look freakin cool
I love your hairrr 🥺🥺🥺💖💖💖
Let’s get one very OBVIOUS thing out of the way…….. YOU👏 ARE👏 VALID👏……. And nobody can tell you otherwise.
Super model
Love the hair and the glasses!
You’re cute af, and your hair colors are super kickass. Your glasses are insanely groovy and remind me of the 60s/70s feel of American cities such as Austin, Asheville, Portland (OR), Seattle, Denver….
Snake earrings are pretty much always good in my book—ESPECIALLY those ones.
Overall, I’d say you resemble a barista who probably writes, draws, and/or does things like music/photography. And possibly also rides a motorcycle. I can’t really see your tattoo, but it looks dope as hell.
You’re always absolutely valid and deserve so much happiness, even if your family sadly can’t see the full value of who you are.
I'm sorry about your family I hope they come around you are gorgeous my dear.
Amazing, adorable, and so very valid!! I'm Proud of you!!
No shock, but you are fucking awsome!
u look like the theyest them of all time
New enby goal unlocked
From one nonbinary individual to another, I see you😊 Happy Pride and keep being amazing!
✨amazing✨
I second this!
Yup ✨😩
I love the term “thude” and I am 100% going to steal that
Omg i looked them up and haha when I watched atypical I totally had a crush them haha
First time I've been told that...gotta go look them up. When my hair was longer I would get told I looked like Hayley Kiyokio lol
Exactlyyyyy!!
Bought them at a local vintage shop
Appreciate this so much ❤
wait the whole words are backwards
I be bartending at Texas's Oldest Dance hall in my spare time :)
🥲❤
Hehe yes it is❤
Do it! 🖤
I third this!
This was my exact reaction when I saw someone else use it! Use it with love and pride friend!
That's quite the compliment, imo

Well-deserved too
wait no
I fourth this!
I’m also going to spread the good word!
i fifth this !
Excuse have you heard of our Lord and saviour thude?
i sixth this!
Why yes I heard they stole everyone’s gender making them non-binary!
I seventh this!
Sounds like Thude is actually the Fae

I've started a line of Hidden Pride flags for all my enby sibs that can't be open about who they are for one reason or another. I stand with you, friend.		"If you'd like, please feel free to check me out on [Etsy](http://theythemart.etsy.com). Support helps me continue to make art full time. ❤️
Haha I saw it before I even realized what I was looking at
That's so pretty! It kinda makes me think of Welcome To Nightvale.
Wonderful 💜
Such a great idea!
I made a trans flag painting for my boyfriend cause his parents don’t support him🥺
I love it!!
I love this. <3
Thank you
Man, this is wonderful. I would’ve killed to have something like this back when I lived with my parents!
This is beautiful!!
This is gorgeous. :)
•SHE/THEY• 

 So pretty!!
I love this idea!!!
Amazing job.
Beautiful!! I loved it, it looks awesome.
This is really lovely work!!
These are beautiful! Thank you so much for what you are doing!
This is absolutely GORGEOUS!! I love this; I'm absolutely checking your store out when money isn't so tight. Thank you  for sharing❣❣❣
Brilliant idea I should put some things up in my room in this color so I feel less erasure because of my homophobic parents
Holy crap this is a fantastic idea.
This is a tremendous project. Thank you for the work you're doing
any chance u are gonna put up one with the ace flag? these are fucking gorgeous. thank you for posting
I LOVE THIS CONCEPT! Beautiful work, I just adore these. Such a creative way to incorporate pride into art!
Where do I get one?!?!?
A very touched and satisfied customer. Having just recently come to terms with my gender identity this means a lot to me. My partner knows and has accepted me. But I have yet to come out to anyone else. This will have a special place in our home now and after. Thank you so much.
I kind of have something like this... Almost everything I own is the colors of the trans flag. This is so beautiful though and I would totally support you if I could. Keep doing what you do! 💕
I’d love to “recreate” this on my spare time! Did you use acrylic?
Holy shit this I’d stunning
This is fucking beautiful.
I love art and I love this one two coz u shared the story behind it
This is genius. It's like one of those cool easter eggs people write about on r/FanTheories
i love it! looks like one of the 90s drawings my aunt has in her desert house
I'm such a big fan. I'm absolutely in love with your work. I wanna buy one.
This has welcome to night vale vibes
This is such a great idea!!! The telephone pole is so beautiful <3
Omg I love this!!
I fricken love this! I feel like it's perfect for peeps who are both out and not <3 hell yes!
the genderfluid one is so pretty 💜

edit: never mind it’s bisexual lol. still very pretty
Tbh I like these more than hanging a flag on a bedroom wall
So pretty...
Ooph Im disabled and I have barely got my Etsy shop to where it should be. I’m glad to see another enby getting full time and being successful *hug*
Beautiful and such a cool idea!
These are all so beautiful! I am still so unfamiliar with the different flags though, so I’m not sure what most of them are 😅
The agender one is beautiful ahhh
Yay! That honestly makes me so happy, I was concerned they were too subtle.
That's one of the highest compliments I think I could ever receive 😌
I second this, with a side of Desert Bluffs sun overhead.
That's so kind!! You're both so lucky to have each other ❤️
Me too 💔 we deserved better
Please don't feel any obligation. Money is secondary to helping folks feel seen ❤️
You deserve better than homophobic parents
I am!! I'm hoping to have the design done by the end of the month so keep an eye out ☺️
Happy cake day!! And you can get one on my Etsy. It's up in the comments ❤️
I'm working on Genderflux/genderfluid right now actually ☺️
I've considered making the designs onto large cloths similar to a pride flag but I'm not sure I'd be able to make it look as nice.
I'm disabled too, it makes me feel a little less lonely that another enby is like me.
Honestly same, but I recognized the agender one *almost* right away and that made me really happy 😊
We absolutely did. ❤️
Thank you, I really appreciate that. They’re at least at the I love you no matter now,  like a long while after they accidentally found out my girlfriend is trans and I’m Bi. But they were still pretty abusive about it for a long time and it occasionally gets brought up in not so great arguments. I’m just hoping to move out soonish so I can be myself with my gf starting hormones and they can cope in their own house and continue adjusting without me being around to be told shitty things when they disagree or are in a bad mood. 

I recently became less disabled because it turns out I am really allergic to gluten products and sensitive to some other foods so I’m in less of a huge flare up all of the time. I’m hoping to start building my Etsy shop because I make jewelry and many types of art and digital art. I’m hoping that maybe Just maybe I will be able to recover just enough, that  maybe I can work at the community college library because I have disability papers there. This is so much better than I’ve been in 2 1/2 years tho of constantly being so sick that it felt like I was dying.  So I’m hopeful, but I still think working on my Etsy shop would be the best fit rn for a little extra money because I’m still struggling right now a bit health wise.
amazing - bookmarked and ready!
aw, yay! your art is beautiful
 Awh Im really glad. I get excited when I meet other disabled lgbt people let alone another enby lol.
If you ever, and I mean *ever* need someone to talk to, please please don't hesitate to reach out. I relate to your experience in so many ways.
Hey thank you! I’d actually really love to talk to someone like me from time to time :) it’s nice to know that you relate tbh thanks bunches"	jvdjbf	NonBinary	2777	1.0	2020-11-16 19:43:03
The same for non-binary people, you don’t need dysphoria! Happy pride month!		"That’s what said to myself. And that’s how it all started for me. Then I came out to my wife. Hello dysphoria. Come out to a couple friends. Oh what’s this, yes even more dysphoria. As I become more comfortable accepting I am a woman, I am less and leas comfortable with my body or social mentioning of maleness. I hate being called sir!  Right now I am not out of the world so the sir thing happens all the time and it hurts every time. I never expected that at all.
Also, keep in mind that many trans people don’t experience dysphoria until AFTER their eggs crack. Just because you don’t experience dysphoria now does not mean that you won’t. Also, chances are high that you have experienced dysphoria and you haven't even realized it. This twitter thread lists some common ways people experience dysphoria without knowing it: https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215740224325783553
You hear that, Dysphoria? I don't need you, go away!
You know, I presented this idea to an ex of mine (who is trans), and she completely shot me down with 'no, your not trans' and stopped answering my questions or even acknowledging that I was talking, so I really needed to hear this op. Thank you. Enjoy my first paid award :)
Personally, I've never felt any gender euphoria. I just know of it, but that's it. I've only ever felt dysphoria. 

I'm happy for people who feel gender euphoria, but it's not like one is a better indicator than the other. They're just two sides of the same coin.
An important lesson I have learned is that ‘gender dysphoria’ doesn’t always indicate that you want to undergo physical transition. For many folks, dysphoria is about the separation of their perception of themself from that of the outside world, which can often be addressed with a change in pronouns or presentation, or even simply having their identity acknowledged. 

There is a misconception that dysphoria means “wants bottom surgery,” or “wants to fully transition,” but like trans identity itself, dysphoria is a spectrum. 

For example, I don’t personally want to medically transition, but I do feel deep dysphoria over the way my body is perceived and the social and cultural expectations that are placed on me as a result.
I didn't start getting dysphoria until recently when I cracked the nonbinary egg and now I feel it with my deadname, sometimes top dysphoria, in my experience it's like a lancing feeling in my chest and it hurts like hell.  I wish I had a more feminine body but like with broad shoulders?  I dunno that makes no sense.
I have no euphoria or dysphoria I'm just so indifferent / neutral either way but know assigned gender fits less than being non-binary.

No one way of being!
This! It never occurred to me that I might be trans, I just always considered myself a ""tomboy"" until the first time I did masc makeup for a cosplay and was like:

This is me. This is who I want to see when I look in the mirror. Look at how handsome I am!
you also don't need euphoria to be trans. (btw, if ur trans u innately have dysphoria. it may not be physical dysphoria and it may not be very strong, but its obviously there otherwise u wouldnt go through all the tough stuff that is included with being trans. for example, if a set of pronouns make u feel icky, thats dysphoria)
euphoria made me realise I was non-binary too!
I think this is kind of a misunderstanding of dysphoria/euphoria. It’s both the same coin, just two sides of it. I think any trans person means with dysphoria basically you feel different than your AGAB, if that isn’t the case, why ID as trans/enby
It depends what you see as euphoria because for me is really rare to be hyper happy I never had the magical aha moment for the topical things . I can be happy to wear binder for example but I never had the revelation moment
I have a lot of dysphoria with the male sex... I don't know if I am a trans girl or just am non-binary... I can only say that this makes me feel suicidal... It's been long 17 years of depression :(
I didn't have dysphoria when I first realised. I was happy for months! Then my mum found out that I was non-binary, and gave me so much dysphoria that last night I almost cried after realising that I can't move out yet. :)
Euphoria really helped me realise that I'm non binary. (With the pronouns he/they) and since I am not out at home I have people in the internet call me my preferred pronouns and name(moss) and it gives me so much euphoria that it helps combat the dysphoria that I don't have to deal with alot. And if I ever get questioned ""it's just an oc for roleplay(cause I'm in that community)"" or ""it's just a fake online name"".
Exactly! We shouldn’t define people by how much pain they’re in.
One of my earliest memories of feeling like I wasn't the gender I was assigned was when I was 8 and had my hair cut into a short pixie. I wore cargo shorts and baggy tshirts and I was ecstatic whenever anyone mistook me for a boy. And now as I live my life as a nonbinary person, if anything I feel dysphoric only because I know I won't be seen as anything other than a woman by society unless I medically transition, which I don't really want to do anyway. I guess that's more like social dysphoria...?
Exactly, why should we base our transness on suffering instead of joy?
Aaa this is so validating, thank you!! I get tons of euphoria from wearing a binder and thinking about getting top surgery one day (I’m AFAB), but I don’t feel dysphoria from the way I am now!
also this is a little reminder that gender dysphoria doesn't make you trans/not cis ! nobody can tell you if your identity is valid or not, only you can know who you truly are !
Is euphoria not an indicator of dysphoria? Genuine question. And even if you don’t need dysphoria to be trans, do you need gender incongruence? Thanks.
I’m having some conflicting things going on with trying to understand myself. I’m not sure if it’s jut the fact people have been using my name more often but I feel a deep sorta “cringe” whenever I hear someone say it. My non binary name is silly though so I don’t want to make people use it
One of the things that helped me realise I was nonbinary was recognising that I experience gender euphoria. I do get dysphoria sometimes, but that’s more to do with socialising and being perceived in a way I’m not always comfortable with, which then starts the feelings towards my body. I don’t want to be treated as a cis woman because I’m not, and that can be so draining and painful because it makes me doubt myself.

Working out what sparks *euphoria* instead in me and trying to encourage that as much as possible has absolutely turned my life around. I feel like for the first time since puberty really I’m comfortable in my own skin, I’m not confused about who I am anymore, I’m taking everything each day at a time but I just feel so much happier and lighter.
Someone really needs to explain this to my doctor. ""I am here to help PeOpLe WhO AcTouLy NeEd It"".
Euphoria figured it out for me. Dysphoria came after when I realised what I'd been suppressing for 25 years. So eggs, follow the euphoria.
I haven’t ever felt euphoria yet though because after 5 years I still can’t transition at all…
That's great to know! \^ \^I would have experienced Euphoria from the sports bra I ordered... if it wasn't so small for me🙃
Ahh screams, yes! You dont even need to want to change your body to be trans, just be you 💞 you're amazing, if yera trans dude but atill wanna rock this tibbies? Frikennrock those tibbies you look fantastic ! If yer a trans women but dont wanna part with yer epic peepee? Then don't ! Keep the shlong, it makes you happy so who cares what others think?
Hecc even if you tuly identify as an airplane or tree, go ahead ! Just recognize you are in a human body and don't hurt yourself and others! I love you all bishes.
I always feel so happy for people who don’t experience dysphoria but also a little jealous. I wish I only had euphoria but instead it’s a rare experience 😔
I have an amazing little skip in my chest every time someone addresses me as ""they"". It's a great indicator indeed.
I'm not sure if it's considered having dysphoria, but I had the longest time this obsession to be ""normal"". Then realized that my normal is being nonbinary asexual and wow! The euphoria just keeps overflowing. 😄✌️
For me, I didn’t necessarily feel dysphoric when presenting fully masculine (i.e. suits are swag as hell) but my distress stemmed from feeling unable to express my femininity.

I still consider myself to have dysphoria, but I suppose it may be more accurate to say I hate the limitations that maleness placed on acceptable sources of euphoria.
I made a whole podcast episode about this and why my partner (a trans woman) and I (enby, genderfluid) think this should be the norm!! I'll link incase you want to listen, but I couldn't agree more with what you're saying!!

I love this! Each individual's story is unique and personal to them. You do not have to check off any specific box to be who you are! This is a wonderfully positive message :)

For anyone who does struggle with dysphoria and is needing some help, I just finished reading this and it was quite an excellent little short read!

I'm asking myself if I can get a mastectomy, even if I don't feel that strong disphoria. It would just feel better...
non-binary people are trans people! 💕
As someone currently attempting to Figure Things Out^(TM), I found this really helpful... Thank you for sharing!
Bro why would anyone put themself through the stress of dealing with doctors and insurance and becoming broke and coming out to family and going through medical treatment if they weren’t experiencing dysphoria?
[removed]
Is there some symbolism with the lack of neck stitching stuff on the 4th panel, like them feeling more connected to themself and their body by having the confidence and will to determine their own identity, or was it just an accident? Either way, death of the author. Good touch.
I am not trying to attack anyone but if you don't have gender dysphoria and you're happy with your gender why promote change?
I sadly know exactly what you mean…. I feel the same even tho an a much less big scale, i wish you best of luck that it soon gets better and you can feel more comfortable!
Same! I spent 30 years either not noticing or not experiencing dysphoria, and it's only as I began to experience gender euphoria that the dysphoria has started to rear up.
I’ve been feeling like I might be a man for years, but the dysphoria hurt so much when I started actually exploring my gender, that I just started suppressing it by going back to being a “woman” for a couple years. It’s coming back though and now I don’t know what to do because I can’t tell if I’m male or nonbinary. I’d prefer living as a man and identifying as such but I can’t find a way to tell if I actually *am* one.
Same here! Figured out I'm nonbinary and didn't think I'd have to change pronouns but the longer time goes and the more I peel back the layers that were covering up, well, me, the more I began to really have a distain toward things that hadn't bothered me.
I'd always hated my chest but thought that's because they're H at this point and that's freaking ridiculous... never really thought of that as disphoria but shit I guess it might be.. excuse me while I spiral for a bit
Me to my therapist: “Well, I don’t really experience dysphoria. I just feel like the way I see myself and my gender and the way society sees me don’t match up and it’s really frustrating.”

My therapist: “Well, that is gender dysphoria.”

Me: “Ohhhhh...”
Damn while I knew on some level that my extensive depersonalization was related to my immense dysphoria, I never gave it any thought as I didn't see the point. This was an interesting read to say the least.
Thank you so much for sharing this! I was positive I was going to read that thread and not relate to any of the experiences that were talked about but almost every single one hit me like a freight train. Things I was doing since I was a CHILD were mentioned there as signs of possibly being trans and I think I'm starting to question how much of myself is identifying as nonbinary but might actually be full on trans. Its extremely scared on one hand. I cannot possibly ever get the necessary help I need if I am, I am financially broke and I do not live in a location surrounded by people who would be supportive, and I fear I never will anytime soon. But on the other, I'm finally beginning to understand myself, and all I want in life is to find out who I am and love myself for it.
Thank you so much for this. I'm not crying. Okay I'm crying.
Just say no your dysphoria can’t legally harm you without consent! Just threaten it with a lawyer!
Thank God it's an ""Ex""
Yes that is totally right, there is no one indicator that everyone needs to have
Social dysphoria is where most of my dysphoria comes from, too. Being perceived as a woman based on the body I have seriously fucks with me. My new name and pronouns helped a *lot*, and I’ve had my hair short for like 8 years, even before I truly cracked and came out lol
Exactly. I’m a trans man and I recently decided I won’t be medically transitioning with hormones. I’ll get top surgery for my own comfort but I’m technically choosing to go back in the closet for future interactions even though I’ve been out socially for over five years.

My decision has been a drastically odd one in my community - I am going to stick out like a sore thumb. And I don’t care.

My dysphoria is still present, but I personally have learned I would rather manage it with a combination of good mental health practices and exercise than be visibly trans. My reasons are inherently selfish but that’s my prerogative. I don’t want to be a target, I want to travel all over the world with no issues, and I don’t want to be beholden to hormones for my entire life.

Dysphoria is so varied and how it is managed is varied too. I was convinced for 5 years the only way to treat my dysphoria was to medically transition. I still think for the vast majority of binary trans people that is the best option. But not for me. 

I wish I had realised I don’t need to tell everyone about my gender earlier. I felt for so long that I was being dishonest by not telling people I was trans, so I forced myself out of the closet way before I was ready.

Now I am going back in, and I’m staying there except for with a few close friends and family. I don’t feel everyone is entitled to know my gender just by looking at me. It’s private. They can address me as a woman and she/her and it won’t change who I am. 

I’m happy to be at this point but I know everyone’s dysphoria tolerance level is different and so I would never offer this up as a prescriptive “quick fix”. 

I hope people learn that dysphoria is hugely varied and what it means to an individual is just that - individual and wholly unique.
I get that people keep saying ""dysphoria is diverse"" which is true ofc but let people say how they feel in the ways they want to.
Exactly this! You don’t have to feel horrible about who you are right now to know that you would be much happier Beeing someone else! Happy for you that you found out who you really are!
Yeah, this is why the phrasing of ""you don't need dysphoria"" can be confusing. 

You need either dysphoria or euphoria to be trans. Most people experience both in some capacity. However, either one may go unnoticed or unrecognized. Therefore, if you do not notice dysphoria for any reason, but do notice euphoria, you may be trans. If you notice dysphoria, but don't notice euphoria for any reason, you may be trans. If you don't have either, you're probably not trans.
For the first time I hear someone saying you don't need euphoria too. I doubt a lot and lack of prominent burst of happiness euphoria and clear dysphoria makes it so hard for me
I never understood this, but as it's recently been explained to me:

All trans people experience dysphoria in some form, however, dysphoria is sometimes undetectable. The person might not recognize what it is, it might be covered up or meshed in with other body image issues, or it might not be noticeable when compared to other emotional/mental health problems. Therefore, while dysphoria can be an indicator that you are trans, it is not the only indicator, nor the most reliable one.

For me, my dysphoria has been very obvious to me since I was a child, even before I had the vocabulary or knowledge to describe what being transgender meant. I've also experienced very few emotional/mental health trials outside of experiences related to being trans. So I never understood how someone could ""not have"" dysphoria.
I think people use the term gender incongruence for that, but i may be wrong. Not my first language sorry
It also depends what you see as feeling bad enough to be real dysphoria,I often spiral into doubt and avoid saying thst I have dysphoria same with euphoria I can be happy for something but because it isn't the big big happiness I feel like it isn't what it is supposed to be
Sending love 💕
Screw this imma come out
Update: I'm still closted, my mom didn't understand it and if she does then she's ignoring it
You don’t have to feel horrible in you body to know that you feel better as someone with another sex so you can be just ok with your body but wanting to have the body of a boy instead
Oh how I hate medical staff who are like this…. If you don’t want to help people who suffer you should have picked a different job….
I think if there is norm people will spiral in doubt no matter the norm. Not having euphoria also can make you doubt especially if you expect the magical I know it /this is right moment and it never comes
It depends, I see myself as trans and non binary what is with the definition of the word completely right but not every non binary person wants to see themself as trans
Medical transition doesn't equal being nonbinary or trans. This post is about the identity, not the process of transition. They are not synonymous and you can be nonbinary or binary trans without medically transitioning.
Nah this isn't it
Don’t having dysphoria don’t mean beeing happy with your gender
Because while wearing a burlap sack is ok, wearing a cotton outfit is infinitely better
Wow another late comer. I’m 40 and am just figuring it out. It’s a mindfuck. Of course you add everything up and can’t believe that you can’t see it. No CIs males don’t fantasy they are a woman every night with a name and picture in their mind all their lives just to fall asleep. No boys don’t think about how an accident could happen to their genitalia that would force a doctor to make them a girl. It’s like 2+2=4 not 7. And I’ve been saying it’s 7 all my life and if you said it wasn’t then I was going to change my behavior whether conscious or unconscious to conform. Society fucks us up big time.
The beauty of this life, if you're safe to do so, you can explore! Try the pronouns on for size around safe and trusted people in your life. We can always change our minds, exploring your gender doesn't always need confidence to jumping from one side to the other, though that is also a ok if it feels right to you:) 
I just want to repeat, we can change our minds and there is no shame or harm in that. 
What was it that hurt about exploring your gender in the past? Feel free to msg
Me too!
[deleted]
woah thank you for this. I've been dancing around exactly that thought for weeks now. Reading this made me surprisingly burst into tears. Thanks :)
I feel this way but my imposter syndrome says that all cis women feel this way because of misogny or whatever. I don't actually think I feel this way because of that, my social dysphoria is about being straight up seen as a woman at all because I'm agender and hate being seen as gendered in any way. It's distressing to even see people suggest 'female' has to equal woman or to group me with women. But of course my brain is like 'But! But! But!'. Tiring. It's like my brain can accept every other trans person's identification of their own experiences as dysphoria, but with me, it *has* to be something else, it *can't* be dysphoria, it's almost like it's not allowed to be. Very frustrating. I'm tired of my brain.
Good idea! Lemme teach that fucker a lesson!
Ace Attorney: the Dysphoric Turnabout
In fact, I dumped her before that week ended. After that non-discussion, we ended up getting in a huge fight a few days later over something unrelated and I decided to walk away.
“Social dysphoria” is a great way to describe it. I feel fine with my body, but not the way my body lines up with my socialization. 

And just to be totally clear, there’s no WRONG way to be trans or nonbinary and no wrong way to find that identity! No one is more or less valid based on their reasons for their identity or presentation!
Reading this actually made me feel a bit better because I live in a context where I can't be out and likely can't medically transition even if I wanted to. Seeing other options that still involve me being who I am and sharing that with the people that are important but also managing my dysphoria and identity in other ways is very helpful. I used to think the only choice I had was deny my identity entirely.

I also think this is helpful for nonbinary folks with dysphoria that can't be helped by medical transition (because most transition makes you masculine or feminine, and if that isn't your identity, then what? I'm agender, there are no surgeries to make me pass as agender). And also enbies who will never be correctly gendered by strangers because they can't 'pass' as not a man or woman (most people don't even knowing being nonbinary exists, so there is no passing for most of us, especially those of us who aren't transfemme or transmasc and wouldn't be happy passing as binary genders). I wish this was talked about more. I need to learn to cope with social dysphoria because I'm never going to pass as my actual gender. I understand the trans communities focus on medical transition because it's what most trans people need, but there need to be discussions about others ways to cope for those of us whom transition won't work for.
I think your final statement sums it all up. Our identities are a spectrum, and our needs and expressions related to our identities evolve over time. The only thing we HAVE to be is ourselves, however we wish to do so, whatever that means for each person.

I stated this in another comment, but what is important to me most of all is that trans people deserve access to any kind of identity affirming care we need, be it medical transition, HRT, legal transition, trans-affirming counseling, down to safe and independent housing, as a matter of human rights.

Which aspects of that we all need and wish to take part in comes down to the individual, but the access to care ought to be universal.
mhm! and if u notice one, u definitely Have the other as well even if u can't recognize it.
It's also prescriptive to say ""all trans people experience dysphoria"". Even if true in whatever way, people should be able to express their own experiences in their own way. I don't have dysphoria even if people say ""I have to"" and explain whatever I'm feeling as dysphoria. It doesn't bother me but I know it does bother others, if that makes sense.
No you’re right, people do use that word for that. What I meant to say is when people say dysphoria, they usually mean gender incongruence
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ proud of you
That is totally fair!! I just think euphoria is a more widely held experience among the trans/gender expansive community, and just a less medicalized & less painful metric to focus on if we have to focus on something. However, I absolutely agree with you - at the end of the day, a person is trans if they identity as trans regardless of ANY other metrics :)

I have had some sort of facial hair for a large part of my adult life. At this point however, I want to claw any hint of shadow out of my face. It's weird, but I actually feel a direction now, and I care about myself so much more.
> Of course you add everything up and can’t believe that you can’t see it.

Just want to note for the benefit anyone questioning that this is not always the case.
Sometimes you don't have memories that provide clues that you're trans.
Definitely an egg cracking moment for me lmfao. 

I would sit there thinking “Wow it seems so freeing to be nonbinary, that just makes so much sense and I really relate to how nonbinary people seem to feel. Too bad I am cis!” without just... taking that one step of realization.
I believe if you are seeking medical transition or hormone therapy, the focus will be on physical dysphoria for which HRT or medical transition is an effective and appropriate treatment, so if that is why you were visiting that psychologist, that may be why they focused specifically on parsing whether you experience dysphoria for which HRT or medical transition is an effective treatment.

If not, it could be the case that, because you are seeking a medical waiver of some kind, the doctor is employing a much stricter view of the concept of “dysphoria” in order to limit the number of medical waivers granted for these reasons.

Or they could just be a doctor with a particularly limited view of what it means to be trans or nonbinary based on transmedicalist ideas. 

Either way, social dysphoria (as someone in another comment aptly referred to it) is very real, and doesn’t always overlap with physical dysphoria. But it also may be treated through methods other than HRT or medical transition, which may not be an appropriate treatment for people experiencing social dysphoria.

That said, I believe people know what they want, and who they want to be, and I trust any trans person’s view of themself and their needs.

eta: why would I be downvoted? I don’t know this person’s experience or story, which is why I spoke in general terms about why we may have had different experiences with different doctors, and why different doctors may take differing views, which seemed like what was in question.
I hope they are relieved or happy tears! I had a similar moment when I got this message. I hope the next steps of your journey are beautiful and affirming!
The idea of “imposter syndrome” is totally relatable to me. I had this thought process like, “Yes, I am dissatisfied with the perception of my gender by society, and I feel distress over the implications and expectations my gendered socialization has placed on me because of my body, but I would KNOW if I was trans and nonbinary, so because I’m only questioning, that can’t be me.”

Of course, the idea that trans and nonbinary people inherently know their identity and don’t go through long, always evolving periods of questioning is totally a fallacy on my part, a thought I gave myself to compartmentalize the challenges I knew I would (and have) face in confronting the part of me that had been questioning for so long.

I feel very thankful that I have a therapist that I got comfortable with through treating my anxiety and other stuff that I was eventually able to bring it up and work through it in a positive, trans-affirming way. I know most folks don’t have access to resources like that but I wish so bad that everyone did.
my trans phoenix headcanon is quaking
I totally get you and have solidarity with you. A big part of my decision was feeling distanced from cis men, and that my identity as a man wasn’t the same as theirs. It’s why I’m in this sub and have even told some people I’m nonbinary to make it easier for them to “deal with me”. 

Gender is so complex. I can’t fully ever imagine being able to look and be recognised as who I am in my mind. So I am settling for something simpler. 

There is a rhetoric of bravery regarding medical transition and visible transness in our communities and whilst I think that narrative is useful, it’s not prescriptive and we can’t all be beholden to it. I’m not less brave because I chose not to transition with testosterone. I’m not less trans because I don’t come out. 

I know much of our discourse is, as you said, centred around progression and ensuring trans healthcare is even available in its most basic sense. But I wish we could talk as a community more openly about other options without being shot down, or even worse shoved into the same corner as terfs. 

Like, dude. I’m from the UK. It’s basically TERF island. I know my view on “accepting my body” is drastically more complex than the average “adult female human” believes it to be. 

I want my voice and others like mine amplified too, so these people don’t end up painting trans people in two camps - medically transitioned and “detransitioned because they got it wrong.” 

It’s not the case. Our choices and experiences are so complex.
Yeah definitely depends on who youre talking to. But i agree :)
Thank you! My mom just said ""thanks"" lol
I have big problem with that both sides I overanalyze them and spiral into medicalist thinking
What do you mean it makes cis people get dysphoria? GNC people who are transitioning aren't cis by definition (unless they choose to identify that way which is also ok) but are also entitled to hormonal therapy? Policing someone's gender/gender expression is the dangerous thing here.
I can relate to this *so* much.

I, too, wore a beard from adolescence until the end of last year. I hated my chin, and the beard helped hide it. Nevermind that it made me look **more** masculine, I just didn't care enough to shave it and doing nothing was easy. 

Before allowing myself to come to terms with the notion that I'm trans, I just sort of... Coasted through life, doing the bare minimum, playing it safe. Since my egg cracked, I've been paying so much attention to my health - I'm dieting (properly), taking care of my skin and hair, and cut out alcohol abuse. Working on quitting smoking next. 

Discovering who you are gives you a purpose and the resolve to meet your destiny head-on, and I couldn't be more excited.
I get this!  Shave it. You will feel better. I did this weekend.
This makes me think of the way Daniel Lavery has written about the time before he started to transition, which really hit home for me: “I wish I were trans, then I could transition! But since I’m not, I guess I’ll just have to keep THINKING about transition all the time, without actually doing anything.” y’all: if you think all the time that you’d really love to be trans, nonbinary, etc. — congrats, you can be, and very likely already are!
I had my first gender-affirming therapy Appt last week, he said “well you seem really all over the place, and I haven’t heard you just SAY that you’re non-binary. If you could just take away all the guilt and external factors, how would you like to present?” 
And I’m like “uhhhh... like this. I’m still having a hard time understanding it myself, I can’t think of any other way to be.”
Big think lol
I think im having a realization
[deleted]
BTW, I should have clarified that there is a big issue with medical professionals not trusting trans people to know what our own needs are and what care will alleviate our dysphoria/activate our euphoria. 

I believe trans people are our own best judges of the care we need, and I believe HRT, medical transition, legal transition, trans-affirming counseling, and all other resources people need to live as themselves down to safe housing, should be available to everyone as a matter of human rights.
>I had this thought process like, “Yes, I am dissatisfied with the perception of my gender by society, and I feel distress over the implications and expectations my gendered socialization has placed on me because of my body, but I would KNOW if I was trans and nonbinary, so because I’m only questioning, that can’t be me.”

This is spot on how I feel. Like exactly.

And yeah, I really wish had a trans friendly therapist to work through this with. I have what I'm pretty sure is depression, or *some* other mental fuckery that makes me pretty nonfunctional, but I'm not sure I can get it treated any time soon. There's also gender stuff tangled up in there but there are no gender therapists in my country to my knowledge, and I don't know if I'd ever find a trans friendly one. Even gender euphoria is hard to feel in a prolonged way because ~depression~. Saps the joy out of you and all that. But I'm glad at least some people have access to that and to some kind of understanding and validation.
Yeah that can be so tough :( We deal with so much medicalist thinking from the outside, especially as many (but not all) trans & gender expansive folx HAVE to interact with the medical system (ie to medically transition). So we hear all of this medicalized diagnosing and gatekeeping and judging and UGH, it can absolutely become internalized. I'm sorry you struggle with spiraling into that, and I'm extra sorry our stupid society put it in your head in the first place. Again, all that is required to be trans is to identify as such - you are so valid!! ❤️
[removed]
I already have, plus more. Once HRT starts the hair will hopefully get finer and reduce the effort needed.
Ahhh, that is so relatable! 

The number one thing therapy has helped me with is understanding that there is no “right” way to be nonbinary or trans, and that many nonbinary and trans people go through evolutions of identity and terminology as we discover ourselves, and that’s totally valid and ok! Being tied to one identity or concept of identity that can never evolve or change is a cis thing. By understanding we are not cis, we free ourselves of those rigid structures and make room to experiment, experience things, and discover our true identities.

I hope your journey is fulfilling and affirming, even when it is hard!!!
Yes, a definite brain genius moment on my part : )

Tbh I really had to have someone help me answer the questions I had to know if I was REALLY feeling the things I felt and not like imagining them, as weird as that sounds!
Right on. I hope my language was clear that I wasn’t assuming where you are at or want to go in your transition : )

I hope you’re able to get the care you’re seeking through the VA!
I am sorry that the care that would help you is so out of reach. 

I am absolutely not any kind of therapist or counselor, but if you ever just need someone to talk to or commiserate with that has been on the same journey, please feel free to DM me. The least I can do is lend an ear : )
Can we chat ? You sound like so nice person
That sounds like you're talking about ""detransitioning"" which is an argument made by anti-trans people in order to delegitimize trans people. People don't transition for the heck of it, they do so because they want to. 

Your arguments are just garbage at this point so I'm disengaging.
Ahh further along then me. HRT is likely a ways off. But who know. It’s all moved so fast in my mind since coming out to my wife and a couple friends. I don’t really like this skin I wear either.
Absolutely! I'm always happy to chat :)

Bold of you to assume I'm downvoting when you have multiple downvotes lmao.

I am non-binary and well versed in transphobic arguments, this being one. It also perpetuating truscum discourse, which is gatekeeping grossness.

If anybody is trying to make tomboys and GNC people transition against their will, that too is oppressive, but you're getting mad at the wrong crowd for the wrong reasons. Maybe try and reflect on why your comments are getting downvoted. There isn't one way to be trans. ""Cis people transitioning"" and ""regretting it"" is like, such a prominent transphobic argument so it's sickening you're trying to use it here 

I said I was done before but this is just gross discourse you're using now"	nu7pf4	NonBinary	2688	0.99	2021-06-07 08:49:14

So much of our lives have unexpected parallels that we didn’t know AT ALL when we first got together! It’s definitely nice being with someone who fully gets you :)
Aww thanks! Being so involved in academia for my PhD and interacting with younger NBs helped me so much. It’s a difficult path but in my opinion very rewarding to complete your own project from scratch!
Thank you!!
Theythren is SO great! Happy pride
That’s amazing! In my opinion there’s nothing more important in a relationship than being seen, respected, and valued/cherished!

Homophobic dad, my secret pride flag		"This is GORGEOUS. Oh wow. I love it. I'm sorry your dad isn't accepting.
Is this custom made or can I get this? It’s absolutely beautiful
Are you nb and bi?
Great idea, also cool AF
this looks so cool! sending you strength <3
That looks absolutely stunning. Last month, I had to just draw something on the computer because since I'm taking classes online, my digital media teacher just wanted to know if everyone can use a computer and if they can draw on it.

I drew a purple sunrise from my window but then I realized that the sunrise was in the same colors as the non-binary pride flag. I guess my pride had subconsciously made its way into my art.

Here's a link. [It's on LGBT Amino. =/](http://aminoapps.com/p/szwn8z)
It looks amazing! Sorry about your dad tho, I'm your new parent now
enbi gang rise up

Yo this is dope
This looks super awesome!!
Did the same thing with my pan, nonbinary, and polyamory flag
I'll fight your dad, and your flag looks amazing!
How did you make this?? It’s amazing!!
Wow I would love a print of this! Absolutely stunning!!
stonks !!!!!!!!
This looks amazing!
oh wow i would looove to have one like that one my wall or something!
This is so cool, I love the idea
Omg that is gorgeous
That looks awesome! Your art work is amazing! I am sorry about your dad.
This is amazing! Great job! Once I get more financially stable, I would totally commission one from you, if you're up for it!
Yep if I could buy one of these I would immediately
You made that?! Damn you have talent. It’s lovely!
This is beyond science
Beautiful
Love it!!!
Love it. I want to do something like this too. Since my family's religious, it's the least I can do to try to maintain my sanity
It’s beautiful!! I love it!
I can relate, I have a tattoo that I put the colors of the bisexual pride flag. My parents know nothing about the meaning of different pride flags. They just think I love the colors.
I've done something so similar in my art class last year. Sweet, though!
This is absolitely fucking beautiful!
I am loving this art! It’s absolutely lovely to look at!
That is both gorgeous and clever!~<3
I am glad it is manageable.
WOW! please post this in r/LGBTart and r/lgbtmuseum
I love this!

It reminds me a lot of the Terraria Lunar Events.

Woo! I love people who defy homophobic assholes like this!

Religion is not a valid excuse to be a bigot
Yay! I'm happy to see other bi-nb people here! :)
you could say you’re NBi !
Me Too!
haha i love that
True, it's borderline a christian cult
Heey, im nb and bi too :)
Hey friendo, I'm NB and Bi :) It is nice to see others as well
Yay hello comrade!
Checking in!
nonBInary is my favorite
Mormon?
I'm...   it's complicated, but I'm NB-bi too. :)
no, typically called 2 by 2. you can look it up and there's a subreddit for it, Australia 60 minutes did an episode about it called the lying truth or the church with no name or something

"Me: ""I'm very subtle about my sexual orientation and gender identity."" Also me: *pride shoelaces go brr*"		"Omg those are so good & also the exact way Id expose my orientation (also those are my flags too  🤝)
Yoooo, they're so cool!!!! Did you get them from somewhere or make them?!?!?! These are my exact flags too
*waves at you w/ pan / enby solidarity* 
 
:D
 
very pretty!!!
Oh me goooosh, we share the same flags!
I wear a rainbow mask and have two different pronoun pins attached to my jacket lol 

I wanna get even more, like an ace ring and something for me being a lesbian
Hey, I like your shoelaces 👀
Dude, I JUST got both of these!!
Guuuh they're so fucking cute
Omg. I need to get those, i got rainbow laces from wish but they where not the greatest quality.
woah, where did you get these? i want them too
omg where the same
I have converse shoes and I put pride flags on the little bits on the toes. It’s funny I put the same flags on and on the same shoes.
if they had the asexual flag would they be shoe aces?
omg I adore this
clown shoes?
I'm convinced that pride shoelaces are the pinnacle of gender
Is nobody else gonna ask why they look like clown shoes?
Those are class 👊
HA Ha Ha, I can relate as well XD.
those are so cute!
love these!!
These are soooo so pretty!  I’m guessing these are from Etsy or somewhere? They have tons of cute Pride accessories. Admittedly I too try to be super subtle about “pride-signaling” (lol) out of safety, usually just with flags that most people wouldn’t recognize.

For example, I found these cute enamel pins on Etsy that are desserts based off various Pride flags. I bought three that fit my identity/orientation I don’t think any patron who wasn’t also LGBTQ noticed them. https://www.etsy.com/listing/550861186/pastry-pride-enamel-pins-sets-individual?ref=shop_home_active_4
My child will want those shoelaces. I hope there’s a link lol
I need these ! 
Where did you find it ?
Omg I wanna buy the enby ones
Yeaaahhh!!!
Enby pans, untie!

...I mean, UNITE!
OMG YESSS!!!!
Also I need that as well like really bad
You’re just like me
Okay. Those shoes look really comfy. Please tell me what they are. O.O
This literally screams ‘gender is but a social construct’ lol
Those are great!!
I got these flags as keychains on my backpack! Cool to see you!
Oh awesome! I have a bunch of pride items, but I never thought about shoe laces. I'll definitely check out the links you posted in the replies, since I too am enby pan, also vegan (cool shoes BTW.)
We share the same flags
Nothing about these shoes or laces is subtle about your gender or sexual identity.
My 1st thought: clown shoes
I need these
Welcome to the club!   
Nobody in my country probably knows the flags, except the people that have these flags, so not exposed. :D
Mine too!
Same flags tooo 💟
Nonbinary pansexual here too!
They're from etsy. Just search for -whatever lgbtqia+ term- pride shoelaces on there.
*\*Waves back\**

Thank u.
That's cool!
op stole them from the president
Thank u.
I've got them from etsy. :D
Etsy, just search for -lgbtqia+ term you want the flag of- pride shoelaces.
Thank u.
Nope?
Agreeable. -And oversized hoodies.-
Someone already asked. These are barefoot shoes (simulate barefoot walk that is proven to be healthier for feet if you have correct way of walking), so they have more space for toes, otherwise it would defy the purpose.
Yeah, they are from etsy. *I've written that in responses like 20 times already.* :D

I love pins, but I don't have where to put them, so I rather buy clothes nobody's gonna get if I'm not out to them.

Etsy, there's somewhere link in the comments replies. But you can just search up ""nonbinary/pansexual pride shoelaces"".
There's somewhere link in a comment response, so you can check it out.
I've got them from etsy. Pride shoelaces, if you wanna check.
Does that mean we're sibs now? :D
It's Ahinsa vegan-leather barefoot shoes and the shoelaces are from etsy.
Some kind of barefoot shoe I think - maybe Vivobarefoot - and I want them and the laces, those are my flags too.
Thank u.
Yeah... that's... kinda the point of the joke I made?
They are barefoot shoes. They stimulate barefoot walking without having to make your legs dirty.
Haha, Ive been in the club for the past decade! ✨And yeah I feel ya. Country Im originally from (but not residing in now) is the same. It is in fact dangerous to be recognized as queer over there.
ayy same flags here too
Hooray for nb pans ✨🤝
Which president? :D
Finally the response I'm looking for 👀
Boooooooo
the wide toe made me think of clown shoes
Thanks !
Yeah
Nice! 🤘 The material looks pretty flexible, are they comfy? Hello fellow vegan pan enby! ☺️ Currently rocking vegan barefoot five-toe Vibrams, sooo comfy. ✊
Nice! They all look really great - how to choose?  Hmm...
They're Ahinsa brand and the laces are from etsy.
You're very welcome. 👍
Oh nice
Sounds like my country's eastern neighborhood.
🖖🏽
That makes sense. They're barefoot shoes, so they wouldn't have that effect if they were narrower.
They are the comfiest I've ever had if I don't count actually walking without shoes. :D Glad to find a fellow vegan pan enby here!
ohhhh i’ve never heard of those
Welp, now you have. :D
I’ve been wearing barefoot shoes daily for 2 years now and I absolutely love them! What company are those from?
Ahinsa, they make awesome and very comfortable vegan-leather shoes.

I crocheted myself a pride tank top. :)		"Enby crocheter’s unite🙌

This is wonderful. I love it!
Wow this is really great work!!
It's so cute!! You look amazing in it!!
Lovely! 💞
Skills! Deeply impressed, lovely work💜

No you can ask people why they’re staring at your croch.
Not just the top is beautiful, the whole person is beautiful!
Nice
Yesssss I love seeing all the other non-binary crocheters on here! I also adore the colours you chose, they work so well together - would love a jumper in these colours! (not brave enough for the guns out look 🤣)
omg!!! Just seen your etsy, wish I could crochet so I could use your patterns 😭
My jaw literally dropped, that is so cool
I love it!
hehe cool !
This is cute and you are cute ☺️
Ahhhh I love it!
I want it 🥲
One of the other NBs at my work made a pride beanie. It’s awesome. Also it’s really wild that there are three of us NBs that work there. It’s really nice actually.
That looks rad!!  I’ve never seen a crocheted tank before. 

I just got a NB pride button and I can’t wait to rep it at work tomorrow.
Omg need to learn to crochet asap, this is amazing and you look awesome!
I love this so much that I am going to start crocheting. ❤️ Any tips on starting out?
So cute! Goes perfectly with your half sleeve tattoo 😊
Take my money!!! I'll buy 3
ooo epiccc
It looks great, your so talented.
Omg you are cute as hell 😍 and I want that tank top!! Such an epic look!

Yay!! Omg I'd love to see some of your work sometime!

Oh wow 🥺 thank you so much for saying that.
Thank you! ☺️
Yeah, the pattern's up on my Etsy! It's all silt stitch

www.etsy.com/shop/finleycladdesigns
Thanks!! :D
I appreciate it ☺️
Thanks :) yeah I'm pretty psyched about my wardrobe at this point haha! Especially with the big project I have underway right now, it's really gonna round it out.

Ba dum tss ;)
Oh wow thank you 🥺
Yeah I'll admit I wasn't psyched to bring these flabby ole ""guns"" out haha, they're a work in progress... But hey it's getting warmer out there so figured I'd keep up with the times. Come winter time I'll certainly have so sweaters and such in enby colors :)
Aw thank you!! Never too late to learn, I only picked it up about 1.5 years ago and I'm head over heels haha :)
Oh wow, thank you haha!!! ☺️
Thank you POOPY_CHICKENS 💜
Wow that is pretty wild, I would love to be around other NBs that often. I'm the only one I know irl.
Ooh good luck with that! I just ordered my first ever pronouns pin, I'm pretty jazzed up too 😊
Oh wow seriously?? That's amazing! Crochet has been such an amazing thing in my life it psychs me up so much to hear other people want to try it out. I've been meaning to start a YouTube channel to do beginner tutorials but honestly I don't know a thing about YouTube. My biggest tip would be to learn by doing! Buy some real cheap yarn, maybe a little beginner's guide from whatever craft store you go to, and go at it. I remember for a couple days all I knew how to do was chain, so I just made yards and yards of chains. My first attempt at just a simple rectangle ended up being a weird trapezoid, so I tried again until I figured out what I had been doing wrong. Don't be afraid to waste yarn or expect things to look amazing right out of the gate- everybody starts somewhere, and that somewhere is probably gonna be a bunch of weird shapes all over your house haha.

Also, once you start reading patterns and start tackling actual projects, my advice is to go for stuff that truly interests you rather than just what you think you'll be able to accomplish. You'll have way more fun and learn a lot more by making a less-than-perfect version of something you think is really cool than you will making a very well executed but boring item that you'll never actually use/wear.

Oh, and google is your best friend. 💜
I'm sorry they're only currently available in multiples of 16

I make beaded earrings! Wearing things I have made myself make me feel really good.
You’re welcome! 😊
I crochet and I’m non-binary and I came here to ask if there’s a pattern - and there is! Thanks for writing it down!
I'm glad!! You deserve it! ❤️
Your quite welcome, also dope tattoo! 🤘🤘
So glad you decided to go for it though, you look great! 😃
I love some of the stuff on your shop. Would you mind if I sent you a message on Reddit if I have any questions?
Dang it, looks like I'll have 16 sweaters instead of 3
Oh that's so awesome! You're right, there's nothing quite like being able to express yourself by literally wearing your own art.
Of course!! Thanks for coming to ask :)
Thank you! ☺️
Absolutely not!! And genuinely, your comment has reignited my determination to start that YouTube channel, so I will most certainly let you know as soon as I get that up and running, I found YouTube really helpful in learning so I'm hoping I can contribute to that library.
Hey! So I went ahead and started that channel, please forgive my truly awful and boring YouTube skills, I'm sure over time I'll get better. But to start out I made three quick tutorials on kind of what I see as the first three steps to learning to crochet.

Here's the first:

All at once. It's mandatory.
You have great style Finley! I can see how happy your crocheted shirts make you. Keep doing you!

happy pride! unrelated but i have the exact same keychain lol
Cute!
Question: my first thought seeing this was ""you looking cute gurl"" but I'm not so sure how you feel about being called gurl. I'm coming up blank on substitutions for gurl. Any recommendations?

Edit: just realized I posted this in r/nonbinary (I followed from the popular tab), and I'm sure there's recommendations all over this sub. I'm going to peruse a bit to find some.

Feel free! The vibe is up for grabs
Unfortunately, no. Kinda wish I did though

Gotcha. The ""remove before flight"" keychain is what got me asking. I usually only see those with people who ride motorcycles, typically sports bikes. I have the same keychain, and I do ride. You should get into it, it's really fun!
mine too lol, the eyelet separating from the fabric right?

Hi Juni, I'm Juno
Nice to meet you Juni! Happy Pride 🌈☺️
Hey Juni!
Hey Juni! Nice to meet you, I’m Moss! 🌱
Hi Juni! Love the name and the style!
Happy pride Juni! You look amazing
Hi Juni! I hope you’re having a great day. Happy Pride Month!

(I would introduce myself but I haven’t picked a name yet :,) )
Nice name Juni! Nice to meet you!
I love it!! Congrats :)
Hi juni!!
happy pride juni!
nice to meet you, Juni
Juni is a lovely name!! It suits you very well <3
What a great name!
Very sexy
Hi Juni 👋🏻☺️
Juni, your new name fits you so well 🙌🥰 Happy Pride.
Aww like spykids
Thank you 😊
Thank you 😄 loving your name as well
What are you a kingdom hearts character /s
Came here to say the same! Literally named by Pride month
The same goes for Dutch!
Hi Autumn, that's a lovely name 💜
I wanted to keep J as the first letter of my name and wanted to have a two syllable name to fit the even syllables from the rest of my names so I kept trying things that fit that criteria and landed on Juni.
Beautiful name btw🥰
Thank you 😁 and my name choice was completely unrelated.I picked Juni because it fit the criteria I came up with.
(I explained in response to another question: I wanted to keep J as the first letter of my name and wanted to have a two syllable name to fit the even syllables from the rest of my names so I kept trying things that fit that criteria and landed on Juni.)
Have you chosen a new name?
And the plan is to get hotter 😉 Thank you
Love your name, Moss 😁
YESSS SOMEONE KNOWS WHAT KH ISSSS
Ah okay! I just asked because Juni is straight up just the german word for June. 

I do also have a new name, and funnily enough I chose it without much consideration but it turns out that it’s coincidentally extremely fitting. My name now is Salt, with my middle name Leonard and both first and middle name actually ended up being the same amount of letters as they were in my deadname. 

Additionally, one of my favorite fictional characters is called Sallot Leon (excuse my spelling I have now idea what it’s spelled as) which is very similar and didn’t happen on purpose. They’re a non binary assassin from my absolute favorite book.

You're a DnD fan too? Ugh just take my heart 💛😂
And a D&D nerd?! That's whats up.

You look great!

Hell yeah, love your nails and shirt <33 your vibe is amazing!!!!

Cool shirt, cool nails, cool aes
Love your nail colors 😍
Love it!
omg d&d!! you're officially the best!
You look so nice (and cute)! And I adore the nailpolish, the colors match amazingly well.
What's your favorite class?
You look really badass.
love your nails and lipstick!!
You're so stylish! I love your shirt too!
On point!
D&d! My dude! That shirt is awesome!
I love your nails!
You should use a dark purple or dark red lipstick instead because that black looks really flat. Maybe with a black eyeliner or similarly colored eyeliner to the lipstick if you wear eyeliner.

But you're very attractive already, ngl, and lookin pretty androgynous.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
You and your nails are fabulous as all hell! Happy pride theybe <3
🖤🖤🖤
Oh shit, you are you me with better hair and a nice shirt? <3

Like everyone, I just have to compliment your shirt. D&D is aperently a game not just for nerds, but also queers, or maybe the queers are all nerds...
Superb 💕
Gasped aloud when I saw this. This is such a LOOK ! 😱💕
Thank you! I’ll keep that in mind
Loooove the shirt, love the whole look!
Thank you!

I got it from this store in a mall near lynnwood in Washington state. I can’t remember the name of the store though and thank you!! 💛🤍💜🖤
I usually was the DM but I played around with warlock and cleric! Though I’d like to play again I just haven’t been able to find people to play
I’m you from the parallel universe. And I usually DM but I really wanna play a genasi barbarian, fighter, or warlock. Been wanting to play around with some of the subclasses and UA subclasses that have been coming out
(Oh, I've just noticed the t-shirt-- yay for that queer DnD rep!)
Not an American, actually, I hope they make those at my country too, thanks anyway

Happy Pride :)		"i am looking respectfully 😳
You are beautiful!  That is a gorgeous beard and you are absolutely rocking it. Thanks so much for sharing!  🌈Happy Pride!
Looking good! Hope you have sunscreen 👍🏼
Fuck yeah ✊
Took me a while to realize the right half of your beard isn’t reeeeeeally long
Woah, boobs and beard? How? Tell me your secrets!
You look GLORIOUS, friend! :D
You look absolutely amazing!!!
Yes
Beard jealousy is a real thing, y’all!

Happy pride month, I hope your whole year feels you with euphoria!
Fucking stylish!!
That’s AWESOME❤️!! I have a lil crop of chin hairs, let them grow to see if they’d turn into anything worth having, but alas. Not enough rows of hair(sob)!!
Beards really aren't my thing, but shit this makes me want one all of a sudden
Love that joy on your face 😍
I've been blessed
That's almost identical to my own beard. Looks great!
Mutton chops and ponytail, what an asthetic!
You give me so much serotonin!! You look amazing! Happy pride!
I want to be you
Enjoy your day! N happy Pride 💘
Looking fantastic!
BEAUTIFUL. Queen slay. You are amazing
😍😍😍😍😍 You are magnificent. Happy and Powerful Pride to you!
Beautiful 😍
Your beard is majestic, you look awesome
Definitely looking respectfully
I’m not sure about OP, but I have PCOS and a symptom of it is hirsutism. I literally could grow a beard but I shave it because I’m too scared. OP is so confident, I’m honestly inspired. It looks so great!!
i know some folks can achieve this by HRT (testosterone gives you the beard, and you keep the already existing chest)
For some, prior to going on T, they use Minoxidil (aka Rogaine) on the areas they want hair.    

I'm going to try it on my brows. As I was around and plucking my brows in the 90's. Aka the period of time when pencil line brows were in. So we'll see how well it works.
I have a bit of patchy growth too, and I suspect PCOS because of my general tendency toward heavy periods. But it just won't grow long enough to be a proper beard. I've tried--it stays patchy like a thirteen-year-old's. Very annoying. I wish it would go one way or the other, either a proper beard and stache or nothing at all. But nope, nature forces me to shave, like it or not. At least I can complain about it here and not be thought of as ridiculous... I wonder if low-dose T would give me a proper beard? With my luck it would probably just give me more hair on my butt. :(
Ooh, yeah, I guess for AFAB people it might not be too hard. For AMAB people, maybe going on E, growing boobs, then going off it would result in this?
Just an idea, you could look into the minoxbeards subreddit
E doesn't get rid of pre-existing facial/body hair (otherwise transfem folk wouldn't be putting so much effort into hair removal). You could look like this doing puberty twice in either order. I think OP specifically is AFAB with hirsuitism though.
Beard keeps growing on E, no need to go off"	nry5bl	NonBinary	2148	1.0	2021-06-04 06:12:18
Self portrait I did for pride last year		"*Once upon a midnight dreary*

*An Enby made a portrait that was scary*

*But fear not due to their talent being merry*

*Such work was dreamy and brought joy, very*
This looks absolutely amazing!!!
Thats cool af. I really like the layering. Had a lot of depth.
This looks like it could be the cover for a graphic novel 💜
Seriously incredible-- not only in terms of your artistic skill, but the amazing unique creative composition of the image. Nicely done!!!
Bruhh you'd get full marks for my art class

This is a compliment of the highest order that shits hard and this shits good as fuck

This is amazing. Is it traditional or digitial?
God.. I feel this haaard
This is incredible!
This is insanely cool
How long did this take you! This looks amazing. As an artist myself. I'm curious of the time it took and what you used
Damn, this is incredible and clearly we have a ton in common. Do you sell prints, perchance?

I did nonbinary flag makeup, and went to Pride looking like an 80s drag king. Gender off the fucking charts!		"Woaaah, this is stunning! Your makeup is peak but also just the top makes it, love it
This is SO gender
Omg. This is amazing. What lipstick is that? Cuz I love it.
Simply En Fuego!!🔥🔥🔥
oh my god theres so much gender going on here. You look amazing
Goddamn the sheer amount of gender in this photo is off the fuckin charts
inCREDIBLE
Oh we ABSOLUTELY love it
That is very gender I love it
Very cool look! ☺️
i love this so so much holy
I absolutely love it! I might borrow your makeup idea for my own pride outfit! I hope you enjoyed pride
Can I ask if the mustache was makeup? If so, how did you achieve that look?
Hey! Leave some gender for the rest of us!
omg!! you look great!
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
that is so cool!
Monarch, thou art RADIANT!!! :D
I LOVE THIS!
Words can't express how much I love it!!!
ohhohohohohhoho i am JELLY
Perfect with your username too 😂
Wow that makeup is sooooo pretttyyyy
I am like, in shock rn. Your makeup is FLAWLESS!! LIKE YASSSSS!!! Not to mention you're pretty cute. 10/10 absolute win
I love the broach and it goes great with the chain necklace + eyeshadow

\*chef's kiss\*
You're killing this look!!
Goals. You look amazing!!!
is that DOUBLE DENIM i see???? yez
Awesome!! 🤩
yasss go get it love! I’m so proud of you💛🤍💜🖤
You look fuckin amazing!! ✨
Omg, can we get a product list?  Those eyeshadow colors are amazing and I need them!!
Reminds me of Kerry Eurodyne a bit!
Lipstick is a combo of the purple base, which is Ciate’s Glitter Flip liquid lipstick in ‘Iconic’, and the gold in the middle is Wet n’ Wild’s Perfect Pout lip color in ‘First Place Winner’.
Thank you! and it was sort of a combo- I have a small/light mustache naturally but I added eyebrow gel and a little bit of fiber mascara to make it more prominent.
Thank you so much!! Here's the product list:

For the eyeshadows: I used the Pür ‘Festival’ palette (for the purple, and the gold glitter), Violet Voss ‘Essentials’ palette (black, light gold highlight on lid), and the Ace Beauté ‘Nostalgia’ palette (warm gold inner corner and bright purple). I especially love the Nostalgia palette, it's super pigmented.  
For the eyeliner, I used the Stila waterproof liquid liner in black and the L'Oreal Infallible Paints in white. My mascara is tarté Big Ego and I used Colorpop brow boss gel on the eyebrows. I used that mascara and brow gel for the mustache as well. 

For the lips, I mentioned this above, but it's Ciaté Glitter Flip liquid lipstick in ‘Iconic’, and the gold in the middle is Wet n’ Wild’s Perfect Pout lip color in ‘First Place Winner’."	op5geu	NonBinary	1988	1.0	2021-07-22 03:10:58
Happy (end of) Pride Month!! 🌈		"When you're getting gender envy from all of them: *anxious sweating ,but dying of cuteness*
fuck i wish i had horns...
I love the art!!
Pride month never ends! (I'm extending pride forever)
low how all of them are just normal very gay humans but the asexual is just like fuck you i am tiefling
June's over, back into the closet with us. /s
I'm sad I couldn't celebrate it properly :(

i wish i could be out with the rest of everyone
The bisexual person’s phone isn’t clearly on 3% and I find that outrageous.
I ship it. All of it
Hi, I'm OP. I've never actually posted on Reddit before despite having this account for almost 6 years lol. I really didn't think this would get much attention, so I was surprised when I woke up this morning and saw the notifications. I wanna thank everyone for upvoting and commenting and the awards. I'm glad you all liked this piece as much as I do! :D

These fools my OCs, and they are all siblings. From left to right their names are: Dimitri, Juno, Eros, Theodore, & Lilia. There's actually one more of them, but he's cishet. His name is Apollo, and [he's the one taking the picture lol](https://twitter.com/trashprince8/status/1408550978740133890). We love a supportive family!! ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜

I'm not good at plugging myself, but um... if you want to see more of my art, you can find me on Twitter @ TrashPrince8 and Instagram @ Sinklair8

Anyway, thanks again, everyone. I hope you all had a happy and safe pride 🌈✨✨

*Edit: I forgot to say something lol*
*i'm in this picture and i like it so much*
Time for wrath month!
I feel like with these things you just can't not look for your flag
Are they original characters love the style
Their expressions are great.
Good, we can still be proud and the companies aren’t all “consume our product, homosexual.”
Omg I want Enby's skirt and Pan lmao
As an ace person I can confirm we have horns /j
They're so cuteeee!!! Omg! I'm part Juno and part Lilia 💗
RIGHT this is ridiculously cute and I wish I were any of them
same 😭😭😭😭 transition goal: tiefling
Same
In a perfect world I would be a satyr
Thank you!! <3
His name is Eros and he’s a special one for sure😔
I’m not fully out myself, so I understand the feeling of loneliness. But don’t worry. There will be other prides. Who knows? Maybe this time next you year you’ll be celebrating out and openly :>
Even the aro enby?
They are actually a queer band of siblings ^^
theyre all poly and in love.
Thank you very much!! <3 And yes! They are my original characters :D
No joke 😩 all the enbies wanna be Creatures
Transition goal: dragon. 
Heck I love dragons. ╥﹏╥
The ace is named Eros. That’s amazing lmao
aromantic people can still desire and be in relationships
Aw sh*t 😅

Happy Pride! r/NB, take some LGBT-Visors Mandos!		"this is the way.
If you wanna add more, try the lesbian and gay men flags!
Holy fuck this is so cool!
You have something I want.
Fun fact, all mandos are canonically non-binary as their traditional language mando’a has no pronouns or gendered language. For example Buir meant both ""mother"" and ""father"", just as ""son"" and ""daughter"" were both represented by the word ad. When it was necessary to specify gender, the adjectives of jagyc or dalyc—male and female, respectively—would be added.
What're the bottom 2?
Do you plan to sell stickers of these??
How can u include gender queer but not lesbian that's ridiculous
[deleted]
r/transclones
Awesome!!
This is the way
I must move to mandalore immediately
The yellow flag with the purple ring is the Intersex flag and the purple, green & white flag is the genderqueer flag
I post more often to twitter then anywhere else but youre welcome to download and print yourself
3-4 colour flag easy, multitone colour flag = new to make a new helmet for it to look nice
/j?
That's cuz they're complimentary colours. They look good together.
as always?
this is the way!
Cool! thanks!
I mean, like as a color scheme, I do personally find it to be really pleasing, arguably more than any of the other. Blue, pink and purple just go really well together

Liverpool Pride!		"It's been Pride this weekend here in Liverpool! Can't really do anything so I'm stayed in, being all Non-Binary, drinking and grooving out with some awesome tunes and my partner. We watched a Jinkx Monsoon online show too. Not the Pride season we imagined, but have fun all the same everybody! Keep on keeping on.
Where did you get that dress?!?!? Want! So good!
I love it! What a fun vibe. Definitely cheered me up ^_^
You. Look. *Fabulous*!!
I also live in the Merseyside area! Nice to see a fellow enby nearby!
I love this picture!
Ok this is just the cutest!
you are GORGEOUS!! 😍😍😍
Absolutely gorgeous.

Soooooo awesome!
Fabulous. 

This is all I can say. Just simply

You look gorgeous
You look absolutely stunning!!!
i LOVE. YOUR HAIR. AGH 😍😍

Loving fishnets and the enby flag dress.

Hell yes! <3
Happy pride from a neighbouring Manc! You look fabulous!

You're gorgeous
You are so gorgeous omg ❤️ I love your style, the combination of this outfit and your hair is perfect. Happy pride 🎉🏳️‍🌈
b just vibin is best pride
sounds super fun!
Aww, thank you all so much! It was from Redbubble. I don't usually go with an A-line but I got this for Pride last year so thought I'd bring it back to reminded me of a better time when we could actually go out!
I also need this.
Aww, thank you! I'm glad ♥️
Aww, that means a lot! I usually feel like a goblin, haha.
Awesome! Represent, haha ♥️
♥️♥️♥️
🐱

I wish! But thank you so much ❤️
Aww no, but thank you! I always hate how I look, haha ♥️♥️♥️
♥️♥️♥️

Far too kind!
♥️🖤♥️
Thank you! ♥️
Because you're far too sweet, clearly ♥️
Aww, no! But thank you muchly. I usually feel awful about myself so that helps a lot.
Thank you! ♥️♥️♥️
Isn't it a wonderful wig? I would wear it all the time if I didn't have to glue the sucker down, lol.
♥️♥️♥️
♥️♥️♥️

Fishnets for life
Hey hey! And thank you very much. I do always love going to Manchester.
Aww, thank you muchly! ♥️♥️♥️

Aww, thank you! You're far too sweet.
Avoid anything and everything I'm doing, haha.
Aww no, I'm something to avoid, haha. But thank you so much ❤️
Lies! Lies! But sweet lies ♥️
Doing it RIGHT.
It was fun, despite the lack of a parade or whatever! Lots of cool streaming stuff going on online.
A-line looks good on you!
Also need this!!!
I honestly get it bc I'm usually my worst critic but I mean it, absolutely breathtaking
I'm not kind enough. I hope am blessed to look as cute as you when I get where I wanna be physically
No, it’s because you have **STYLE**! And are definitely working it. That hair is some serious goals for me. You’ve got cute color and nice curls without the dried out mess I run into.  I’m currently rocking a messy bun that hasn’t been down in a few days. Detangling this is going to a fun time lol I have small bits of pink still in my hair from when I tried to go plum (instead went fuchsia 😂) but I had to shave most of the back off bc my hair for so fried from being so dry and curly. So, now I just admire curly hair that I hope to achieve but likely will never have the patience to deal with.
Oh a wig!! Haha I wish I could have that as my natural hair colour
No I love all of it
I'm not lying and nobody else in this comment thread is lying. You are absolutely gorgeous
Aww, well, thank you very much indeed! ♥️🖤♥️
Came here to ask the same
I usually look like a goblin, so this is a wonderful compliment!
Oh yes - I'm old and bald, haha. I miss having fun coloured hair like this.
♥️♥️♥️
Also same
Damn you do not look ""old"", except in the intellectual sense of the word. Also I am absolutely in tune with your flair 😍😂

Students who identify outside of male or female can not complete the housing application, despite freshmen being required to live in residence halls. This college prides itself on being inclusive.		"Do they have a diversity and inclusion director? I would message them directly.
The person you emailed probably has no power to fix it, I'd escalate to the DEI director like ultraspiral said.

Don't be afraid to raise a stink on social media or bring it to a reporter if you don't hear back in 24-48 hours, or if they make it your problem.

Your college likely has a newspaper, and I bet they'd love to do a story on this shit. If not, reach out to lgbtq media like [www.them.us](https://www.them.us) 

And if you live in a blue state which protects trans people, this could be a form of illegal gender identity based discrimination, though obs consult a lawyer.
What's the point of having the ""other"" option if that bars a student from living on campus?
Oh, yeah. How inclusive. ""You can pick male, female, or 'other', but if you choose the last, you'll be banned, because we're very inclusive""
If you’re comfortable enough to share the name of the college, even if just through a DM, I’d really appreciate it. I work at a high school as a college counselor and would love to make sure that this college isn’t visiting our school until this is fixed. Of course I totally understand if you’re not comfortable sharing.
“We allow you to choose rooms depending on how you identify, only if you identify binarily of course !”
lmfao dont fill it out! and when they give you attitude for it, bring it up the chain of command that you were discriminated in the housing app due to your gender. i doubt the dean will want that coming out ;)) dont do anything if youre being treated unjustly. you already took initiatve to message and were given a bs answer. what i said is exactly what i have done in the past. if its \*that\* important for freshman to live on campus, they need to accommodate you, or allow you to live off campus under special circumstances. sometimes you cant make a change by being nice. you could help all the future nonbinary people that enter too.
Isn’t this considered discrimination based on *Bostock v. Clayton County Holders*? I know that applies to Tile VII, but the rule is that “discrimination based on…sex…” means gender identity. I’m pretty certain they just admitted to illegal discrimination.

EDIT: Quick edit I wanted to say, if you can and want to consider it, I recommend getting a lawyer before changing anything. I kinda think you got a case here
Sometimes choosing “other” or “non-binary/agender” feels like nothing  but outing yourself on documents . . . I’m starting to lean just toward always checking “female” just to be safe.
Ugh.  How did they answer?
Their reply was (1) very specific & (2) completely useless

I'm sorry you have to put up with their nonsense
Because nonbinaries are gods, and we must be housed in temples.
How can they require you to live in the residence halls? How is that even enforced? That whole thing is just…. really weird. I’m genuinely really sorry
Gender segregation needs to end
My former employer has an LGBTQIA+ dorm building that seems to be an acceptable compromise for students.
If this is Georgia Tech (going based on them calling themselves Tech, email policy, Res Life name, and mention in another comment about the state's history of transphobic legislation), DM me and I'll get you connected with the right resources.
So, Wait, Are You Then Not Allowed To Be A Freshman If You're Non-Binary? That's Outrageous.

Honestly, I Don't Get Why They'd Need To Separate Them Based On Gender In The First Place. Just Feels Like Pointless Bureaucracy To Me.
If this is Tennessee Tech there is a chance if you elevate it to the right people you may get put in Tech Village.
Bring to the dean bro
Then why have ""other"" if you don't allow it? I don't get that one
Office of Equal Opportunity. Should have an access coordinator. Additionally, you may find help with the dean of students office or ombud. From someone who works in a reslife position at a state uni, you really gotta work the discrimination angle to make any progress. In the end, they'll likely say you'll have to pick one for logistics reasons, but you wont have to change how you list your identity
if the school has a good independent student newspaper, I would also get in touch with them in addition to what other commenters have suggested. I worked at a student newspaper in college and this is the exact kind of thing we would've wanted to write about. that can hopefully bring some local attention to the issue
Ok from what little I know about tech, emailing from an external email isn’t a huge issue. It’s not like you sent them some file to download, so that point is moot in my eyes. Also, yeah, if you really want to drive a truck through this, I’d reach out to local media.
This is ridiculous. I went to a big tech college, and they did not segregate dorms or floors by genders (and for roommates you got to choose which genders you were comfortable rooming with, and could choose any/all). Sorry you are dealing with this!!
Why the hell do they have a “other” option if you can’t fucking  pick it?
Sad. That isn't nice. I guess pick the gender you identify with most closely, or the one where you'll get less questions/harassment.
[Inspect element](https://twitter.com/manedpup/status/1393333634694881282) the application? 😈
Ok first of all, why have the ""other"" option then???
Second, this is transphobic and discriminating. Not allowed housing just cus you're out of the binary? What absolute bullcrap
Even the fact that the floors are separated by sex is stupid. Is having a neighbor of the opposite sex really that scandalous and despicable?
Well, in Eastern Europe, it applies for all dorms. You can only choose a room fit for your agab, only with similar people (eg. if your afab, you can only live with girls).
What's the point of having other on the application then?
The college I’m going to has a similar policy, but they asked for “whichever gender I feel most comfortable sharing a bathroom” and to speak with their housing director if I needed any additional accommodations due to my gender.
Theoretically, if there are not enough non-binary roommates, do you have a preference on which gender you would want to room with? I know it's imperfect, but picking that gender will get you the result you want in the end. It doesn't matter what your AGAB is.
Did they answer what you're meant to do?
In a co-ed dorm, there shouldn't be a problem.
Bruh
What the fucking point of having an ""other"" option then?

What a joke.

MAKE THE ""OTHER"" OPTION WORK, FOR FUCK'S SAKE. IT'S NOT JUST A FUCKING PREFERENCE.
My uni was the same way, the first time we filled out the application for dorms there wasn’t an “other option”. Now there is, but if we select it we can’t choose a dorm since they’re all gender specific (my roommate and I are both non-binary so the frustration is shared)
Whoever this person is that responded doesn’t seem to understand what you’re asking, or does but doesn’t believe that there are more than two genders. Damn. 

First, so sorry you’re dealing with this right now. Starting college is already overwhelming, you have to learn so much about financial aid, choosing classes, etc. then to throw this blatant discrimination on top?? 

Second, as others have said you absolutely have a case here. I hope you can find the energy to reach out for help on this to take these mfs down. Finding a professor or instructor to take your side could be a great start because they might be able to do a lot of the difficult work for you (reaching out to orgs or people in power, advocating on your behalf to higher ups, etc)
My work, at the largest university in my state, has locker rooms and absolutely no NB option. We're more inclusive than others in that locker rooms and bathrooms are identified sex, but if you're enby? 

Good luck, hope you enjoy being naked around a group of people you probably won't feel comfortable around. There's individual changing spaces that can be used but no lockers for individuals there.
I bet it's just a software problem. They'd have to create another data set. Instead they just have you pick which one you'd be most comfortable with.
[removed]
Which gender do you want to see more and house with them 🤷🏼‍♀️
I’m newly coming out as non binary trans male. I feel I’m 50/50. I’m nit linger ever depressed since accepting and want bottom surgery only and be put on testosterone. Identify male as I’ve lived just over 50 years as. Time to experience a new bottom. That means I also can’t tick male or female or both at once. Us non binary people are all different and the same. This is a good argument that the university is not practicing equality. That’s discrimination against a marginalised person. Evil really. They need to be able to provide the same things like rooms for say non binary people like us. By doing so everyone no matter of disadvantage etc can study and live the same. That’s true equality. On top of that they are basically putting you in the corner with no choice and forcing you to make a choice of male or female against your will which is a form of abuse and human rights issue. It’s clear they didn’t read your email. What I saw was you writing that you are non binary but you are not sure if both genders or no genders etc. Life’s hard enough. Mind you once I knew I was non binary I felt a little better. Added the trans and I’m fully me. I’m only just coming out and it’s about less than a week. Seriously because I’m just accepting me etc if I was In that situation it could send me over the edge.  I have so much fear people will reject me. Meaning close grit das and family. Didn’t happen but this school would force me to make a choice and that’s not right. Id seem legal advice. Good luck and know we are a family and don’t take those peoples shit on
Start seeing a lawyer
My school is the same, sort of.  We get to select our gender identity from an expansive list, but we also have to share our biological sex.  Housing assignments are based on sex only; gender is completely disregarded.
They do not know/understand the definition of gender. 😑 
I would look into a more knowledgeable institution..
Why is it an option if you can’t be there based on that what the fuck?
We'Re ToTaLlY InCLuSiVe bUt We NeEd To KnOw If YoU'rE a GiRl NoN-bInArY oR a BoY NoN-bInArY

For real, I'm sorry you got this response and I'm sorry that people do not understand what non-binary means. I am glad and proud of you for seeking ways to get this brought to the attention of people who can do something about it.
jesus and i thought my school was bad with being performative
Currently looking
Yes! Or if they don't, what I might do is find a faculty member who either teaches a subject/class related in some way to equality, or otherwise indicates they'd clearly be on the side of reason here. For example, my dad and cousin are professors. If you looked at their profiles on their colleges' sites you'd see that my dad has taught courses that clearly mention LGBT rights, and my cousin mentions his husband in his bio.
""Diversity and inclusion director""? I want to know a place/country where that things exists because I live in Italy and that sounds like sci-fi here
Yes, currently seeing what I can do.

And I live in the state with the record for transphobic legislation so… yeah lol.
Who knows. It’s really just a form design flaw at this point.
Thanks, this is so lovely and validating! Thanks
yeah i read that and went ???
I second this! I was close friends with a trans girl during my time in college (2012-2016) and she basically got her own big ass room all to herself because once her roommate(s) realized she wasn’t a guy, they didn’t wanna live with her. You might even be able to connect with all the other non-binary ppl on campus and discuss ways to further bring this to the attention of higher ups— maybe you can even request to specifically room with other non-binary ppl too! If yall have an LGBTQ club or org I’d take it to them because they should have a staff member in attendance with each meeting. The Queers & Allies club was amazing at my college and where I realized binary gender was a literal construct of society. Hoping you can have some ease in your college housing friend🤲🏽
I couldn't afford one, and I'm still living at home and a minor.
I’m so sorry you both feel this way. I feel similar at times but, thank goodness, less scared (like for my safety) and more unsure. I used to love forms - filling out information in little boxes and all that. But forms can be so dangerous and uninclusive. I feel sad when I think about that. Good news: you’re safe here!! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️💛🤍💜
Lately, same. I’m so scared about what could happen
Im still hitting ""male"" on job applications and housing stuff and it always makes me grit my teeth
They didn’t lmao
[deleted]
Most schools have residency requirements for traditional freshmen (18-19 year olds) who don’t live with their parents within a certain distance. That’s normal. However, the school should have gender inclusive housing.
Not necessarily. I’d say mandatory gender segregation needs to end, but there are definitely people who would be wildly uncomfortable in mixed gender residences, and that’s ok too.
It’s not Georgia
Why Do People Talk Like This? What Is Being Communicated?
seems more they didnt think about it hard enough when adding other.

They only have binary roomates allowed. this isnt too shocking as enbies are kinda rare. 

however, the numbnuts just tied it to the gender variable out of laziness, instead of giving an option when you select ""other"" of ""do you want a male or female roomate?"" they force you to pick a binary gender to identify as just to get housing
Who are the right people exactly?
Considering
I can look into it
I work in higher ed, this practice is actually very common because of FERPA regulations. It's moreso about verifying that any personal information released is going directly to the student, not a family member/other person accessing their email or attempting to make changes to their enrollment or student records.

Edit: just want to clarify I do think this dorm policy is transphobic and horrible!! Not defending them in *any* way.
I think the person they are dealing with is a dumb ass.
“Drive a truck through this” ❤️❤️❤️
They want to prevent bluetooth pregnancy
No. I’ve contacted the women’s and gender center though. If needed I’ll speak to the dean and res life head.
They should do a better job at specifying this if that’s the case. It comes off much differently.
Agreed, database changes for existing fields can be Super Messy, risky, and expensive, especially if there are multiple systems referencing the existing field for gender. Like, yeah, they may have a plan to fix it but it's not as easy as a switch to flip.

The email says that you can't use the *form* without selecting M or F, but presumably there's another way to get into the system, although it may be more likely that they'd put you either with a roommate of a gender you don't mind rooming with, or in a single room like is often done for on-campus students with some types of medical needs. Definitely get in touch with whatever DEI office is available.
Trolls will not be tolerated.
This one is free 💀 

Not like entirely but I have the most scholarships for this one. I go to almost completely free, whereas I can’t do that with the others I applied to.
Also look for the university ombudsman or human rights director. Most universities, at least in Canada, have one - they mediate and resolve conflicts like these and advocate for students' rights.
Gender Studies is also a key phrase to lookout for.
From my understanding, most schools in the US have them, not all of them (probably). Though I am unsure where else they might be commonly found.

The university I currently attend has one, and they are pretty prominent on campus
Most universities in the Netherlands have them now too, although that's a change in the last few years. So they haven't done that much yet, but at least they're trying.
In my uni (uk) each subject has an EDI (equality, diversity and inclusion) officer who helps deal with this kind of stuff, plus the university wide EDI team
My mental health clinic in the US has one!
I mean in the US they, too, still think it’s sci-fi, which is why it’s commonly uncommon. Outside of schools, some big name companies and startups have these Directors as a way to be “forward thinking”. I had one at a startup company I worked for and she was trash. When BLM broke out she outwardly admitted that she had bouts of micro-aggression that she displayed that she didn’t even *know* was her being inherently racist. So lmao. Again, in the US it’s sometimes sci-fi to us too.
Work at a school in the uk and we have an equality and diversity officer and the college I attended had a equality and diversity student team who were representatives from different minorities who would arrange outings and such.
If this is Georgia Tech, DM me and I can set you up with the right resources (posting both here and on the main thread because I know Reddit notifications can be weird sometimes).
Or it is simply performative inclusion with no intent to ever actually back it with solid policy.
i appreciate the effort but not quite inclusive enough 😅
Your state ACLU might want to hear about your situation if you want to try and challenge it.
Your state's attorney general would likely be interested regardless.
Interesting. Wasn’t the same for my college although you did lose out on certain privileges for not living on campus. Thanks for educating me
I think if you applied that sentence to race you might realize how prejudiced it is
As I Am But One Lowly Person, And Not A Hivemind Of Everyone Who Types This Way, I Unfortunately Cannot Tell You Why People Do It.
I'm not sure, I have went there in over 6 years. You could maybe contact the Lambda organization and see if they or their sponsoring professor could help.
Ohhhhhhh ok. Very interesting, and I learned something new today!! Thanks for the info!!
Hehe I got it from my dad and i love it so much! It’s such a fun phrase!! 💛💛💛
Cool! The closest thing to a Diversity and Inclusion director in Italy is my italian professor that literally said to me ""Sorry, I can't use the correct pronouns because as a teacher  I have to follow the school's rules. Maybe I can respect your pronouns outside of the school's building""
or even meant to 'weed out the undesirables' while maintaining the facade of virtue.
Also very possible.
I was thinking this too. But that just opens them up to even more controversy and backlash to have it and not honor it than to just not have it. Or to just outright ask for AGAB instead.
What's the process for that?
I might look into it
It's valid to feel uncomfortable around particular people but using trauma as an excuse for sexism should no longer be tolerated in 2023. I am a transgender man who has experienced plenty of abuse from cis men. Still I do not say that I don't trust men because, as a man, I understand how crushing and dehumanizing those kind of prejudices are.
Yes if I said that about race it would be racist. What is your point?
yes thank you for the scathing social analysis no shit you could have very easily just said why you do it.
That’s sucks. I’m so sorry your pronouns aren’t being respected. Also what the duck (typo but decided to leave it 😜) kind of post-secondary institution (or anywhere for that matter!!!) has rules saying “disrespect queer & trans people, and whatever you do, don’t even respect a person’s pronouns and use the correct ones if you want a shot at tenure here.” Are they also required to deadname or wtf?
We've got similar things in Germany beside focal points for harassment and stuff... But the politics are very complicated, if something happened you can talk to them but actually they can't do anything for the protection of the victim, they can't exmatriculate or suspend the first abuser as this can only be done by the university and they just won't do it...
I would think it could be a bad idea to put trans fems in a male only residence
Every state has its own chapter and each chapter has a contact form. I live in Oregon so mine looks like this : https://www.aclu-or.org/en/about/contact-us

I used to work in the legal nonprofit world and would reply to intake emails like these. Even if it's not something they would want to take on they should be able to point you to an organization that would.
Unfortunately I Don't Actually Know Why I Do It, So Even That I Could Not Say. I'm Sorry I'm Not Able To Be Of More Help To You.
Actually yes. Professors always used deadname with me. That sucks. It's called italian school system
It is, but this school doesn't seem like it would care or even accept that the student is trans.

Maybe the initial scenario I was introduced to the school made me a lot more cynical about it than logical.
My trans femme friend at SCAD (Savannah, GA) back in 2012-2016 was placed in dorms with males… every single guy she was roommates with ended up moving out except the one bisexual dude🤦🏽 Hopefully things have changed but who even knows! I wasn’t identifying as non-binary at the time so things like housing kinda just went over my head. I had already been conditioned into a gendered society since I went to an “all-girls” HS from 7th-12th grades…
I mean putting anyone in gendered housing that doesn't match their identity is a bad idea. Not just women in men's spaces
pensavo che da noi le cose fossero migliorate... mi spiace :( restero' in california
the letter says ""you'll go whichever you identify as"" which looks like they're inviting trans people to identify as male or female... but erasing non-binary people?

on todays edition of hiding pride flags at my conservative workplace: Nonbinary balloon arch		"I love this but my biggest question is why the 'Party' sign looks so ominous. When I look at it I feel like I am trapped underwater with a bunch of blue orbeez, slowly watching the light recede as I descend...? Your balloon arch is really saving the overall mood haha.
😂 ""What creative color choices!!""
It is your gender.

(The office joke)
Local icon status
Is this a liminal space?
i love this😩😂
I've seen a welding hat with nonbinary flag colors on it. I assumed it was a coincidence. Are you saying someone might have meant something by that design? Cool!
I want the gender of the party sign above the NB arch
Love this. Stealing it for some day
They are magnificent.
Doing the lords work
Omg you’re amazing! fucking stealth it!  Keep up the great work!
This is what I want my coming out party to look like. Flag colored arch. A sign that says “party”. Liminal lighting. Some queso dip for everyone to enjoy.
Do you work at an extremely sad party city
I have this hat that literally has the trans flag on the size adjuster strap, like it's ACTUALLY the flag. Strange thing is it's not a pride hat and I bought it at Sam's Club in Florida of all places 😆
There's no form more graceful than the arch, no object more whimsical than the balloon.
This is amazing.

Now hand it over!
You work in the backrooms bruh
If you were in Minnesota people would assume you’re big into the Vikings
Thanks! The wole place is depressing but I think its more cuz of the customers we get :)
liminal space style party sign for sure
That's exactly how I feel about it!!
my co worker litterally said that hahahaha... ""I woulda never come up with this its so pretty!""
Ha I hope so
exactly it looks kind of depressing
A what?
I can pinpoint why. So the lighting fixtures are pretty small and the picture was taken at night OR the windows are small/completely covered. The space this feeling gives is a time long past when we didn't have lights so bright you couldn't see a shadow, a future yet to come when the world falls apart and spaces like this are meaningless. The picture looks not of the present, creating that backroomsy feel.
ye Ive done more before!! I did the trans and bi flags before :)
...blue balls?
Yessss steal it, spread the NB agenda
Thanks, will do!
Sounds good lol.
Not party city. Extrmely sad? Yes.
This.

Pride outfit, yes or no?		"*Hell* yes
YES! Love
It doesn't matter what you wear. You look amazing. Period. And at Pride, you'll be accepted no matter what, from what I hear! I'm not allowed to go to pride, so any person who is able to is awesome on so many levels in my eyes.
hell yea!
YES!!!!
Huge yesss
It's a yes from me ✌🏻
Brilliant.
😍😍

ps- make sure you use sunscreen, mesh sun burns are a special kind of awful!
So cute! I love it!
Just one word of advice: I think you could wear anything and it would turn out looking good. So yeah :)
Oh hey, is that the G2CB binder? I just ordered it today. Looks amazing!
*inhales*

#YES

I knit a sweater with my pride flag colors!!		"Holy heck good job I WANT ONE
i was looking all over the internet for a sweater or a longsleeve with this exact design 😭 this beautiful person just made it themselve 😆
I LOVE IT.
Your sweater is beautiful!
It’s so good!!!!
Love that! You did a great job on it, must've been a lot of work :)
Very very cool.  Just finished an enby pride crocheted scarf here.l
Ohh it’s perfect. I’m not brave enough to knit sweaters, or pretty much anything that requires me to read a pattern. Hats scarves and blankets lol. How long did it take you to make this? Would you be willing to make others for $$$?
[deleted]
So cute! Your smile is so vibrant, and the sweater is lovely! 😊
I’m in love! That sweater is lovely, looks cozy, and looks great on you! Also, your smile is contagious; it’s so nice to see confidence, joy, and euphoria in others. Thank you for being your incredible self.

#💛🤍💜🖤
Awesome sweater!! Also I love your piercings!!
I love that pattern! I knit my partner one a few years ago and have been thinking about doing one for myself.  Yours looks great!
That looks great and you look great!
that is the coolest thing I've ever seen
That’s awesome!!!!
If I possessed any skill whatsoever I would have done the same thing. Incredible job it's amazing 💛💜
Your gender is valid!!
Rad!!! I want one!!!
poggers!!! i want one :3
:0 it looks so goood <3
i don't always like our pride flag colors but these shades look really nice together! great job!
So nice! I love it!
Sooo great, fellow enby sweater knitter!! Well done! Do I spy the much adored Flax pattern by Tin Can Knits? 🤘
I made a scarf just like it this
Now I NEED one of those! It’s amazing and you’re VERY talented my friend.
I NEED ONE AHHH
That's awesome!!
Great job!  You made a beautiful sweater that is indeed smile-inducing!
Wow, your so talented, it's very beautiful..  How long did it take you to make it?

MY GOD YOU LOOK AMAZING!!!!! i love it honestly
If you're wearing the flag like a cape, please make sure to bring extra water. I made that mistake - it made my back sweat like a mfer. 💀
You look incredible omg!!!!! I want to steal you gender, you look so fucking cool holy shit
your shirt gives tma vibes and i both love and envy that
dude nice pins
You look like youre taking fashion advice from Gerry Keay /pos! Wear something you wear a lot, know you feel comfortable in and love. And remember, sensible shoes
Your look is fantastic. Only thing that I'd add is to have some comfortable shoes with you, just in case your feet get a little sore.
Where’d you get that vest?
Looking great!
Yoo 
That makeup and acessories really banged 
Also why dont you try some metaphor thing?
I was thinking in transgender as a cloud but i kinda didnt see the nonbinary there 
Well i dont have much ideas pall:/
Dude I am *living* for your outfit! The hair? The makeup? The outfit? All so absolutely swag! Did you paint the eye shirt yourself? It looks awesome and now I'm thinking of adding a swirly eye to my battle jacket!
You kinda look like a goth David Bowie
You look like an ethereal badass!
YOU LOOK SO GENDER HELLO??? omfg <33 /pos
Sick vest
Looking amazing!
you can never have enough eyeballs. patches pins paint prop makeup or even googley eyes

Tysm!! I try to be as chaotic as possible lol
Thank you for the tip! I will definitely do this as it's supposed to be pretty hot out
Oh no not my gender!! I'll duel you for it!!
I hand painted an old t-shirt and cut it to be cropped and sleeveless, deadass took like 20 minutes. You should totally make one!
It was easy enough that I'll probably try making more tma inspired stuff!
thanks! i got most of them from local shops/artists!
If I could afford it, there is nothing and no one that could stop me from getting eyes tattooed on every joint of my goddamn body. And thank you! I'll probably wear a delightfully hideous Hawaiian shirt and my platforms 😌
Thank you! And definitely. My platform combat boots are my every day shoes, they're comfy af! 😁
My partner thrifted it. It's got a moth on the back!
Thank you!
Haha thanks! And I met a Glow Cloud at a Welcome To Night Vale tour once
Omg battle jacket. Yes do it, that would look awesome!! And thank you, I did make it myself, I cannot resist putting eyes and spirals on everything i own lmao
Yo that's the best thing I've ever heard 🖤
Aaaahh thank you!

It suits you really well, tbh.
Yeah and your hair colour is really nice. Did you do that, or is it just naturally like that?

My non-binary pride kilt and she/they shirt!		"""You may take our lives, but you will never take OUR PRIDE!""
This is amazing, I love that kilt
Seeing trans people that aren’t teenagers makes me feel happy. Gives me hope for the future if that makes sense
I would love a kilt so much but I don't think it would suit my blobby round shape. You look so fab in this whole lot :D
holy shit this fuckin rocks !!! ive never seen an enby kilt before this day but i love it so much :D
This is so cool!! Did u make the kilt yourself? Or get it custom made? It’s awesome!
I love your outfit!!!
where’d you get that shirt? you look so pretty btw!!
I love everything about your look! *chef's kiss
Your so smart
It looks really good, the kilt goes well with it.
Love this look! You rock it! My kid is rubber necking next to me saying all the cool parts of your outfit, and how much they like it. 😂
So awesome, I’m only spending half the time staring at the synth behind you. Is it a Behringer Deep Mind?
You look amazing!🥰 🎉🤘🏾 I never knew I needed a pride kilt until now, it's so dope. Love the whole outfit! 😍
youre the second person ive ever had gender envy for??!/pos (the first isnt a person- its medicham the pokemon) but like i want to look like you you look so cool
Omg! Changing my pronouns to ac/dc. Love this.

Happy to represent the older crowd, I'll be 45 this year :)
No I bet you would look lovely! I've seen great kilts on all body types
Thank you! My first kilt was much larger than this one, I think they look great on everyone 🥰
There was a seller on eBay making them in this pattern, so I asked if they could do me one in these colors, and they said yep!
Thanks 😊

I used an AC/DC font generator on a website to make the image, then I had it printed by Stickermule (because they were having a sale).
Good eye, it sure is! :D
I am honored ❤
I can share the image I used if you want to get one printed yourself, or DIY with t-shirt paint and freezer paper!
They are pretty great, I got them at my local Pride gathering last weekend, from a local crafter, Eowyn Elleveve. They're upcycled from old sweaters!
Enbious*  😁😉
They were originally all white, I used a fabric marker to add the color 😀

Thanks!
link please?? I need an agender one!
Sweet!
Omg diy! That makes it even cooler!!
Yes I’d love the image thank you!
That makes them even more amazing!
Okay, I dug into it, and my initial order from them was via eBay, but I've ordered directly from them a couple times. My custom one was $100 after shipping last year.

They are soooo kind and these mails cards are so pretty

I'm just having allergies I'm not crying what are you talking about
I sobbed for a half hour straight. I lost my mother figure to cancer almost a year ago, before I ever came out, so a boat load of cards supporting me signed ""Mama Bear""? I was a mess.

Seriously, they'll do this for anyone who needs it. And it made me feel so overwhelmingly loved, I think everyone should have this experience. 💜
Thank you! I more than teared up, it was amazing 💜

Oh sweetie, I'm sure she would have been so proud of you.
Oh my gods thank you so much. I’ll reach out and lyk what happens.
Yea I got it from pinterest
Thanks! 💜
Thank you so much for that. I know she would've, not because I'm all that great but because she was the most loving and caring person I've ever known. And I know she loved me as much as I love her. Feels good to feel so close to her again with this gift. 💜
Yay, I seriously.look forward to seeing other people sharing their experiences.with these lovely people.

I’m one year into being out! I identify as transfeminine non-binary now, and I finally feel like myself! Happy pride!		"I love absolutely everything about your outfit and you look really happy which is pretty great. Happy Pride!
Stunning! 💜 Love the parasol
You look like a mix between shaggy and velma. I mean that in the nicest way possible
Congratulations! So happy for you 🎉🎂🎂
Wowowowow you look stunning!
Adorable!
That is amazing !
You look awesome! Where'd you find the parasol?
That is nice. I only need my dad and the reast of my family to be out to the world.
I love your outfit! You look great! Happy pride!!🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️💞
Love the outift! I wish I had your swag
Mmmm wow soooo sexy
Oh my god Zomg you look amazing! Uh don't mind me asking but uh-- how do you come out as non-binary? I mean my parents fully accept me being lesbian but I don't know how to come out as a non-binary. Have any advice ?
Love the parasol!
That is a VERY cute skirt. I'm jealous. Is it OK to ask if you've been on HRT? I've been for two years...and am taking the steps toward surgical procedures...love the changes--so far. ;  )
How come ""brain-slug?""
This! These are goals!
Awww, thank you! I believe the seller was paperlanternsUSA on Etsy
I fully get it! And in your own time of course. I came out last June to my family, and it was the hardest/best decision to do so for me!
i know it’ll be totally worth it but i’m in the not so fun transitioning phase w my family 🙃 but we’re all worthy of being respected as we truly are much luvvvv 💛💛🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
So! When I came out, I came out hard! lol I’m pansexual, non-binary, and polyamorous. My family is very religious so it was also a bit shocking to them as I had an “atheism kicker” as the icing on the cake.

I had a very supportive sister though who had defended me to my family for me. And that has been incredible.

But when I came out, I made sure that I also gave them resources about pronouns and deadnaming and gender presentation vs. gender identity. And of course, it’s not our responsibility to educate everyone else, but it’s also really meaningful to see if they read what you give them!
At this point, I was on HRT for 6 months. But my testosterone was way out of wack and my estrogen was way under. I didn’t get my T suppressed until a month later.
And thank you!!!

Oh! I also had a hair transplant surgery done about 1.5 years before this photo
It’s a creature from the show futurama! That’s really it other than it being a nickname with gamer friends from a few years ago
Thanks, I'm taking my time. 'Cause my mom need some time to get used to the idea that I'm non-binary. And I'm happy you can be yourself :D
Oh. That's honestly really rad ! :D
Sounds SUPER smart of you!!! I've been ""moving toward the femme,"" too...and now am in a kind of NB place...which you seem to be.
OK. I've been on E and P for two years now..with pretty good results...including essentially B-cup boobs...which I feel VERY good about.  ;  )
I assume to lower your hairline?
The fact that your sister was there for you lol. Thanks !
Oh, things have changed since this post!!! This was back in June! I actually identify as a Trans Woman now… full context: I identified as non binary from 2020 to fall of 2022! But check out my profile for a more up to date pic too! 

At the same time, I really thought I was non-binary. Through much much more self reflection, I finally admitted to myself I was actually just a binary trans woman
Yup! My hairline was receding pretty bad
Thanks for the additional info. I've been moving toward the fem. gender...but have discovered that (for me) that this is more complicated than expected. I still plan my chest augmentation surgery (and other procedures), but have re-grown my mustache... as I've been doing some work at this non-commercial radio station...where they think of me as a male...and I figure that maybe I'll leave it that way until I've been there for awhile...just to keep things simple. There is also the fact that I seem to need to express a ""male-side"" at times...so ""bottom line,"" I suppose I'm NB, but with strong motivation to keep the transition going. Would appreciate your support."	v9ozj3	NonBinary	1151	1.0	2022-06-11 03:43:05
I’ve shared my pride flag dice before, but they take three times as long to make the layers… If you bought pride dice, would you rather have the layers or the colors swirled like the orange set? Wanna see what people like more!		"I think it depends how noticeable you want the flag to be. Both look cool but with the swirls it might not be immediately noticeable as the flag which could be good or bad depending on taste and situation. So yeah I think you should have both options but adjust the price for the ones that take longer.
It might look pretty dope swirled, I like the layers but if it takes longer you should price it accordingly, get your times worth!
Swirled, for several reasons.

First, I just think it would look cooler.

Second, I’m in two DnD groups and I’m only out to one of them. I think the swirl would be a subtle way of showing pride to those who know without outing myself to those who don’t.
The layers one looks amazing! Could you record a video of them rolling, please?
If you did swirl them, is it possible to do yellow/white/purple with black numbers?
Are you on etsy?
Loving the layers, but I can't use those dice. I value the number being clear for someone looking at them standing up from the other side of the table. The numbers should be inked in somehow and very clear
How do you even make the layers? wouldn't the resin just mix and create the swirls? or if you did each one seperately, then they wouldn't stay together. I'm genuinely curious
do you have a website or an etsy where you sell these?
[removed]
I absolutely love the first set! I want them now!
Both are neat, depending on what you're looking for. The layered is great if you specifically want pride dice. The swirly ones are just pretty though. Both definitely have value to dice-lovers <3
1. I love those dice
2. I need those dice
3. I don't know, both ideas would actually be super cool I think but I usually prefer the second type of design
Idk what flag the second set was supposed to be if any so if u are trying to market towards those in the closet that works if not I’d probably say layers
The layers seem much cooler to me, though that may be because I'm very particular about how I mix my yellows and purples. There seems to be a pretty even mix in the comments though, so maybe both depending on supply and demand?
I love the layers
Layers pls😳
I really like them both!
I prefer the layers, but more options are welcome too! :)
Quick question, what are you setting the numbers with? As is, those are unreadable. This is coming from someone who's a DM. Although, these are very cool.
I would like the subtlety of the swirls, personally. I have a BFA if that makes my opinion any more notable. 😂
I prefer the prominent flag if I'm gonna buy it to be a pride flag set. I'd also be willing to pay more for them because it takes you more time to make
Pride dice look lovely!!!
They look so cool! :3
If you make a swirly set I will buy em :)
those are cool :D
I think it would be cool to have one die per color on the flag, but I know that would be hard to do too
I've wanted a set of non-binary flag dice for so long! Do you do commissions/have a storefront?

Edit: I checked your profile and you do :) definitely looking into this soon!!
Heey, we talked about a set like this a while ago but you never got back to me about finishing up the order. Would still love to order :3
I think it's easier to see the numbers when the colours are swirled. Functionality always comes first for me, but the swirl is also a bit more subtle than the actual flag, which I might also prefer if I saw it.
Layers :)
I would definitely prefer the swirled set. Easier to parse the values, at least for me.
id prefer layers personally. but swirls could be used for hiding it from parents. So both work well IMO
Layers. Like onions.
Already got a set similar to your layered one and I love it. I really like the swirled set too though, and I'd def buy it if I saw it in a store (I really like that style of d4, btw)
They're both nice, but i like the first one more (layered looks better imo, and is easier to differnciate between the colours / is more obvious what you're going for)
The second one!
FOR THE IMPERIUM!!!!!!!!!!!!
They look great 😺. Can I buy them from europe? How much would shipping cost? 
It would be great to see pictures of both variants with finished numbers.
i love these!!!!! just as they are!
Seconded. 

These are v cool, btw.
That’s true, but it’s mostly just waiting that takes longer? So it takes more to restock, and I know especially for these non-binary ones I’ve had a lot of requests
I was thinking the same thing regarding swirls and subtle pride! I might offer them as an “on request” kind of deal
I wish I could, these bad boys have a new home now, but I’m working on more! I will definitely get a video together!
Ooo that would be good so the black wouldn’t overwhelm the base die but still be included, I love that!
I am! https://etsy.me/31rzxl7
I was just very excited to share them so these are before they’ve been inked. Gotta make sure you can read for sure!
Luckily resin sticks to resin! So I’m able to let each color layer cure at least most of the way before working on the next, that’s why it takes so much longer
I do! https://etsy.me/31rzxl7
These aren't really ""unique shapes"". They're the traditional set used for tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons. Usually each player would need at least one of each: four-sided, six-sided, eight-sided, 10-sided, and a 20-sided die.
I’m working on adding them to my stock! I love the colors together so much!
I’m working on restocking these ones and I miiiight do both styles? We shall see! Feel free to message me for details!
The orange set is just an example of the swirl effect in general, not for any pride flag. But I was considering the swirls for those who may be closeted for any reason so it’s not so obvious
Yeah across all my platforms it seems like layers are the most requested but some people mentioned swirls being a great subtle option for those not out yet, so I may do an “on request” swirl option!
I like them both for different reasons, decisions are hard!
I might do “on request” swirls for those looking for more subtle pride options!
Ah I always forget to mention these are raw right out of the mold because I get too excited to share before inking 😣 Readable dice are so important absolutely
I thought about subtle swirls for those maybe not out yet!
Thank you!
Thank you!
I’m thinking about offering the swirls “on request” as most people like the layers, but the swirls are so neat and subtle pride!
Thank you!
That’s how I did the rainbow flag! Could do 2 dice of each color hmmm
I’ll also link here in case anyone else is interested because I do indeed! https://etsy.me/31rzxl7
Thank you for reminding me, let’s make it happen!
Ah I always forget to say these are raw straight from the mold because I get too excited to share before inking 😣 Definitely need to be able to read them!
Ah I always forget to say these are raw straight from the mold because I get too excited to share before inking 😣 Definitely need to be able to read them!
I was thinking about that too, might offer subtle pride options!
I don’t usually do international shipping because it’s at min $20 USD which is about what I charge for the dice themselves and most people aren’t willing to pay it plus wait that long, but feel free to message me if you are still interested!
Thirded!  The layers are definitely more flag-like, and for people who are out, probably preferable.  THere's definitely a market for the subtler ones though, especially for younger folk who might need to fly under their families' radar.  I definitely owned a lot of actual rainbows when I still lived with my parents because I didn't dare own a rainbow flag.
Either way it still takes more of your time, I would try them swirled see how it does and then see how adding an option to customize them as layered at a different price will do ? Sounds like people love your creations either way and if you’re a small business they should understand
💜
aaaaahhh the Enby dicce aren't thereee?‽!

also do you do full 11 sets? Please take my money 🥺

(oh also, layered the enby look absolutely stunning)
Thank you!
Let me share the excitement then! These are very pretty, I'd love a set like this n.n
Oh I'm curious how you inked them as well! Did you use gold? White or black seems a bit unpractical.
I see, that makes more sense

*starts cursing myself for being so binary in my thinking*
Neat - just went and looked - I've never seen a 2 ""sided"" die (i.e. the equivalent of flipping a coin) with dice sets, and now I don't know why not!  Love your work.
you forgot the 12 😉
[removed]
Yeah it’s one of my favorite flag designs
Ah ok
That's a good pal.
You're welcome!
np
I find readability difficult on striped dice, even when the numbers are painted! I might be in the minority there though
4thd, I’d pay extra for layered ones!
True! I also thought some folks may want something flag inspired as opposed to distinctly flag for safety reasons, so maybe having options would be better?
I could probably do an 11 piece set! And yeah, I’m working on restocking my pride dice, this one was a custom order! Feel free to message me about what you’re looking for though!
I went with silver!
It was a surprise included in my master set for making my molds and I loved them! Had to include, I just don’t do it on the layered dice because it’s so hard to get the layers right
d2 is a pretty rare thing to need, you can flip a coin for it, or roll any other die and just call high/low or even/odd.
I knew I was missing one! Thanks!
Post people are familiar with the cube d6 for board games, so I definitely understand enjoying the other kinds of dice a bit more lol And now you know something new!
I can definitely see that, I get where you’re coming from
Exactly and as a consumer I love having options!!
Yeah that’s what I’ve always done previously. People always seem to like having a d2 included even if they don’t use it though, just the novelty I spose!"	r2sy8t	NonBinary	1126	1.0	2021-11-26 17:57:14

My partner & I have been creating Pride Birds this past month! We aren't done yet, so stay tuned for more but we wanted to share them with you all!		"I feel like the Non-Binary one should've been a goose.

And I'm not biased. The fact that I'm Non-Binary and have geese is completely irrelevant! 😇
They look awesome. If I knew a juweler, I would ask for your permission to ask them to make me a brooch from these
Omg I love this … I was literally jus asking someone if they made a hummingbird dangle in NB colors!!!
I love how subtle these are, but still totally work if you know! The art is also great!
I absolutely love these and the art is fantastic!
As an enby with birds as their hyperfixtation, this overwhelmingly grants my seal of approval
Omg I love them! Are you planning on making an Omni one?
I have a idea for you... Combinations! For example.. I call myself a non binary lesbian
A pigeon or a goose should be the autism pride flag if you ever make this a series!! Love these cute good bois
Ooh pretty!! I love them!
These are really lovely!
These are so gorgeous!
They are so cute
cutest shit ever! are y'all selling prints or stickers???
You should make these into enamel pins or stickers!
this actually made my day
I love these so much!!!! Do y’all have mobile wallpaper versions? :’)
Can i save them?
I'm not aromantic but something about that art piece is astronomically awesome
Oh my god i LOVE all of these
*foams at mouth* birbs! birbs! birbs! these are all so pretty i can't! <3
I love these!!!
Absolutely love these!
Incredible!
Love these! Can’t wait to see more work in the future.
OMG is that a demisexual chickadee?!! 😍🥰 I love it! I may be a bit partial, being a demisexual who's grandfather called them chickadee as a child. I've always loved chickadees, and plan to get one tattooed in memory of my grandfather who passed last year.


These are ALL so beautiful. I look forward to seeing more.
These are absolutely beautiful!!🤩🌈✨ Thank you so much for taking the time to do these🥰 You and your partner have done a great job😍
i love these so much! you two are really talented !
I'm super curious what Agender for this would look like. These look stunning
Awww, they're so cute! :)
There needs to be atleast one that just a crow sat next to a dumpster fire
i love this so much!!!!!!!! u have made a queer bird lover v happy today :)))))
(it’s me i’m the queer bird lover)
oh i love this! super cute, do you plan on using a conure for any flags?
That Galah is rad AF. He's got them fluffenchops 😍
Berb
Could you do neptunic? It mean a lot!
I dont have geese but I def agree!
Goose + tulips could be modified for many flags since tulips come in all kinds of colors
Oh my that would be amazing to see!
that's an awesome idea omg
We might be able to make something like that happen! Keep up with us and we’ll announce it as soon as we can.
Yes! Totally our plan. The flag backgrounds are simply for social sharing but when we release them as stickers, they’ll very subtly represent peoples identity. 

If you aren’t able to be “loudly” out in your life, these could be a really awesome way to feel better in a tough environment
Thank you!
We narrowed to a list of 16 for this initial batch because there are a lot, but we fully intend to take requests into consideration once we wrap this series up. There’s already a few others we’d like to do in the future!
Hi there! Not sure if you've been able to see, but we have posted the remainder of our series on other subreddits and our socials! Including Omnisexual :)

We also have stickers (and prints!) up on our Etsy store now. We'll be looking into a way to share a collection of phone/desktop wallpapers this coming week!https://www.etsy.com/shop/RedWrenCreativeArt
That could be a lot of fun! Maybe even a potential “your character here” or custom commission type thing. Especially if someone wanted the birds/flowers changed around within the color scheme restrictions of the flag.
Thanks so much!
Thank you! 🥺
We will be! Wrapping up a few more birds the next week or so and then we’ll be dropping stickers, prints, etc!

Ohh, I’ll get those created as soon as possible! We update more frequently on Instagram/Twitter if you want to know sooner after we get those made!
Certainly! They have our watermark on them, but definitely credit us if you do share it anywhere. We’ll likely be sharing phone wallpaper versions soon along with stickers! Working on some other ideas but you can keep up with us on other socials if you want
The great thing about these pieces of art is that they can be just that too. As stickers without the flag backgrounds, they can just be pretty birds & flowers, or they can represent your identity if that’s the attachment you want to make.
Thank you!
Thanks! Looking forward to continuing making art with my partner!
It is! So glad to hear it spoke to you so dearly. We love stuff like that.
Thank you so much!

very glad to hear! that’s the goal!
I don’t believe we are currently but happy to take suggestions/commissions in the near future!
A real cutie
Exactly! Also you should totally post a link when the stickers are available. I'd love to have one
You're quite welcome!!
Or aroace since this one already has it's own flag (sorry if ""it"" isn't fitting here, I'm not a native speaker)
Welp.. You're welcome
yayyyy Im so excited!
Sweet, I’ll head over!
Ooh it's absolutely lovely! Such a pretty drawing! You did Agender and all of these so perfectly ❤
Totally! There’s a ton of flags out there already to visualize. I’m sure we’ll get to them soon enough
We certainly might still slowly add a lot of other ideas/ flags that we weren’t able to do this round without asking people to pay us for that.

But we are artists looking to make our joint creative endeavor a financially viable pursuit and that does mean that in some ways we will need to generate income and combination requests/individual identities may come with a price tag to make it viable for us."	vugyqh	NonBinary	1079	1.0	2022-07-08 18:09:15
a day late but i made a cake for pride month!		"Thank you for also declaring yourself as a converse queer in this picture.
the fit, the finger guns, the pose, the cake... this is such a gay picture, it’s fantastic
The energy is this picture is freaking amazing, you go!
Every month is pride month if you want it to be.
i hope you all had a good month! i love n support you all 💕 this is my first pride being out as nonbinary and im kind of sad to miss the parades n such, but im still proud to be me and proud to be trans and proud of all the progress ive made so far
The energy of your joy captured in this is truly amazing

Happy Pride, luv
Every month is Pride. The happiness radiates from this photo and it’s honestly amazing!
Us gays really can't sit in chairs right
Are you a day late and dollar short
I love your nails 💅😍
That cake looks really good ngl
Yo okay this is some Sonic Adventure box art energy and it's absolutely killing it.
YOURE SO CUUUTE
Nah, you're actually 335 days early.  😆
How...the leg, it's just up?
LOVE IT!!! was it as good as it looks?
um did you want to be any cuter, holy crap!!! this is the best!!
I aspire to embody the energy in this image, it's so powerful!! Happy pride month to you!!
im also a doc martens queer 🌚 the duality of nonbinary individuals
The finger guns and inability to operate a chair makes the inner bisexual in me scream in joy.

And the outer bisexual too.
Every month is pride month if you allow yourself to be consumed by hubris
I’m in the same boat! Super sad there isn’t irl pride but coming out is such an experince and my life wasn’t destroyed like my fears told me so I’m just going to live on that high. I am totally proud of you too! You look like you are killing it and living your best life and that cake is amazing. ^_^

Have fun for me. I can’t go to pride this year the city not having it.
I like how the playstation logo is utilized for pride colors here, nice touch!
You're my hero
Yalls vibes are IMMACULATE 😙👌
Tell your parents to go sit in syrup and let the bees get'em.  Im sorry hun. 😞

this is my favourite pride makeup look I’ve ever seen!!! I love how soft the colours are and the stars look so sweet

You look so good I love it. I wanna shave my head too but I got to let it grow a bit more and then I might do it- uwu
omg stunning!!!! so beautiful!!!!!
I love it so much! You look great :)
Wow that looks great! I thought it was a filter at first.
Amazing!!
because you *are* super cute! keep rocking it my friend!
Hello~ I used the Nyx white liquid liner here, the brush tip is narrow enough to let you do small details. I just got mine online! :)
Thank you!! <3 Shaving my head was very liberating for me, and I was really glad I did it! If you do decide to move forward with it, please consider donating your hair to your local cancer foundation :)

Simultaneously the gayest outfit I've gotten, and my new favorite! Is that a coincidence? Plus new pride laces!		"Super cool outfit! The style really suits you, you look fantastic in it! 😁

Where did you get the laces? I love them!
you pull off that fishnet and top combo so well!!! i'd try it myself but i'm a bit too chubby to look good in it lol
You look so good!
Where are your pants from?! 😍
Aaaa you’re adorable!! You look so good and this outfit is so cute, plus those laces are amazing 🥰
I've been looking for mesh sleeves, but those fishnets slay.

you are incredibly gender

I love it so much!!! You look awesomely cool! today I also wore my gayest outfit for the first time and it was quite a revelation
I’m obsessed!!!! I WOULD TOTES WEAR THIIIIS AHHH SO CUTE YOURE ADORBS!!! 🤘🏻🥰rock in bech hehe!!! Style immaculate!!!!

Omg I had these trousers for like 2 years and almost exclusively wore them over any other jeans or anything
🎶 _The boots, the boots, the boots are on fiire…_
Loooooove
omfg i love this for you omg
you’re so pretty
yoooo it looks so good on you! i love your hair btw!
I love your style!
Drop Dead Gorgeous
It really suits you! you look great!
A very cute and chic look with the fishnet body suit and the crop top with the comfortable and stylish pants. The laces add a nice statement of pride to your lovely look. A piercing done for your navel would look so nice with your exposed waistline.
Goals right here
i have the same pants lol
I know nothing of fashion lmao but your outfit looks excellent! I never knew laces like that existed and my life is now objectively better with that knowledge
i cant wear any good outfits well ;-;
Thank you!! I got the laces on Etsy! They're from the lloydlabel store. There were like three different places selling them though!
You should definitely try! Basic fishnets are really cheap online, like less than $10 cheap, so if you don't like it, it's not that big of a deal. One of my favorite combos is a dress/skirt with fishnet leggings. That looks great on everyone!
The pants are from Shein, I wouldn't recommend them because they feel like they're gonna fall apart as soon as I wash them lol. They'd probably be easy to find on better sites since they're just plaid high waisted pants 😛
The laces are my favorite part! I'm lucky they're not torn the hell up already. Lacing up boots near a playful cat was not my best idea lol
Definitely a power move hahaha
The pants are from Shein and the top is from Romwe, but I wouldn't recommend them lol. All the accessories are from Etsy though, and I got my boots on sale at Kohl's.
I'm tempted! I'd definitely do the same if I had more tops that matched them (: my patterned sweater addiction clashes with anything other than solid colors unfortunately
It's mostly lighting, angles, and posing. I spend like an hour taking pictures because lenses don't work like eyes and you have to make lots of subtle changes to get 3d people to look right in a 2d picture (:
Thank you! I'll have to have a look! 😁
You're wearing both a fishnet top and leggings, right? Or is it a fishnet bodysuit?
oh no, i love myself some fishnet leggings, i have a pair of red ones i wear with one of my favorite skirts. It's more the crop top/fishnet bodysuit i'm worried about hehe
Dang. They're so cute. I really like the yellow cause it's my favorite color lol
You are so fucking right
I always went similarly to how you have or a white t shirt and loooong denim over shirt thing but I love the fit you’ve got
Just a bodysuit here. The leggings are such a pain in the ass to put on that I only wear them when they're extremely visible lol
The yellow really stood out to me. It's a nice change of pace compared to the rest of my wardrobe that's mostly black haha
Hehe yeah, same tbh... But you just made me realise I really want a fishnet bodysuit, so thank you for that haha

Your outfit really looks fab
Ahah same! All black everything."	sfo5zx	NonBinary	983	1.0	2022-01-29 18:22:55
I did a pride photoshoot with my bf to celebrate the start of my transition 🏳️‍🌈		"At first glance I thought your shirt said “I am the pride” and was confused by the powerful energy that emitted
Hey, love you, love this but quick question, how ur armpits not itchy? if i dont shave it be itchy as fuck.
Omg yessss hello royalty! You are gorgeous wow!!
aaaaa congrats on starting! you look fab af 🤘💝
Those photos are stunning! What camera and lens did your boyfriend use? Also, you look STUNNING 🤩💖
That would be an INCREDIBLE shirt omg
There is an itchy phase, but after they fully grow in it becomes soft
Love you too, ngl my armpits used to get crazy itchy when I didn't shave but they haven't recently and I'm not 100% sure why? I switched from stick deodorant to spray deodorant so that may be what's helping!

I am the Empress of my Animal Crossing island 😂 thank you sm!!
Thank you!! I'm excited to do another shoot once my transition is complete 😍
Thank you! 😍 He said it's a Nikon D750 and 50mm f1.2
I haven't shaved in at least a month or two haha I just don't grow very much armpit hair 😂

A warning about Pride month and trolls - reddit has plastered us on billboards without consent.	"Hi, r/nonbinary. 

A concerned user made us aware that reddit's marketing division put the name of our sub on billboards in the US and Canada to promote *themselves* for Pride month. 

Here are two billboards. One is in [San Francisco,](https://www.reddit.com/r/BayAreaLGBT/comments/o0tc13/reddit_ad_in_sf_i_think_this_is_my_favorite/) the other [somewhere in Canada.](https://mediaincanada.com/2021/06/15/reddit-kicks-off-first-campaign-in-a-canadian-media-strategy/)

That is, reddit the company decided to promote *themselves* as being supportive of non-binary people by exploiting our sub--which is already a troll magnet and was the site of a serious brigade that resulted in several subs being banned from the site--by exposing us in a huge way, not bothering to ask permission, and not bothering to give us a heads up.

There is so much wrong with this it makes my head hurt to think about drafting the complaint letter. 

We have already had an uptick in both text trolls (the ones who post harassing comments and the oh-so-clever Pokemon screenshot) and in porn trolls. Please, if these get past the spam filters and automod--report them so we can keep the sub as cleaned up as possible for our real members. 

Feel free to use this post an as an open thread to rant about the hollowness of corporate Pride and ""ally"" fails."	"Not trying to detract from OPs discussion, but those ads are how I found out about this community and I’m really happy I did. Kind of repeating other comments here but I do wish Reddit would provide meaningful support to communities like this one.
If they gave a shit about the LGBT+ community they'd actually *do* something about all the rampant bigotry. But they don't, so they don't.
Ah this sucks, I love this community. 

I hope this doesn't negatively impact the security people feel here. It's such a kind and supportive place right now...
Not surprising but holy shit.
On the one hand this is incredibly stupid on Reddit’s part bc they don’t actually moderate hate like they claim to and they’re very far from allies of nearly any kind but on the other hand I’m kinda glad in the way that newer enby people may see it and find the community that way

Just trying to find something good from it ://
All I can think of is to scream in frustration. At the very least they should have heads upped, and really should have dedicated a paid staff mod for each sub they decided to plaster on this ill-thought ad that basically invites brigading.
Reddit seriously took something that WE MADE (we meaning queer people in general) independently of them, but on their site, and was like “look how progressive we are!!” They’re basically just saying “look! We’re super great allies because we allow queer people to create their own spaces on our platform and don’t stop them!” Like come on, really??
While it was a bad move all around, I'm actually less annoyed about this sub being included than some of the others. Here, r/lgbt, r/gay, etc., are all pretty straightforward names that trolls really don't need a billboard to find, or anything beyond the most basic knowledge of how Reddit works. If someone wanted to come troll nonbinary people, this was always the logical URL. 

The ones that can't be intuited, though...Ones you generally have to be at least somewhat familiar with LGBT Reddit to find...Reddit really did just go and paint a target on them, didn't they?
That ""somewhere in Canada"" billboard is in Toronto. Dundas square is basically Toronto's Time Square.
🙄 reddit, always classy /s
Yeah, if Reddit actually gave a shit about queer folks, the lesbian subreddit wouldn't be full of nothing but porn.
Definitely Toronto :)
Whoa!
I’m a huge nerd, been on Reddit for a long time, and found this sub after first hearing the words “non-binary” last year which caused me to come out finally. But as a Redditor, I know how to find things here.I didn’t need an ad.

But for folks who don’t know of Reddit and are questioning, confused, and figuring themselves out, seeing something like this public and spreading awareness is so great. 

I know posting on this sub and reading everyone’s posts questioning or figuring themselves out finally here has been literally one of the most affirming and positive things for me since coming out. 

Sure, Reddit probably thought they were doing a helpful thing and apparently didn’t ask, and yeah, it comes off in bad taste to other comrades here, and of course their obvious self-promotion (it is an ad on a billboard), but I would rather this exist and be out there than not. We will get some trolls, but we will get people discovering themselves and their fellow enbys, so they can thrive and live happier and fuller.
thats kinda fucked

im not super familiar with automod but can you configure it to filter comments and posts from ""new"" (recently created, or recently subscribed) users? there'd be false positives but might help yall stem the flood if it gets too much
What’s crazy is Reddit doesn’t give a shit about homophobia and transphobia, and just let’s these things slide
> the oh-so-clever Pokemon screenshot

I should probably be glad that I don't think I know about this one.

Most ([though not all](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_with_gender_differences)) Pokemon species appear identical regardless of assigned gender, anyway (leaving out whether they'd be aware enough to identify otherwise), and the differences are minor when they don't. Oh, the horror.
I learned from a philosophy course that one can do deeds that are, 'good' yet do so for their own gain.
Do you think it's wrong to put the other subreddits on the billboard?
I find it ironic that so many transphobic people use Pokemon as a transphobic meme. Do they not know there's genderless pokemon? And a lot of them are pretty popular to use in competitive play? I mean there's Magnezone, Metagross, Shedinja, Rotom, Mewtwo, Mew, Melmetal, etc. There's more than a 100 genderless pokemon out there.
That's not representation, that's rainbow capitalism..
Anyone seen the they/them and other pronoun shirts at target? Anyone notice how ridiculously overpriced they are? I was really upset by that because it’s like ‘yay, pride! Ok, now give us money!’
Ugh, this is disgusting. I'm so glad I haven't seen anything bigoted but I'm sorry to the people who have.
Can confirm there's at least one more in socal.
OP. Please do look into drafting a letter of complaint. And reach out to the other subs mentions on the billboard, ask if they wish to collaborate and make it a group complaint.
Reddit has already proven they don’t believe in free speech when they banned r/chapo trap house and a bunch of other left leaning subs when they banned r/ the Donald, as if they were at all equal in their hate, and just know everyone: this platform, the people who run it, don’t care at all about you or me, they just point to us when it’s convenient. It’s the same thing as td bank putting a pride flag on their logo one month out of the year, and bankrolling companies that discriminate against gbtqia+ community every day of the year, even in June. It’s called “rainbow capitalism”.
without our consent, i hope youre joking and have read the users agreement...
i'm glad you found this sub, friend. that's definitely the silver lining of reddit's exploitative behavior and i hope other nonbinary folks find this sub, too
I don't think anyone is saying that them promoting the sub is in of itself bad but they should have absolutely gotten permission and a heads up so moderators could understand be prepared for what was to come, and hopefully get support from admins if they needed it.

I'm glad you found the sub though, welcome! This place has really helped me with my gender identity 😊
Welcome friend!
There is definitely positives to Reddit featuring the sub, but:

* Firstly, they *should've* given moderators a heads up.

* Secondly, they *should've* extended an offer to provide additional moderation support through this month.

* Thirdly, they *should* be continuing to actually act on the banning of the exceptionally toxic hate subs, including homophobic and transphobic ones.

With regards to the last, I recently discovered that they most definitely are not, I encountered a *400k+* hate sub, which has apparently been known about for some time and which is still persisting.

One other thing as well, is when a user is banned/suspended, that's it, the Reddit admins i don't believe look at the subreddits said user moderates. Often hate subs have a moderation team that at least partially actively engages in hate. The result is that these hate subs continue unaffected, and become free from any moderator control.
Because bigotry leads to profit. That's all reddit wants in the end.
Add to this the fact that AskGayBros is on there..... literally promoting one of the most bigoted ""inclusive"" subs out there
""Some people want no bigotry. Some want all the bigotry. We compromised at some bigotry.""- Reddit
This. I can’t even begin to count all the “Please Jill yourself messages” I’ve received the past 3 days & u/Reddit does NOTHING to them.
I hope we see an uptick in legitimate new users we can welcome. I hope we as a community will see this as an opportunity to support ourselves by being vigilant about reporting problematic behavior. I hope we as a community will renew our efforts to be welcoming and inclusive of folks who are questioning but phrase things poorly. I hope we'll see a decrease in gatekeeping who is and is not allowed to be non-binary or seen as legitimate. I hope reddit gets a ton of backlash for showing off their GSM subreddits during pride while actively undermining the safety of GSM individuals and communities and donating to anti-LGBT+ politicians etc. I hope we can brainstorm good language for a complaint letter to reddit, and that it gets picked up by the media, since that's the only way it will result in change.
Yeah...
It's already set to do this, and is a PITA we wish we could stop, b/c even with careful tweaking it nabs a lot of legitimate comments that need manually approved.
Some of the pokemon games open with the professor asking ""are you a boy or a girl?"" to select your character sprite/model.
I think they meant that the mods should have been given warning or asked for consent at least cause yes it can introduce new enbys to the sub but it also exposes it to hate from horrible people.
They don't think that much. It's surface-level trolling, lol.
Most definitely!
That’s a fair point. Even if they wanna get all “it’s on our website; it's proprietary,” it’s still bad form to not even give a heads up
Thank you- this is such a wonderful and supportive community, I'm really happy to be here!

This weekend's look for pride		"Great, now I'm even gayer
I absolutely LOVE your look, holy shit!!! I can feel the gender envy in the back of my mind, damn.
wow, you give me so much gender envy.
OMG SHFJABJTABGJAHGAVJGVAFJ
Hawt, suspenders are such a great enby look in general.
I wore that same shirt to the pride event I went to!!!
You look great! I absolutely love the sporran.
Yas Please! <3

I love your look, you rock it.
Glorious!
oh my gosh YOU LOOK AMAZING
Omg I think I may have seen you at pride whaaat
What a LOOK! Especially your eye makeup! Amazing 👌👌👌
have mercy im already gay lol 🫡❤️ but seriously you look absolutely stunning! what a showstopper!!!
you remind me of the spiral guy from the magnus archives. i know you probably don’t know what that is but you look SO good
Where did you get that outfit, sibling?
✨ W O A H ✨




-Buggo
Looking fabulously gay
Wow!!! Love it !
I adore your makeup! You look amazing!!
Face. Tell the person to smile. Watch to see if their face droops.
Arms. Have the person raise both their arms. Watch to see if one is weak or sags.
Speech. Ask the person to say a simple phrase. Listen for slurred or strange-sounding words.
Time. Every minute counts. Call 911 right away.

FAST
Right?? Like why did I put this off for so long?
It’s perfect! I’d love to pull you in <3
Omg hi! Lol
Google was unhelpful, sorry ._.
Shirt and skirt from Spencer's! Accessories here and there from Poshmark
That is a simply yet amazingly affirming compliment thank you so much!
-?
It’s okay! I just realized if I linked it to you it would be a spoiler. But you look awesome:)
Shit.  Nothing at Spencer's fits me.
Loving that bowtie tho.
Lol I was making a dumb medical joke 😅 
That's how you check if someone is having a stroke.

Hitting the club for Liverpool Pride this weekend		"Is that a non-binary flag dress?? Holy smokes that’s awesome! Also, you’re rocking it <3
I had an outfit change at one point too.

https://i.imgur.com/K1hxZu2.jpg
WHERES THE DRESS!!! GEMMMEEEEEE
Love the dress!! I've been looking for a shirt/hoodie like that lol. It suits you so well!
Great to see another local on this sub. Your look bangs x
Oh my god, I have this same dress for Chester Pride, because I bought a bigger size from you!

You look fucking amazing!! Have a great Pride!
Rocking it!
Omg you look amazing!!! <3<3<3. May you lay siege to the ramparts of your enemy and raze their strongholds to the ground <3
You look great, and nice flip in that pic, but still looking ready to stay for hours
Omfg i love this picture. OWN THAT ATTITUDE  and REPRESENTING WITH THE FLAG! AHHHHHH ITS FANTASTIC! So cute!
You’re scary,

I love it.

Have fun!
Purple bombshell
I love that dress!
Looooove, did u make or buy the dress? Edit: Never mind I see the answer! The cut actually really works for you I think!
Yaaaassss!!
Awesome outfit! You will be read as female though.
It is! It's not my usual cut (it's an A-line) but I couldn't resist it for Pride.

And thank you so much ♥️.
Haha! Glad you like it. It's just an A-line dress from Red Bubble, so easily obtained. It felt very appropriate for Pride parties.
Thank you! It means a lot.

Red Bubble will be able to do any of those for you. I have the exact same print on a graphic tee too, haha. Also a bi one (which got a lot of approval from Courtney Act when I met her).
Ah, hello there! 👋

And thank you so much! I'm dancing the night away in Heaven here.
Oh wow, that's crazy, haha - the eBay person! I hope it fits! I mean, as an A-line it's kind of loose fitting anyway, but it's still got to be just right.

And thank you so much! Far too kind.
Thanks so much ♥️!
Thank you kindly ♥️!

And I'm totally stealing that amazing line, haha. So good.
Thank you! ♥️

I do believe I left for home at nearly 4am, which isn't bad as I get older, haha.
Ahhh, I love the enthusiasm! Thanks so much. I usually hate how I look but think I did okay here.
That's the best compliment I could receive, haha.
💜💜💜
Thanks! It's great isn't it? I saw it and knew it'd be my Pride outfit immediately.
I wish I could make clothes even a little bit, haha.

Thanks! I don't normally go for this cut - I either go for a tight dress or a huge, flowy, witchy one. I'm glad this works!
💜💜💜
Ah I'm happy with whatever, haha. I'm AMAB and think my manner can come across quite masculine at times so it all levels out!
Non binary doesn’t have to come off as super “androgynous”! It’s important to show people that non binary is a spectrum and not one single look!
Ohh goodness did you do ok! You did WAY BETTER than just ok.  The background is BEYOND STELLAR! The smoke, the cool looking background darkly lit english pub feel. The field of depth focus is fantastic. I love that you are the brightest thing in the room, gorgeous as all heck. Not to mention, the most bad a@@ part is that the only finger we can see is the middle one. Kinda like a serious fu to all the haters out there who nag and degrade the NB community. Like a ""i am who i am, deal with it"" look and its so loud and proud, im jealous of your style. Extremely in love with this photo. Carry on and bravo to you for being awesomely gorgeous and good for this community, and bravo for the photographer cuz wow. Was this just a camera shot from a phone?
Yeah!  I need more pride outfits, I just need to get out more, but the Dysphoria and depression(DnD lol) have been hitting hard lately... I hope yer days been good lol 💖 sorry forgot how replies work lmao
Okay. Sorry I'm a new NB.
Ahhh this is all so kind! Thank you immensely! It means so much. It is just a phone camera, yeah. It's the Pixel 3, but it has a 'Portrait' mode which I find AMAZINGLY useful - it really does wonders for the focusing and whatnot. The lighting I can't take credit for, haha. 

This comment has really touched me and it inspires me to just keep on doing what I want to do.
Aww, I know how that is. I suffer from anxiety and depression myself. Sometimes the meds help, sometimes they make things worse. Frustrating!
No worries! 🌈
Yeah, well I hope my first hormone appointment helps lol 💖"	cjor32	NonBinary	915	1.0	2019-07-30 08:20:53

my older brother found my pronoun badge...	"Context: my older brother, he's pretty...right wing I'd say. He likes conservatives, throws slurs around like there's no tomorrow, has a questionable ""sense of humor"" and all that jazz. (This happened on the 5th of November but I can't stop thinking about it and especially his reaction) 

Me, him, my older sister and my older sisters friend was cleaning the house because we were going to have like a get together kinda thing. My older sisters friends were coming over for fireworks, a bon fire, and drinks to chill.

So, we were cleaning and my little sister, about 10 minutes before what happened next, was looking through my jacket pockets (a jacket I wore everywhere) and in there was a small-ish, metal pin that just had ""they/them"" on it that I got from pride earlier in the year. 
I wore the pin when I wasn't at home, so when I went out with friends, or went to school, I wore that pin. (Wasn't that safe to wear it in school but I liked the fact that it pissed people off but I digress). 

So, while looking for whatever she was looking for, she pulled everything out of my pockets. And my pin was one of them. She didn't put anything that she took out of my pockets back in my jacket and she left it on the stairs. 
My older brother was cleaning near the stairs and he found my pin.
 He just shouted loudly ""who's pin is this?"" Because all you could see was the back of it, not what was on the front. 
I had also been preparing a lie to tell anyone in my house if they found the pin. Saying it's a friend of mines and I took it from them and I'm waiting to see if they notice. 

He picks the pin up, saw what was on it, and shouts (again) 
""why the fuck does someone have a (t slur) pin?"" 
And I just felt like I couldn't breath. My little sister didn't help either, accidentally letting it slip that it came from my jacket pocket. 
He looks over at me and asks the question again. I told him the lie I was practicing. 
""It's my friend's. I took it and I wanna see how long it will take them to notice I have it"".
And to that, he just said
""Good, cause I'm not having a gender queer sister""
I took it from him and I felt sick to my stomach, but I hid it and continued cleaning. 

We haven't spoken about it since. (I thought I lost the pin but I just found it >:) )"	"Sorry this happened to you. My older sibling was not very supportive of me. I won’t project my experience on to yours, but I’ll share a thought : you’re you no matter what any family member says can or cannot exist.
[deleted]
first reaction: f him in particular for using those words as his ""sense of (very shitty) humor""

second reaction: are you safe where you are because if not I'm sure some of the others here have amazing resources that can at least get you connected with some people who aren't as closed minded as a concrete slab 

third reaction: (coming from a thankfully accepting family view which I feel bad sometimes that not everyone has had that same thing...) 

Fuck it, be yourself and if they don't like it they can suck it up and either realize how stupid being a one minded person is or they can get out because there's more to life than being a biggoted waste of breath.

Hope you're okay OP
*hugs*
Your brother sounds like a real POS. At the very least radicalized beyond basic decency of humanity.

Do your sisters share his perspective? Are you safe or comfortable speaking with them about this? Is he an anomaly or the norm within your family?

Beyond all this: your chosen family of your peers does and will support you throughout your life. Sharing a bloodline with someone does not make their opinion on anything important. Especially when they are bigoted. 

You, in whatever core self you hold to to true, are valid. You are real. You are trusted. You are loved. You deserve to exist, openly and honestly. You also don’t owe anyone an explanation at all, ever. 

I’m so sorry you had to experience OP. You’re dealing with trauma, and that’s very real. Know you are not alone ♥️
That sounds terrifying, I'm so sorry this happened. Stay safe and remember this is a reflection of your brother's shittiness and not the treatment you deserve from family or anyone else.
Even though this happened a month ago, I give you full permission to beat his ass the next questionable thing he says.
Sorry you had to deal with that; what an asshole.
He knows nothing of your situation. His words are empty when he hasn't lived a day in your life. You know who you are.
That’s not family worth keeping. Sincerely, someone who left theirs
hi there, im so sorry this happened to you. it’s a very gut wrenching place to be in, and i totally understand as i also come from a SUPER conservative family. publically, i have been out and using they/them pronouns for about 3ish years, but personally to my direct family, i don’t think it’s worth it to come out and try to make them understand. While I totally support the option of fully being yourself around anyone, even your fam; I also support staying quiet about it to them. i, personally find it very harmful to be in a toxic situation like that. My method of coping (though it might not be the best tactic), is to just let it lie. The time may come where it is safe to be your true self, but right now it seems like is isn’t. Confide in your younger brother and sister, but stay safe. I really hope this isn’t the same for you, but i don’t think i will ever come out to my parents. for me, it’s not worth the arguments, the guilt trips, and the mental trauma, to try to explain it to people who are literally unwilling to understand. they don’t define you, as much as they would like to. no matter what happens, everything is a learning experience and a chance to grow. you’re an incredible individual with an incredible life. stay strong, stay safe, friend ♥️
Place a thumbtack in the front seat of his car, and wait for him to notice~
Hey! I have a very similar experience. My brother has pretty awful mental issues and was very susceptible to the alt right pipeline. I’ve dealt with many yelling matches over the years bc eventually (probably after leaving home) you will want to come out. You’ll get through this and I know from experience that hearing “it gets better after high school” doesn’t help but- it DOES get better! If your brother doesn’t want to support you, you have the right to not be around him. Ultimately it’s his fault if your relationship suffers, but it’s a better alternative than you suffering in silence. I hope you get to leave and live your truth!
All I’m saying is hammers and kneecaps were meant to be together
i’m so sorry 😣 i hope you find a more loving environment soon ♥️♥️♥️
It sucks, but at least you know where you stand with him and are still relatively safe.
When he later asks why you cut him off, just remind him of those words.
He's absolutely right. He won't have a genderqueer sister. He won't have you as a sibling at all with his attitude, because you, a nonbinary person, won't be in his life when you are old enough to make that choice.

*Editted for grievous lack of proofreading
All I hope is that he changes the way he thinks in general. I can't understand why people have such hatred in their heart for someone they don't even understand and know nothing about how they feel.
This hurts my heart and soul for you😔. I'm super sorry that you have to hide who you are with the people who should be the most supportive of you and who you really are. 🫂 We don't get to choose the families we're born to, but at least we can choose who we keep, and who we make our family with as we grow older. You are loved and you are always accepted somewhere, I'm just sorry that your home isn't your safe place.
Throw the whole brother away.
Well he can fuck RIGHT off with that bullshit.
I'm so sorry. What a prick.

Hopefully you'll be able to safely live on your own someday and be rid of him.

Until then, stay strong. 💖
I'm so sorry your parents other child is an asshole.

 You matter and you're valid no matter that bullshit comes out of his mouth. You deserve people who will do more than the bare minimum of supporting and respecting you, but will also celebrate you, and you'll eventually find it when you can move out and can cut contact with anyone who chooses to use the bar for bare minimum for limbo practice.
He deserves to step on legos the rest of his life.
That's absolutely fucking horrifying, all I can hope is that he comes to his senses soon enough and grows up
one hell of a wanker. i can’t exactly sympathise with you- the worst I’ve had it is that my mum cannot understand my gender because she believes that gender = sex rather than gender ≠ sex and she says she will not ever understand being nb. oh well, it’s not her fault. 
you have my best wishes and i hope everything gets sorted out soon. your brother is a piece of shit. :D
Ah almost none of my family is supportive either, a lot of them use slurs and talk about how non-binary is “made up” and “not real”. I don’t talk to any of them anymore but it still sucks that the people that are suppose to love and care about you won’t accept the real you
I Hope you have supportive people in ur life and if you don’t I’m here for u <3
Sorry but I would’ve clocked him in the jaw the second that slur came outta his mouth- wouldn’t even let him finish his sentence. I can’t stand that shit. I’m so sorry about your situation :(
I hope you get the support you need, and sorry the way this happened ❤️
i feel your pain and fear so deeply and it sounds so painful, especially when it’s coming from someone you’re presumably around so often. i just need you to know there are so many people who support the hell out of you and love you so much. there are subreddits if you’d like them where you can speak to someone for parental advice and affirmations (i don’t remember the names but can go get them) and i always tell myself when it comes to shitty family that you know their arguments and beliefs aren’t based on reality, most of them  are based of their perception of religion and easily digestible arguments. they aren’t putting in effort for you and aren’t open minded so don’t waste your time, use that time building up yourself and your chosen and found family. sorry for the ramble it’s 2 am and my brain is shortcircuiting from tiredness so i don’t know if anything i said made sense 😭 i just want you to know you aren’t alone out there and it will get better, and i know that that’s such an unsatisfying answer to so much pain but you just need to tough everything out for as long as it takes to leave such a hostile environment. you’ll always find people who will love you so much (jesus christ this paragraph is a mess)
What an asshole. I’m sorry that happened. I’m in a similar situation and I’m just waiting to be older so I can move out
I am really sorry that this happened to you. I hope you have people you do feel safe around and show you respect. Take care of yourself.
DAMN- with the ""Good, cause I'm not having a gender queer sister,"" that just hurts dude. Hope things end up in your favor.
He be acting like he owns the house and you owe him or smtg? This guy doesn’t know his place. He be acting like Iran Islamist police with his pseudo conservative American “values” that are nothing but oppressive. I’m sorry you have to deal with him.
I’m sorry your brother is trash. I know how hard it can be with family. My one set of grandparents just told me “You’re still our grand daughter” and went on to say “All this weird new stuff, what happened to just gay or straight”. That sucked and all but not as bad as half my family being “accepting” but still only uses she/her and daughter/aunt/woman and it almost hurts more.
Wow that dude sounds like a fucking loser
your older brother is a hoe!
Dm me his address. I wanna have a long discussion.
How old is he?
My toxic trait is wanting to fistfight people like your brother; it would be nuclear war in my household if a sibling or parent of mine were blatantly homophobic.
Share ur experiences if you're comfortable, that's the point of this subreddit, love. Take care of urself <3
Sadly, I can't exactly cut him out. We live under the same roof atm. Can't wait to move out so I can literally never talk to any of them ever again lol. Thank you so much, take care of urself <3
Thank you so much! Take care of urself!  <3
My older sister doesn't share his views, she tries to be accepting when she can. I came out to her a little while ago and we haven't spoken about the whole non binary thing since. 

I'd never come out to my family, they wouldn't exactly kick me out (even though that sounds great tbh) but they would never call me they/them. I have a trans younger brother and no one called him he/him accept for me and his twin sister. I told my little brother about me being non binary and that was kinda it. We don't talk about that kinda stuff in my house. (My mum literally justified herself for misgendering my little brother by saying ""that will always be my little girl"" or something). 

Just thought I'd share, I couldn't stop thinking about it. 
On the bright side, it's a tie for positive and negative coming out's lol. 

Thank you so much, take care of urself <3
> At the very least radicalized beyond basic decency of humanity.

This is the major fucking problem. People like him aren't turning out like this in a vacuum. They've been molded by propaganda to spread hate and be hateful, told lies about LGBTQ people, just to generate an overzealous voter base that'll never consider switching sides and fight against us until the death.

He might be a POS but he's an expected result from what we've seen in conservative news.
Thank you so much! Means a lot to me <3 take care of urself
That's easy, I only have to wait about 40 seconds 😅
Thank you so much <3 means a lot. Take care of urself!
Well done for leaving urs, can't wait to leave mine. They've done nothing but cause trauma, pain and guilt 😊 
Take care of urself <3
I totally understand, I will never come out to all of them. And I completely agree, don't come out until you're comfortable and safe. Stay safe, take care of urself <3
He doesn't drive 😭 but he does have like a gamer chair >:)

I was going to say I’ll come punch him the face.
What a sweet, sweet crack
Thank you so much <3 take care of urself
Yepp, and thank fuck for that. Take care of urself <3
He wonders why we literally never talk
He won't even have a sibling the way this is going 😅 thank you so much, take care of urself <3
I think that's why he had that hatred, because he doesn't understand. But he has so much hatred that you can't make him understand. We both hope for the same thing. Take care of urself <3
Thank you so much, that was so sweet. Take care of urself <3
If he's trash, that poor bin

Thank you so much, you too! <3
Honestly, it didn't hurt me that much. Frankly, that's the nicest thing I thought he'd say.
Yep, pretty much. Take care of urself<3
He's the mum of the guy who threw the paper! He a hoe!
Nice long chat, over a coffee
29...and I'm 16
Can ur family adopt me? I'm queer, non binary and I can be a great domestic mf. And I don't take up much space
I'm guessing your parent/s aren't much better?

This isn't something you can have a parent talk to him about, right? Like quit throwing hate around under their roof
It gets better. (Hugs)
nah dont put it on his chair, hide it in one of his shoes for extra damage
Oh god, typos. 🤦‍♀️ so sorry. Fixing.
Yeah, it's sad to think about but only hope. You take as well!
thanks, you too my friend :)
You too! :)
Definitely has a ton of growing up to do. Know that people who hate themselves and their lives can’t stand people who are authentically happy. If you feel like he would hurt you if he found out, I would definitely have a safety plan. Door locks, hiding weapons, having a way to escape etc. Call the cops if he ever threatens you or becomes aggressive. I would look online for local resources like a safe space for trans folx. If you can’t find it in person I recommend online. Talking to a professional social worker or counselor would if possible would be ideal. You don’t have to engage with him. I don’t know the situation well enough to know if he would be violent but your safety is priority. Otherwise I would avoid him until he leaves or you leave. He definitely needs some help.
My mum is one of those mums who's like ""supportive"" so a bunch of Facebook mums are like ""omg, you're so brave"" or whatever. And my dad's a Catholic so you can guess where that goes.
Put lego in his socks and wait, the singular blocks
As really bad as it sounds, I've already looking into that kinda stuff. I was always uncertain of my gender but had my proper identity crisis during quarantine. I've seen that he isn't very fond of my little brother but he hasn't physical done anything to him really, he's just scared him but even then he hasn't done that since social services have been involved with my family. Idk if that's because of my trans little brother or because both him and my older brother have mental issues that go alone with it but I digress. When I figured out that I might not be a cis and I thought, I panicked. So I came up with safety plans incase well, anyone in my family found out. They're pretty big mothed individuals.

It's the older generations of my family that are the most difficult, but some of them are kinda turning around but it's only for my little brother. For Christmas, it warmed me that all my family got him ""grandson"" and ""son"" and ""nephew"" and ""brother"" Christmas cards. But my older brother didn't sign his brother Christmas card, it just had the rest of our names in it. 

Thank you so much <3 I really appreciate it :) take care of urself!
Hmm... You think your mum would get him to stfu? Like ""if you're supportive, why dont you tell so and so he can't talk shit under your roof""
My mum has told him to stfu when he called my younger brother the t slur but that's about it"	zbgey9	NonBinary	879	0.99	2022-12-03 13:33:38
I enjoyed my first Boston Pride Parade yesterday! I have some very interesting sunburns...		"Omg you look SO CUTE
I have a black mesh dress kind of like that shirt but with slightly larger holes. And I wanna wear it to the beach as a cover up or something but the tan lines would be odd. But it's so cute.
Cute! The interesting sunburns are worth it though, right? 😂
Your eye makeup is so perfect for pride!
I marched with a bunch of people from work. In the week leading to Pride we had a couple get-togethers to discuss it. Lots of excited talk about how fun it was and how great it was to be in an accepting atmosphere and yada yada. 

But one guy was like ""real talk, that stuff is all great but also be sure you bring bottled water and wear sunscreen."" He's my hero.
My god, you are cute!
Also i'm so glad you got to go! I've always wanted to but we don't have such a thing where I'm from!
omg i love itttttt! would watch this makeup tutorial cause YOU'RE A GENIUS
You look amazinggg! Please be careful with non eye safe glitter near your eye though! The wrong kind of glitter can do a lot of damage to ur eyes if they get in them!
Wow you’re stunning!! Boston pride is amazing this year.
I was also at Boston Pride!! Hope you had a great time!
AHHHHH UR SO ADORABLE

I was at the pride parade on Saturday, it was my first ever one and seeing so many gays and lesbians and trans boys and girls and enbies and just every shade of queer imaginable was AMAZING!
I love it!!! I am so glad you had a good time.
You're adorable!!
You look so good!!
So awesome!!!
Agh, I love the look! Reminds me of a young me lol
You look so cute
OP you look so great!! :)
Totally worth the sunburns.
That's some serious makeup skill :P
Thank you!! I had such a wonderful time. I'm originally from the south so just seeing the huge crowds of LGBT people old and young alike nearly made my cry from happiness.
Oh definitely <3 Though the fishnest sunburns make it look like someone ran me over with a BMX bike
I'm not great on camera but I might do a photo tutorial! It was actually super easy; I got a 7$ rainbow palate from Ulta and some glitter from Claire's. I used some light eyeshadow primer, did one color at a time, then used eyelash glue to set the glitter!
I was very careful! I did my best to get just up to my lower lid and sealed it really well to keep it from going anywhere
Happiness is a rainbow.

Also, I love the ears!
I can't get over the sparkly gay tears omfg I wish I looked like you
🤣🤣
Yay! Hope I didn’t com off as condescending! I just know a lot of ppl who have had glitter related eye incidents and wanna make sure everyone is being super queer while also bein safe!
My fiancee and I's pet names for one another are Kitten and Bun so I tend to collect cat-themed accessories \~
I've shed a lot of tears in my journey of self expression and acceptance, but the tears shed that day were definitely happy <3
I appreciate your concern!!!
well fuck me up god damnit
Could I share your image and this comment with a Facebook group I run? It's called Frenbies and it's legit just enbies who are friends. I think they'll love it.
Absolutely!
Tysm. I can blur yr face if you want
Nah, you're good, I don't mind :) I already posted my face here so it's out in the internet now XD
The internet is lucky"	byy19b	NonBinary	865	1.0	2019-06-10 13:45:03
ik i missed coming out day and i dont rlly have anyone to come out to but im tryin to b prideful this year so here goes: my name is kylan and i am nonbinary and aroace and my favorite color is white sorry if thats basic haha		"You don't need to apologize for who you are or what you like! ""Basic"" is just a way to shame people for what they like.
White is literally every colour ever. So not really basic.

Also, I LOVE your hoodie. Do you think there's a chance it's available in Germany?
That hoodie looks awesome! 

Its about to start getting cold where I am, think I might need one!
omg thank u all ur so nice, yes i love this hoodie too i found it at a thrift store, i hope my rats love it too
you look so good!
Hey Kylan, I love your look. Coming out can be really hard but I've got faith you'll be able to someday soon ❤
I love your hair. You look fly af
You should have all the pride in the world! You’re stunning. Own it ^^
My friend, WHERE did you obtain that marvelous hoodie??? It looks like everything I need and more
You are supported ! 🤘🎉
You look so cute. Maroon is your color
Hiiiiiiii! My name is Kyland and I also sort of recently came out hahaha! You look great and that hoodie does indeed look very great!
you're so cute!!! happy late coming out day! <3
Cute hair! I love it.
Slay
Adorable!
Welcome to being out! Do glad you feel safe enough to do it here! We love you
Can you get my keys out of my car triple A?
I missed coming out day too! And my favorite colour is Pastel green, thanks for asking
basic or not, I refuse this to be denied: you look amazing and I am proud of you
Cute :3
thanl u all so much 🥰
Awe friend lookin as blessed and fluffy as ever u go! I'm proud of you and you're accepted 👏
thanks pal i just rlly like white its so nice and soft i wanna have white hair
When you don't like it anymore, can I have it? /s 

I don't want to buy new clothes for some time, but /r/wasletztepreis, 2nd hand shops and flea markets are mind resource hungry.
o ive come out but i am kinda going nack into the closet at least to the public bc its just hard.. but thank u
thank u uvu
at salvation army haha, i even considered not getting it but then i tried it on and couldnt not buy it
thank u!!!
thank u i agree i used to have maroon hair but now im more into white, but i love maroon colored clothes c:
o thank u lol such similar names c:
thank uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
Nice & soft = what I aspire to
Ohhhh I gotchu, yeah presenting as you want in public can be really tough.

Awe ofc xx
The light blonde youve got in your hair looks good so if you went white I think it would look really good with maroon clothing too. Live your best life surrounded by things you like and as a part of your creative expression.
no prob! :) have a good day!
u as well uvu"	dgvwek	NonBinary	871	1.0	2019-10-12 14:33:29

You're serving❤️
Good for you.  You look great.

I am 54 and just starting to recognize I might be non binary.  Great to see older role models.
Love the look and how you pull it off. You are goals!
Please have hope. Thank you for your kind words.
Thank you for your kind words. And have no doubt: being older and queer rules!

been cutting my own hair for 9 years :) it's a source of pride and major gender euphoria		"**I love it**! Everything about you and this photo is just *chefs kiss*! <3
As someone who just took clippers to their own hair for the first time ever two nights ago, **how**? Like, I am super elated to reclaim bodily autonomy, and I think the whole ""DIY crip punk ain't scared of no glare"" thing fits with the rest of my aesthetic, but seriously, I wasn't going for that ragged a look. Also, A+ bi lighting, that's a great portrait.
Please cut my hair?? 😂
Wow, I’ve also cut my own hair a lot over the years (especially this year), but it’s never looked that good!!! You’re a legend!
Your hair looks so cool!
Bro, your hair is just too fucking perfect!
I love your hair! I pity your right eyeball though, prolly gettin stabbed by your bangs like mine ;_;
It’s so fluffy and animated!
Your hair looks like it is full of secrets and I love it
You remind me of the Sprouse twins!
you look like a cyberpunk character I love it
That's amazing!! I would definitely screw it up if I tried to cut my own hair 😂 but my husband gave me my first undercut (and he's done several maintenance ones)
1. Love your hair cut!  Well done
2. It is wonderful to know I'm not the only one cutting my own hair for gender euphoric reasons - it is so much fun!
You look like a techno king lol
You're very attractive!
I love it! 💜💜💜
Wow I've been cutting my own hair for about 2 years but have never gotten a look so good! I'm afraid to try a fade, any advice?
The lighting in this pic is PERFECT
It looks like you're struggling not to let out a great big smile - Euphoria for sure! :D I did it too. I've been cutting my hair off and on for a long time and this last time I did it it felt rejuvenating. For thick hair when it gets warmer out, thinning shears make a huge difference for me.
Omg thought twinsies! I saw this gorgeous photo and came to say 😚👌
Cheers to the breathtaking human!!!!
I came to the comments to see if bi lighting was mentioned. Was not disappointed"	ly58nm	NonBinary	825	1.0	2021-03-05 05:47:05

Damn that's some fabulous hair. Happy pride!!!
Happy Pride! Also, my hair wants to be your hair when it grows up.
Happy Pride!

And your hair is absolutely gorgeous!
Happy pride to you too! I have to ask, how do you style your hair? My hair looks really similar but it's always just *flat* do you put a lot of work into that?
Happy Pride! Your eyebrows and your hair though, seriously ❤️
happy pride month! i love the fit <3
Aahhhhhhhh hair goals 😍  love it
Happy pride!!! Love your hair🖤💛💜🤍
Love your hair!
Did you just step out onto Pride Rock? Because that glorious mane of yours gives me life-- And it moves us aaaall

So cute.

May I ask who the artist of the Japanese print is?
Nice wig, nice septum clicker, and a damn good makeup job. And that's also one fucking nice kitty right there.
So cute! 💙💗I saw someone with cotton candy hair at my local gas station, wasn't sure if it was trans pride or not
You're cute, your cat is cute... and I see Hisoka on your first pic! Everything is awesome!
GORGEOUS
You and your cat are adorable.
I'm so jelly

I absolutely love this, and I love the hyena rep and I’m also non binary so this is like super relevant to me lmaoo. As the name states!
It’s gorgeous! 💛🤍💜
I think this is the first time I've actually liked the nonbinary colors!
Omg I love this! The fact you used spotted hyenas is amazing. I wish humans were more like spotted hyenas (not their birth canal/cavity though that's for sure 🤣) the fact that gender norms don't apply to them is so intriguing.
Fisi mbili wanakula smoothie za blueberry.

That's Swahili.

This is brilliant btw. As an enby with a particular love for East Africa, this made my day :) Thanks!! I've been on a safari before and seen hyenas in the savannah and it makes me smile to imagine tourists driving by slowing in a Land Rover being confused as to why two hyeanas are pigging out on blueberry smoothies.
this is awesome !
Awwww I love them
Absolutely love this 💞
I love this! You should definitely make prints :)
I love it here
I really like your style
THIS IS AWESOME

Hyenas are my favorite animal, and this fucking slaps

This is lovely!
I really like this painting. It's SO pretty. And the NB rep is on point! Great use of color, animal, and fun. Hyenas are awesome. Always reminds me of the Lion King. I can hear Ed laughing while eating a blueberry smoothie (I know they weren't spotted Hyenas, but I can pretend).
Wait this is so cool and epic
This looks like a fever dream, I love it
GAJHKHJFDKSDFN their faces. I love them so much OP
Permission to print this out and frame it??
Love it. Yeah I feel nicely represented. Gives me a new perspective on the colors in a positive way!
kind stranger who gave me silver, I hope you see this, thank you!! it's my first silver, thank you very much!! QuQ <3 <3
OP can I kiss them?
ahhhh that makes me so happy to hear!! That's what I hope for, that it makes my fellow queer people happy, that's why I'll keep painting this series! I'm so glad you like it! <3 <3 <3

the first Pride was a riot. we have what we have today because of a Black trans woman. everybody stay safe out there. BLM and ACAB, always.		"I thought ACAB meant Assigned Cool at Birth and I'm so stealing that now
Well I'll have to research this because it sounds FUCKING AWESOME and I'm proud to have and honor that heritage.
🤘
The first Pride was a riot and no one can buy it!
Great message and great hair
What dost thou yearn for?
Suh dude congrats
All cops? Even the ones who put down their riot gear & marched with legitimate protesters? The ones feeding & assisting the protesters?

https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/us/flint-michigan-protest-police-trnd/index.html

https://globalnews.ca/news/7008678/police-join-george-floyd-protesters/

If we assume ACAB, we won't have *desperately needed allies* our fight against bad policing (or against Trump if he decides to interfere with a free election in November). 

It's like saying, ""All Protesters Are Bad"" because there are rioters & looters taking advantage of a shitty situation.

* Full disclosure, I used to live in one of the MPLS neighborhood that we all keep seeing on the news. Walking distance from the overrun precinct & burned business. I'm angry at the asshole cops, the thin blue line that protects them, and the people who won't allow this to be a peaceful protest.
I originally thought it meant ""assigned cop at birth""
Yep Marsha P Johnson.
pretty dope. gays and ""crossdressers"" parties in bars owned and protected by mafia bc they didn't care who patroned the bars so long as protection moneys got laid. however the cops finally got they and started raiding gay bars. One hot hot summer in 1969, we finally fought back. Marsha P. Johnson, a black trans woman sex worker, threw the first brick at cops raiding the Stonewall Pub. 5 days of riots followed.
yes, all cops. when you sign up to be a cop, you are getting paid to enforce a deeply corrupt and racist system. cops marching with protesters is purely performative.
All cocks are beautiful.
Same. What does it actually mean?
the first brick is the source of much controversy, even Marsha herself didn't take full credit for that

**edit: i think it was kinda metaphorical?  lol.
I really thought it meant “A cool Awesome Bitch” at first
Agreeeeeed
All cops are bad/bastards
To be honest I don't vibe strongly with this sentiment? There are a *lot* of bad cops out there (disturbingly many), but the problem isn't to do with them being cops, it's to do with them being racists. There are non-cop racists that have tried to turn peaceful protests into violent ones to get them to shut down too, and there are a small number of good cops out there. Police brutality is still real though, definitely not disputing that.
It's not about the individual cops but rather how the system is broken and how the cops that would be considered good cops don't hold the bad ones accountable
Ah, that makes sense."	gucs5n	NonBinary	770	0.97	2020-06-01 03:07:11
A family member has rampantly misgendered and deadnamed me at 2 events despite people being there using the correct name, so I used their graduation gift to buy binders. They arrived yesterday right in time for the start of Pride month!		"Ayyye recently said fuck it and bought my very first bi, nb, and demisexual flags!! They be arriving later this week and I plan on keeping them in my room for now. I won't be able to hang them up due to homophobic family members but at least I'll have them ready when I'm in a safer place. Now I just gotta work on getting myself some binders : DD
That is iconic. Also great pic and the binder is fantastic!
I LOVE the binder, you look fantastic! I'm so sorry about your family member, you deserve better than that. But good job doing that for you!
They say the best revenge is living well <3
Good job
I conic
I loveeeee this! Good for you :)) Also, this is probably the cutest binder I've ever seen.
And that’s called “fuck you” haha
You are such a legend for this!
Excellent choice! Happy Pride!!
I just bought a rainbow binder too, and I love it so much!
eyyy, a fello bi, demi, enby! yo!"	nql5jn	NonBinary	766	1.0	2021-06-02 12:55:52

Everyone just knows me as male at home/work, which is cool with me, but kinda sucks when you feel fem some days :/ at least i got you guys here! 😁💙
Hell yes friend slaying today 🙌🏼
I said ""awww"" out loud
Also I adore your lil eyebrows and I'm constantly on the verge of doing it to my own eyebrows but I'm a coward
That whole outfit is goals! It has my favorite colors, it has elements of multiple styles while remaining unique, and you rock it perfectly.
You look gorgeous my friend 🥰
Cute
You look super cute and happy! I’m happy for you!
:o gorgeous. Very lovely person :D.
I MEAN THIS WITH R E S P E C T, you are looking as slayful as Ariana Grande does!!!!   


THE HAIR... THE EYEBROWS JUST YESSS!!! THE OUTFIT, THE EYELINER... YESSSS!!!  


Bro I need those eyebrows pleaseeeeeee! Also personally I say fringe.   
I'D KICK A CHILD FOR THE EYEBROWS.
Super tasteful. Im the same way with thick makeup- not a fan. It came out nice and subtle but you look great! Absolutely slaying it!
This is absolutely precious oh my goodness gracious 🥺✨
Omg you look adorable :)
That’s great mate! And you look great!
Nope. Not allowed. Way too cute. Can't cope with so much  ~adorable~

Honesty, either way is very cute but I love the bangs
I love the fringe! You look so cute!
You are adorbs!
Omg, I mean this in the best way possible, you look like Vanellope from wreck-it-Ralph! Like your smile is so cute and adorable >.< I love the eyeliner and everything about these pics! Have fun!
I love your look! ❤️ Your make up looks perfect and so pretty! Btw im so jealous of greenish/greyish eyes! I cant really tell the color but you have beautiful eyes! ❤️
You look amazing!!❤️

Love itttt. The eyeliner is gorgeous, and so are you! (I'm a fan of the fringe!)
Omg you look so cool!!!!! You look like you need to be the main character is some cyber punk drama 😎
I hope someone kissed you cuz that’s an adorable face 😘
You look so good as a fellow femme. That little overbite is so freakin adorable and oh god, that cheek dimple… 😍💛🤍💜🖤
aw thank you!! 😊 I have no idea what you'd call this lol, colourful goth?
thanks! 😁it's been quite a while since I've been able to go out in a dress so yes i am happy haha
haha yeah i can see that tbf!
So I'm not the only one who saw it LMAO
ty!! 💙 im in love with this dress lol
hehe thankss! 😊💕
I shaved my head a couple months ago, if you want to do it.... do it!   


WOOOOO!!!!! I legit would kick a child for their eyebrows.
DO IT lol i have no regrets, I've had them like this for months now (it grows back anyways, so it's not a big deal) i love my little nubs
thank you!! i recently have become a bit obsessed with blue and orange lol. Funny cos I really use to not like orange but now I love 🧡
LMAO thank you so much!! 💙

definitely get yourself some eyebrow shaving razors if you don't have them! changed my lifee
honestly not seen the film but i just googled her and yes!! i totally see what you mean, I am kinda stunned how spot on she is! Well, if I had a ponytail and was like... 20 years younger lol

thank youu!! 😊💙
Thank you!! 💙 haha they are like a sage green i think you'd call it ☺️
thank you!! 😊💙
thanks!! 😊💙 I like both lol couldnt decide, went with the tied back version in the end
Thankss!! 💙 lol i love the cyber punk style actually! i like way too many things so i created this mash up
Gothic bright? the cheery side of death and depression lol
It's definitely the teeth in the second pic that do it, imo
i second this, my other half has a buzz cut now and it's 👌🏻🔥 plus you can bleach and dye the heck out of it with whatever colours you want. I drew a rainbow around my partners head last month

i would def recommend these little 'eyebrow shaving razors' you can get, so easy to do it with those
You're welcome! 😊 Ah okay well you have very pretty sage green eyes lol ❤️ I would so love to have different colored eyes other than just normal brown 😑
Love that!! I hope you keep posting all of the cool outfits you put together!!!
lol yeahh i have a super obvious overbite, I've learnt to love it as I get older tho
aww thank you 😊 i will try haha, this was a bit of a happy accident
It's charming! I love the Jade vibe"	w67ysu	NonBinary	735	1.0	2022-07-23 16:26:51

Me and Luna say: non-binary autistic pride! 🧡 (Agender/any pronouns) - I swear she's comfortable and loves it		"Ugh, your hair is absolutely stunning! 😍 love the shirt and tatoos as well, your whole vibe is great! Luna has very pretty eyes 🖤
You look gorgeousss <3.<3 Absolutely love the hair and shirt by the way and Luna looks adorable heheheee <3<3<3

Also I can't help but mention that you look like Klaus from Umbrella Academy, highly reccommend the watch if you haven't already :D

Edit: Just to clear up some confusion, Klaus' actor stated specifically that the character was an enby, so this isn't an attempt at misgendering. Have a great day :DDDD
You are both very cute!
💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜💜 autistic nonbinary pride ,!!
do you-DO YOU HAVE HER TATTOOED ON YOUR HAND?? IN A MOON SHAPE??? BECAUSE HER NAME IS LUNAAA
Omg what cuties!!! I love your hair and your shirt! And those tattoos are so cool! Very good vibes ❤️
Beautiful human, beautiful cat. 10/10 all round. 

Didn't know that much cute could be contained in one photo but there you both are.

Edit - just noticed that your neck tattoo is of a fern and a monstera deliciousa, now I'm dead.
Others already said it, but gotta say your tattoos are awesome! The one on the neck especially looks very cool.
You look amazing!!
What products do you use on your hair? I have similar curls but struggle managing them. Wish I could make them look like that!
Two cuties! 😁❤️

Happy Pride month, fam! I randomly selected some users and painted their portraits!		"pinging 
u/SimplyMoono, u/viconightpiece, and u/cardboardmansion

hope this isn't weird or anything lol

I've wanted to do this for some time and it's something I'd totally do again! This corner of the internet is my jam and everyone on this subreddit is fantastic! 

Plus, I'm having my top surgery tomorrow so why not
this is amazing, wish i could paint like this!!!
I love your style! I’m struggling atm to draw every day.
That's pretty sweet, I like the lighting!
I love these! Check out my post history for lots of queer art 💕
Ayo, this is rad dude!!
Woah this is very nice!!!
This is great!
Happy pride month! What lovely, smooth art. I love it. You captured the mood of those pictures perfectly, and gave them so much personality! Are you taking commissions?
Oh my god this is the cutest thing ever! Thank you so much I love it!
Holy shit im honored :,) you’re extremely talented and a preemptive congratulations on your top surgery!! I hope everything goes perfect!
 OMGOMGOMGOMGOMG !!!!!!!!!!! This is so good, thank you SO MUCH! And congrats on the surgery! ❤❤❤

As Wings Over Scotland’s troupe of the Scottish gender critic movement are attempting to dogpile me on Twitter, (Failing because I’m funnier than them) I have mounted my new Pride flag to my ceiling.		"I bet they are totally in bed with the Tories. Massive mask off moment for the Abla crew.
Oh Demi boooooy, the TERFS, the TERFs are maaaalding...
✨Unironed flags are gay culture 🏳️‍🌈 (also my disabled ass totally understands putting that on the ceiling was probably event.) Lookin awesome, can’t wait to come out so I can do that too 🤍
Get ‘em ! Queer liberation now
Amazing... Where do you all get your pride flags btw? XD

I have to get one sometime soon too
I'm sorry that Scotland has been blocked by Westminster asshats. I hope this island stops being so terfy someday sooner than later. 😮‍💨

But also nice on you for not letting twatter idiots get you down!
I love the nonbinary colors and congrats on the new flag! Don’t have any in my house due to close minded family issues but still glad to see them in other peoples spaces!
iron it
All due love, respect, and validation OP, BUT BY BAKER IRON YOUR FLAG! (Signed the Queer Vexillology Community)
fucking pop off, monarch! ⚡️🌈✨️ also, as a fellow disabled entity, i too refuse to iron my flags.

and all this ""iron your flag"" shit in this thread feels vaguely bootlick-y to me.
Day 9763 of asking fellow queers to iron their flags
Steam iron it
Yay flags! I have three on my walls already 😁
The fact they claim to fight for Women's Rights and then team up with the Scottish Family Party is laughable.
From Them to Them, and down the rainbow sliiiiiiiiiide...
Best of luck with coming out whenever you’re ready!!
This one came from Amazon, as well as the bi one I’ve got coming. I’ve got a little rainbow one from the protest in Edinburgh on Thursday, and my bf has a bi one on a stick from last Glasgow Pride.

I used to have a pansexual one but I stopped going by that for simplicity, idk where it is now, but that was Amazon too.
Thanks!  


I hope you find your way out of that environment soon!
Effort
It's on the ceiling now and I'm disabled so no
Whose boots are they licking??
*PLEASE*
Thx a lot <3 :)
fair enough
It might be enough to just make it wet and let it dry  straight (pun not intended)
What If I ask really really nicely?
Fair enough, carry on living your best life OP.
The steam iron mafia /s
Obviously someone with a home decor/fabric kink who simply can not handle wrinkles. (/heavy sarcasm)
it reminds me of the ppl who get pissed when their national flag touches the ground. where i'm from, those ppl are all pro-cop and pro-military. i said it ""feels vaguely boot-licky"" not ""omg these commenters are consensually participating in a bootlicking kink.""

it'a messed up to ride in and tell someone to iron their own flag, is my point. /gen
If you come over, take it down, do it for me and put it back up, sure.  


It was v painful for me to do so and took a lot out of me so I'm happy with it
Fair enough"	10hrm7m	NonBinary	672	1.0	2023-01-21 13:46:55
Went to my first pride!		"You look great and looks like you had so much fun!!!

The painted hearts look so good! 💜 What paint did you use?
Nice 😁 what's the flag on your left cheek? I recognize the non-binary one, of course, but not the other one
The face paint ahhh🥰 you look so cute!
You look beautiful, mate! I hope you had as much fun as it looks like you did!!
I'm getting a classic, classy vibe from that. In a good way! 👍
I did! It was amazing. Thank you so much ❤️
Thank youuuu 💗

It was supposed to be a genderfluid flag but since I only got such colours it's kinda messed up 😅

At the Bi+ Pride Community Celebration	Today in Melbourne Australia was the Bi+ Pride community event, it was good to reconnect after lockdowns etc, anyway it was made possible by funding from the state government through its Pride fund	"wow you look great!!! that dress is very pretty and you look so happy:D
It's always so affirming and inspirational to see older bi folk living their best lives -- Happy Pride!

These legs are made for Marching. So thats just what they'll do! First time shaving! Happy Pride yall! ❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤		"Happy pride 🏳️‍🌈
daaaaang looks like you did a great job! (first time i shaved my legs i cut myself like 47 times lol) Happy pride!
First time? Are you sure? You don't look like the Cenobites have been at your legs for five minutes... 😉
It's so freeing and comfortable! I never want to go back now that I've started shaving. Rock them proudly! 🏳️‍🌈
Your legs looks really great !  
I depilate my legs for the first time a week ago. Really painful but I like my legs for the first time.  
Happy pride !
That first time was so magical :D

These days I'm lazy and mostly use an electric shaver, but nothing really compares to a proper shave.
In March we march for our rights

In June we march with pride and rights
Have fun lying on the sofa stroking your legs for the next few hours giggling happily?
Ngl, when you mentioned marching I thought you meant marching band bc I'm in marching band. I forgot about the pride marches somehow."	o0ddmt	NonBinary	625	1.0	2021-06-15 12:38:37
My customized nonbinary pride converse 🥰		"I fucking love this. so goddamn much.
Those are so cool!
Dope as heck
How do I get a pair of these
Oh okay wow, I fucking need these 😍
Those are fresh as fuck!!!!!
The tongue of the shoe on the right is dyed pinkish because I ironically spilled strawberry Fanta on them 😝
THOSE ARE SO SICK!!!! 💕💕💕💕 I want that! I gotta do that!

How do I do that? 😅
I never knew I needed this in my life
Can't wait to make my own in the spring!
These are awesome! Almost makes me not hate the new enby flag. I really prefer the old genderqueer one, but these chucks are dope for sure 💛🤍💜🖤
***goes to the converse website***
It especially felt good to put ‘valid’ for the embroidered text 😎🥰
Thanks, they also came with a rubber side sole keychain that says ‘Converse x *my name’ and I put my preferred name and it made me so happy. 😄
Go to the converse website and choose custom. You can choose high top, low top, platform etc. It then lets you pick the color for every little thing even the stitching and eyelets. You can copy my design or do your own thing. 😁
They’re a bit pricey at $80, but that’s standard for converse. If you can get the money go for it 👍
Perfect for the strawberries on them!!
There’s an option on the converse website to make custom shoes and choose all the colors of everything; however, it’s come to my attention that they have since taken down quite a few color/pattern options since I made these which sucks. 😣
tbh I missed that but now I love them even more :)
I don't seem to have all of the color options you would have had in order to make these.
For instance the lining only has black, white, and off white options and the ""racing stripe"" only comes in white, black or ""classic red/blue"" among other things that I don't seem to be able to do
Right? Lol. It’s a shame they removed it as a lining option now 😒
Are they not doing different colors per shoe anymore too or can I just not figure that out?
I just checked the website too and I don’t get it. There are about half as many options as there used to be. I’m sorry they changed it since last year, I didn’t mean to get your hopes up. ☹️😖
Hopefully, they'll bring it back sooner rather than later, in the meantime, I'm glad you were able to get your pair when you did!! 💛  🍀👣💜🖤
The shoes are identical, the inside half is yellow and the outsides are purple. It’s a little hard to see from the picture, sorry. 😅
No worries, tho it's odd that they'd drop a bunch of the options 😾
I hope so too. I made them when I was still kind of unsure, but getting these made me really happy. I’m thinking about making an asexual pair and wearing one of each. 😄
Oh god, I really didn’t see that xD that makes much more sense
I’m blaming covid. It’s probably not the entire reason but it makes some sense 😷
I'm glad they made you happy and ooh, I hope you do, I bet an Ace pair would look amazing!! You have such a great eye for design, I think
Thank you ☺️
You're quite welcome!!"	kzh47n	NonBinary	624	1.0	2021-01-17 22:53:29
Nonbinary pride mullet!		"This is so dope! I especially love the colors in the lower strands.
This slaps!!!
I'm rlly trying to figure out if I'd want something like this or not lol. It's so pretty but would gender dysphoria disagree?
Loooooove the look!! 💛💟💜🖤
Your hair looks amazing!
You look damn punk af
You are rocking that mullet! I normally hate them but you can pull it off along with David Bowie
you are gender envy!!

I’m the first (openly) nonbinary person to have received their PhD from my university!!!	"Dear fellow gremlins and others,

I'd like to share my happiness with you!

Long story short, this week I finally defended my PhD thesis in machine learning (online because I managed to catch a cold just a week before the defense :s) and even got a cum laude!!! My university respected my wish to be addressed gender-neutrally during my defense and by my new name, which is not my legal name yet. I’ve put all my pride into the design of my thesis and defense presentation because I could lol, because it’s MY thesis and MY defense, THEREFORE I'M GONNA USE ANY COLORS AND SYMBOLS I WANT, pictures are attached :)

&#x200B;

[ My thesis, printed in 70 copies and distributed in my department. My colleagues' book shelves just needed to be queered up.](https://preview.redd.it/cr8zi758czt91.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ccbb13134d9a0e0d4a0e185d92789ebdaed6c1ad)

You are amazing and an inspiration!! Congratulations and I hope you have something big planned to celebrate cuz this is so awesome!!!
Congrats on your PhD, and on your courage! Thank you for walking, so others can run !!

HUGE CONGRATS!!
DOCTOR GREMLIN!!!!!! CONGRATS SO MUCH FRIEND!!!!!!!
I must say I love how much effort you put into the book, my only criticism, and it's a small one, would be that in my opinion pink text on a blue background just doesn't work. Congratulations on doing this otherwise though.
Yeah. If anyone calls me Miss now I'll be like ""it Dr for ya""
Fuck yeah I'm Dr Gremlin!!! Although, I also like thinking of 'Gremlin' as my honorific, abbreviated as 'Gr.' But one can have multiple titles, such as 'Prof. Dr.', so I'll be a proud Dr. Gr. [Name] [Surname]
Thanks! Yeah, my collegues told me the same, but this was after I printed it.

Nonbinary Flag Cupcakes I made for pride! They're Ube Black Sesame & Lemon (and Gluten-free!) Recipe in the comments		"Recipe and instructions: https://www.madebyshade.com/p/ube-black-sesame-and-lemon-cupcakes
Why am I getting gender envy from a cupcake… these look amazing!
Looks delicious, you're so talented!
These cupcakes look amazing! From one baler to another, have you ever been able to achieve emerald green frosting? My birthday is coming up and thats the color I want for my cake
Adorable, you killed it! You make someone who doesn’t like cupcakes really want to eat one.
They look amazing and the flavors sound delicious! Great work
I want them in my tummy.
Grabby hands*
They look fantastic!!! Good job!!!
[deleted]
They're awesome !you did a great job they look yummy! and also the colors are very well done
Whoa, those are stunning! You’re very talented. How’d they taste?
These look amazing!
They look sooooo goooood!
Holy smokes, fantastic!! Thanks for sharing!
These look fantastic, I want to try it 😍
Haha I love it! Thank you very much!
Thank you so much! 🥰
Thank you! I haven't tried emerald green yet with this technique, but I imagine it would work! After you mix the food coloring with the frosting, microwave it for 10 to 15 seconds and the color should deepen immediately. Whisk it to disperse the color, cover with plastic wrap, and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes or until firm. Then whip it with a hand mixer back to frosting consistency.

I would also recommend a good quality food coloring set. You might need to mix multiple colors to get the right shade you're going for. I use Wilton's Color Right System. It has a little guide in it for achieving different colors. Their neon gels are also really good. You might try incorporating a neon teal with some green to get a more jewel tone. Hope that helps!
Thank you so much! 🥰
Thank you very much! 😊
Thank you! 😁
Let me see if I can help you out! I think the only non-vegan parts of the recipe are the eggs (lemon curd, ube cupcakes) and the butter (everything). I'm pretty confident you could swap the butter in the black sesame filling, cupcakes, and buttercream frosting for vegetable shortening (at a 1-to-1 ratio) without any major problems. The lemon curd I'm less sure about, but there are plenty of vegan lemon curd recipes online that you could make instead! Just make sure it's not too thin or it might soak into the cupcakes when you fill them. And then the eggs in the cupcakes I would suggest swapping for apple sauce (1/4 cup per egg) or some other binder/egg substitute. Hope that helps! Let me know if you make it, I'd love to hear how it turns out. :)
Thanks very much! If you microwave the frostings for about 10 to 15 seconds and then chill them until firm before whipping again, the colors get a lot more vibrant! That's what I did for the purple and black. :)
Thank you so much! They're really moreish, I couldn't stop eating them haha. The ube is subtly sweet, the lemon curd is very bright and zingy, and the black sesame has a nice nutty flavor. The lemon and the sesame play off each other in a very unique way. It's not like anything I've really tasted before so it's kind of hard to describe. Usually my spouse takes leftover baked goods into the office to share, but the two of us ate all of them pretty quickly. 😂
Thank you so much! ❤️
Thank you! 🥰
Thank you!
Thank you! I hope you do!
>Thank you! 😁

You're welcome!
The colors are really vibrant, and the flavors sound really interesting! Will definitely try this when I get home.
Awesome, let me know how they turn out!!"	vj31i3	NonBinary	603	1.0	2022-06-23 18:03:20
Happy 17th day of #Pride2022 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ Today I'm flying the OG Pride Flag and the Pansexual Pride Flag!		"I used to hate labels and flags. Odd thing to hate, since they're mainly used to celebrate almost everyone I love, but something ruined them for me a long time ago. Recently, that hatred melted away thanks to people like you. Mostly strangers, a few good friends, but one shared trait among them all: that radiant smile! It really is a beacon for those of us who get lost in the storm. 

TL;DR - You seem great, and I hope to be a little more like you each day!
Today I'd like to highlight the [Rainbow Parenting podcast](https://refugerestrooms.org/)!


Welcome to Rainbow Parenting, a queer- and gender-affirming parenting podcast. Every week, queer educator Lindz Amer starts conversations about the intimidating first steps on how to affirm queer, trans, and nonbinary kids. 


They talk to experts who explain how to approach age-relevant early childhood sex ed, queer kid lit, gender reveal parties, and much more. And this isn’t just for parents; educators, caregivers, librarians, and anyone who knows, loves, and works with kids can start the process of raising a whole generation!

Made myself a giant sequin non-binary cape for Pride this year		"That is AMAZING!
Oh wow I LOVE this! I was just gonna do a nonbinary flag as a cape but you went above and beyond this looks great!
EPIC
Truly powerful.  Very impressed.
this is sick as hell!!
Glorious!
😍
I have to say that is very impressive work. You got skillz!
This is absolutely awesome and I'd totally wear it.
good on you! It's beautiful too. I wish I had enough confidence to go to pride
So amazing!!!!
that's epic
Ahhh send me your Etsy name!
No words. This is just... wow. I wAnT oNe!!!
So I'm apolitical at best and don't know why reddit popped this sort of thing on my feed, but that being said, this is really good work. Well done. =)
Thanks! I'd been seriously debating whether or not I actually wanted to put all the time and effort into it but I'm so glad I followed through, I love it so much (and it swooshes wonderfully)
Thanks! I did a flag as a cape last year but decided I wanted to be a little more extra this year
If you sold them on Etsy I'd buy one for sure.
Thanks! It's taken a lot of time and practice
Thanks! You should definitely make one for yourself! :) 

(...or buy one from me, I was just convinced to make an Etsy shop XD )
I'm lucky enough to be a part of several Star Wars groups that march in our local Pride parades... I'm not sure I'd have the confidence to go on my own if I wasn't in costume and surrounded by supportive friends. It's not for everyone, especially if you're particularly introverted or not all the way out... I hope someday you'll feel confident enough to go to Pride if you want to 😊
Shop name is SpaceAceFabrications! And feel free to message me either here or there too if you have any questions 😊
I mean... they're on Etsy now 😜 (or you could make your own, if you know how to sew or wanted to learn)
Thanks! 💛💜🖤🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈🌈🌈
How long did it take to make it, if you don’t mind me asking?
Guess that means I should go make an Etsy shop now XD
Thank you qwq Im happy for you
I didn't actually time it, but probably around 10 hours all together (including cutting out fabric and sewing and everything)
Several hours later and I have an Etsy shop with custom pride sequin capes listed XD
Wow! That is some serious dedication.
(unfortunately they're not super cheap... but also they're about $75 worth of material and many hours of work...)
I figured that if I was going to spend any time working it,  I should make it something that was good and will last me for years to come :)
Also, so many sequins shed on my floor... XD
That’s true."	c4qmpw	NonBinary	596	1.0	2019-06-24 16:14:39

I got my nails done for the last day of pride month! <3		"Awesome!
They look great!
Getting mine done tonight. Debating between Bi-flag colors, NB-flag colors, or Pacers Basketball colors. 

I love the Pacers, but their basketball season is over.

Maybe Bi colors on fingernails w/ pacers accent nail and NB on toenails.
Why didn’t I know it was the last dayy, love your nails btw
Well I know what i'm trying after my essay :D
Ooooh I love them!!!
Dude those are awesome
Hell yeah, they look great my fellow nonbinary human 😆

I combined all of my pride flags into one: non-binary, bisexual, polyamorous, and neurodiverse.		"I love this idea!!! Your flag is awesome!
What's the poly part here, if you don't mind? 😊 I'm all those things and planning to steal this... Just kidding... Unless 🤔🤔 /lh /jk
Is the infinity sign the symbol for neurodivergent? Cuz I gotta add that to my collection then.

Or is that the polyarmory part and the gradient means neurodivergent?
Any chance of the same but with the bisexual flag replaced with the omnisexual flag? I hope so. It's a brilliant design.
Dude that is AWESOME! I'm gonna have to do this now.
Love this! That would be my flag too!
I don’t know if dysthymia counts as neurodiverse too, but if it does this is my flag as well 💜😻
Omg this is awesome!! I’ve been making pride flags for autistic people of different identities so I doubly love this~!
We meet again, fellow nb bi poly nd 😊
ight time to steal a bit of that and add a fucking rainbow infinity symbol on mine. Ty
This has great vibes 💚💙💜❤
Wait, that rainbow infinity is for ND in general and not just autism?
OMG ITS ME 🥰🥰🥰
I love it! I hope this isn’t an annoying request, but if it’s not too much trouble, I’d love to have this with the agender flag. I can’t tell whether a bi heart or a pan heart would go better with the agender flag, but I’d be ecstatic to get either!
How do you make these?  Is there a website or program you use?
i am all of these things! :D
This is so cool!
This is a really cool idea and makes me want to do one as well at some point

Mine would probably just be the flag of Libya prior to 2011 (Just green).

/s but it'd be close
wow, a combination flag that actually looks good. cuddos
Woah
[removed]
This is beautiful! I love it!
Such a neat idea, and it looks fabulous!
This is so beautiful. Almost exactly what I would have, but with pan leanings instead of bi.
Lovely
What a fantastic idea!
Oh my God I love this!! This is all me too I love it so much 😭 thank you this is gorgeous. Could I print this and put it up for personal use?
Do you sell these? I'd love to buy one
I love this. May I use it?
Thanks! ☺️
Ditto 😁
The poly part is the heart shape with an infinity symbol in front of it! Very subtle, so honestly I think this flag would work even if you weren't poly. And totally go for it, I shared it so if anyone else finds it useful they can go for it! ☺️
The rainbow infinity sign is the symbol for neurodiversity. A golden infinity sign symbolizes autism, but as I have multiple neurodivergencies I went with the rainbow one!

The poly part is the heart shape + the infinity shape, so the infinity sign kinda works for both meanings (poly / ND).
https://imgur.com/a/pxj03Wi

Here you go! Couldn't find a vector of an Omni heart so I just kind of drew one, I hope it looks okay!
Yes it does! :)
That's so cool! I'd love to see some of your other designs :)
Well well well, look who we have here! Lol
Lol no problem!
Here ya go, here's both!

https://imgur.com/a/u1p9pE3
I use Ibis paint, Canva, and piZap for these.
Imagine thinking anyone cared about your shitty opinions.
Thank you!! I usually find mixed flags ""overwhelming"" colour-wise, but I really like this one 😊😊
I don’t think I’ve ever heard of the golden infinity sign for autism before? I’ve only ever seen the rainbow one (to denote that autism is a spectrum)
Ah ok! Thank you!
Oh, it is perfect! Thank you so much <3
I’ll definitely let you know when I end up posting them!
😂
You are amazing! Thank you so much 💛🤍💜🖤
I'm not sure what exactly the history is, but I know that the rainbow one has been adopted to represent all neurodiversity. It's still very commonly used to represent autism, but I believe at some point a golden infinity sign was proposed to differentiate autistic pride (gold because ""Au""). I've got a golden infinity sign pin myself :)
Np!
You're welcome! 🥰
That’s really cool! Thanks!
Yeah, neurodivergence is a pretty wide spectrum in itself. Originally mostly the autism spectrum I believe, but I fall in it now with bipolar disorder technically the way it's used today. I think it's a bit different though - neurodivergence I think often implies it's not something to be treated or seen as needed to be ""cured"", more of a thing about focusing on inclusion, but bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders are something you almost always medicate and I wish there was a cure. Psychotic symptoms can be debilitating, and anti-psychotics themselves can be debilitating and have permanent side effects which thank god I didn't get.

Happy Pride Month y’all! I’m just shy of 3 months into my medical transition (with top surgery scheduled for September) and I really happy with the results so far! I’m also FINALLY completely out of the closet! Stay proud!		"1. You're cute as heck
2. I absolutely love that tattoo
wait do you not have nipples or am i missing something

You are quite handsome! Happy Pride :)
I love your hairstyle!
1. Thank you!
2. Thanks, I designed it myself!
You’re not, I squished them behind my arms as a sort of self censor
Thankies!
Thankies, I designed it myself!
According to my surgeon he said he’d be able to work around it! So fingers crossed!
That’s my kryptonite word, thank you!
Thanks I cut it myself, surprisingly
1. You're welcome
2. That's even cooler!
THAT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE NOW THANKS!
That's epic!

HAPPY EARLY PRIDE MONTH ENJOY MY DAISY CHAIN		"I love your hair so much 😍
Love it!
“Those are daisies. I find them cheerful“ (pls someone get the reference)
My gosh, you're stunning! The way you've styled your hair was what first caught my attention, but from the side angle of your face, I would genuinely and sincerely say that's the contours of your face are just so damn beautiful and aesthetically pleasing.

Good grief! Beauty.

I'm seriously, seriously loving the shaved sides, though. Gosh, they suit you so much, OP.
Uhm hello, ur majestic
That’s some cute stuff right there!
You are gorgeous!
oh my goodness your hair!! i love it!! 🥺
I adore your hair 🌻
Cute hair! Also tutorial please on how to make daisy chains?-
thank you!!!!
THANK U SO MUCH UR SO SWEET
You never made a daisy chain before? o.o 
Here it is: ♡♡♡
1. Pick some daisys
2. Make a hole with your fingernail at the flower stem of one
3. Put another flower steam through the hole of the first 
4. Make it as long as you want
5. Make a hole in the stem of the last daisy and put the head of the first daisy through it. 
(6.) Eat the white & yellow part of the daisy"	np9w3i	NonBinary	553	1.0	2021-05-31 18:24:50
Pride Flags at Chillout Daylesford, Victoria, Australia		"What's the one to the left of demisexual?
*genderfluid pride squee* 💖
Pretty bold of them to fly the flag of a nation that's declared war on your country
That amarok looks pretty good, ngl.
I don’t know? I took the photograph they’re not my flags
What nation?? None of these flags have anything to do with a country?
Oh I think it's the genderqueer flag. I took a closer look and it seems to be purple, not gray. (Also I was just asking in general to see if anyone who sees the post knows. It wasn't directed at you necessarily lol)
Looks very purple to me, so yeah"	tcax5s	NonBinary	557	1.0	2022-03-12 07:13:12
At the Women's March. My elder teen is NB. This sign will work for Pride parade as well.		"I really dislike the pussy hats but it's great to see NB representation in the March :)
good to see a supportive parent, and lovely handwriting!
Investing in long purpose protest signs is my new  favorite life goal ❤️
You're a good mom :) 
Wish I had a mom like you. Thank you for supporting them/ us  ❤️
Thank you cool mom!!!!
Yeah, it’s like nice sign, but why take away from a message of inclusivity with a hat that’s signalling “women have uteruses”. 
Also it always warms my heart to see parents support their children and help carry their voices <3 I wish mine were the same
Thanks, I love my kid and want them to be free to be them now and always, everywhere they go in life. 
I got a thick poster board that has foam on the middle. I liked the double sided signs I saw at the march. Thinking of what I can put on the back!!
Thanks! My kid came with me and had a great time. But it was freeg'n freezing!! We didn't stay for the political speeches, I felt it was important for my kid to hear the political leaders, but OMG it was cold!
My kids are my everything. If there were dyslexia and ADHD marches I would be out there with the other kid marching too. 
Exactly. Typical TERF vibes. I can see how many cis people haven't made that connection yet though.
You struck a note I was trying to get out there. I am a mother who is a cis woman marching in a Woman's March who specifically is calling for Non-binary rights. I have one mouth, but am sending several messages. I don't feel that the Pussy Hat is exclusive, lots of people of different genders were wearing them at this march. Did not post this to offend, but to show my support. 
Many trans people do feel that they're exclusive. Some of them are telling you directly about that. You do your thing, but you don't get to decide what's upsetting to trans people. Be well. "	ak2cby	NonBinary	539	0.99	2019-01-26 16:32:16

They/them, afab. Happy Pride!! 🌈🏳️‍🌈 Hanging out with my partner all day today! I’m so excited! How do I look? My hair is making me dysphoric but 🤷🏻		"Omg you’re so freaking handsome!! I hope y’all have the best day together.
I'm afab as well and I honestly hope to look as handsome as you do one day!
I think you look great. Don't see anything wrong with the hair. Also, love those glasses frames.
You look so good! Have a great day! ❤️
You look great!!
Curious, what do you want your hair to be more like?
Excuse me your hair is fucking amazing and your everything gives me gender envy
Happy Pride! 🌈🏳️‍🌈 You are incredibly cute!
Happy Pride!
You’re fine. you’re the definition of what I want to look like
happy pride! slay in all your non-binary glory! 💖
Every day i'm not as attractive as you is a day of PAIN
U have like the nicest arm hair ever I want some
BRUH. You look masc as fuck dude, you are gorgeous. I don’t think you need to worry about your hair!
Wow you’re super cute! Those glasses look great on you and I love your nose ring :) 💛🖤💜
Idk pretty andro, not much to say really
This probably sounds so weird but your glasses really suit you!!!! You look amazing!
Happy Pride! It’s uncanny how much you look like Dick Grayson.
You look amazing! Very handsome! (Or if that's not your preferred adjective, I could give you a different one!) And Happy Pride to you too!
I wish I had your cheekbones! You look great!
I love your glasses!!
Wow u look super cool!!! Tbh I can’t even tell that’s your afab !
Tbh if you didn’t say that you were afab I wouldn’t be able to tell.
Damn man looks like T has done great things for you!! Happy Pride 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
Sorry about that. To my non binary amab eyes I do not think feminine at all with the hair. It looks like pretty and actually taken care of male hair. Aka you like your hair and you take care of it. That kinda what I get from the glance
Thank you so much! That’s so sweet, oh we definitely will!
Aww thank you!! You’re so sweet! I’ve been on T since 2016 and had keyhole top surgery in 2019. You look amazing too, you beautiful human! It’s pride month! celebrate yourself, where you are, where you’ve been and will be. All of us look amazing and beautiful in our own way!
Exactly
Thank you so much! I really appreciate your comment
Thank you! I hope you have a wonderful day!
Thank you so much!
Thanks for the question. I want my hair to be more of a longer-ish mullet in the back, with choppy texturized bangs and completely shaved on the sides
Happy pride! Thank you!
Thanks, Happy pride to you too!
Thank you so much. Happy pride to you as well! I do feel so proud to be non binary
😳 I am speechless but thank you and you just made my day. These comments are making me feel so good about myself today when I really needed it. Thank you. You all are beautiful humans don’t let anyone tell you different!
Haha thank you! Yes you can have majority of it cause I honestly never really liked my arm hair. Love this comment! Haha
Awww 🥺😭🥰 thank youuuu! You really brightened up my day! Really boosting my confidence! Thanks!
Thank you soo much you’re sweet! Happy pride!
Thanks!
Thank you so much I don’t think it is weird at all! I get a lot of compliments on them. I actually got them at target optical. Thank you again!
Thank you happy pride to you too! I didn’t know who the superhero actor was so I had to google the name haha. But I agree with you it’s so funny and neat.
Thank you so much. I actually still vibe with “handsome” because to me it can be genderless
Thank you so much! Funny thing is I never used to has them and T really changed my face and made cheekbones stand out more and jawline
Thank you! They are Ray-Bans
Thank you yes I know I hear that all the time I pass very well as a cis male and did every more so when I had a full beard haha.
Thank you! It sure has, partner says I look really different then pre T
Happy pride to you too! 🏳️‍⚧️
Aw thank you so much!! I'm currently pre everything so you're deffo transition goals for me atm 🥺
Well I know you can get there, I’m sorry it’ll take time to get there tho
never let anyone tell you otherwise!! trust me, sometimes it can REALLY get to you 😅
You look like an AI rendered the definition of ""beautiful""

I hate u

I will become more beautifuler and destroy you, there can only be one

jokes aside, love yourself
You’re also just very attractive in general! I love your septum piercing
You’re welcome! I really understand but you’ll get there I promise! You just have to be positive. Thank you ☺️
Thank you I really appreciate it so much. Yes you’re right it’ll take time til I can get it. I just love at home still so once I move out in January, I’ll be able to do so. Thanks again
Oh I know you are so right my family is that way and my mother continues to misgender me  and doesn’t accept me being nb but my nb amab partner just keeps using my right pronouns and I just love it 😍
Hahaha best comment ever. I laughed its onnn! We’ll just see, I’ll fight you and I’ll win! Haha thank you and you love yourself too
Thank you so much! I love the septum as well I’ve had it for I want to say 4 months now. I want to get real Gauges eventually and stretch the septum a little bit
Honestly made my day, thank you! You're so very kind
Of course, fam. Happy pride ♥️❤️‍🔥
Happy for you!!! Future's looking bright 💖

Some pride flag hot air balloons I crocheted for the last festival of the year!		"They're so cute!! So awesome!!
Wait you're not the person on Etsy who crotchets non-binary heart keychains and bi-ceratops keychains are you?
How lovely!
I really want one so bad
Awesome! What yarn did you use?
These are so cute.
They are so beautiful.
so cool!
These are so cute, do you have a pattern for them?
all my flags! ☺️☺️ they’re so cute
Thank you!
No, sorry, I don't have an Etsy account.
Thanks!
Thank you! You can DM me if you want.
Thanks! It's all just yarn from Walmart and Michael's that I've amassed over the years.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thanks!
They're my own pattern that I made like 10 years ago. I can DM you with it when Igey a chance to type it up if you want.

Super proud of this post I made on Facebook for Pride Month! 🥰		"Very nice write up, and kudos to you for being able to display who you truly are! Keep up the good work!  Hopefully others will follow your example.
As a fellow genderfluid trans enby who likes multiple genders and grew up in the faith, I felt almost every word of this. It can be a really deep hole to crawl out of, I'm so glad you can be yourself now 💖
Lovely picture (and outfit, damn) and lovely post. I really hope this gets received well friend!!! I’m excited for you -
Well done 😊
GENDERFLUID GANG!! You look awesome 👌 great job
loved reading your journey and i’m also wondering if you go to SCAD? or just visited savannah? i’m going in fall 😮
Very eloquent. I'm glad you could put yours words out there 😊
What a story! I have all of the emotions and feel so seen so thank you for sharing!!
That's awesome, I love it. Your text is really nice written and I like it. I myself am a gender questioning person so that really inspires me, thx :)
I'm pan, trans, non binary, genderfluid
Thank you for sharing that. I am trying to figure out what I am and your post and story has helped.
I'm a rising senior in animation there! And thanks!!
no way! 2D or 3D? I’m going into 2D animation as a freshman
I'm in the story and concept development concentration! Basically visual development, character design, storyboarding, etc. But I've been doing a lot more 2D animation lately!
woahh sounds like exactly what i want to be doing! so fun! good luck this year 🫶🏼

Been working on my fitness since coming out. Sharing some pride while I do it		"dude that’s awesome! (also, I desperately need to know where the theirwolf shirt is from *desperately*)
You're absolutely crushing it here! 💪
I love those shirts 🥺 where'd you get them? Also good for you keep crushing it!
You go! I love your shirt to haha
How awesome!!!

Though you should check out their entire pride selection (they've got cool nerdy shit too) cause they have tons of cool designs. Also you can get pretty much any of their designs on any of their products, so if you like the Theirwolf you could get different styles of t shirt or a sweatshirt, or a mug, mask, etc with it. 

My absolute favorite place to gift shop for my friends. I don't work for the site I just adore their shit
Thank you 😄

I commissioned an NB flag themed hanging from my cousin and she did an amazing job! I've always wanted a pride flag but didn't want to buy a basic one, so this is perfect.		"This is truly amazing! I wish I could have or make such great art 😊

Props to your cousin
That is amazing! Totes jelly, I wish I could have one. Your cousin is very talented and that is gorgeous.
Does your cousin have an Etsy shop?
That is quite dope!  I think it would be nice if more people crafted their own 'flags'.  I think I will try my hand at something creative.  Thanks for the inspiration!
That's amazing! I love it!
Here's her Page!

It’s an EnvyGreen Manor spring collection shirt! All the shirts have very cottage-core printing
Thank you! It has mushrooms, plants, moths and other various occultish themed things! As someone said before its from EnvyGreen manor. The rainbows were made through a film I have over my bathroom window that turns sunlight into rainbows, you can find it on amazon but also sometimes in stores too.
Just looked through their Insta and wow. Definitely a brand to keep an eye on. Thanks!

Happy Pride! I drew this to celebrate my two-spirit Native family out there. Wado tsunalii!		"Hell yeah, this is awesome!!! There's like no native rep on reddit so thank you op
Love the art! Could you tell us more about which two-spirit tradition you're portraying here? I'd love to know more
What does wado tsunalii mean? /gq
 Wow, this art is gorgeous! Happy Pride to you too c:
Very rare to see art which celebrates someone like me. I am two-spirit from the Seminole tribe, Unconquered Pride right here. Thank you and many blessings. May your art continue to bring joy.
Agreed! Native voices are so important, but so rarely heard. On reddit...and in general really. I'm trying to make an effort to change that and just...speak about it more. Be loud and proud, right? 

(In my real life I hear Native voices all the time, though. Namely my mothers. And lemme tell you, that Native voice carries...lololol. lol. Jk. Love you mom...heh).
Agreed. Maybe they're a numerical minority but that makes them even more important, doesn't it? The more perspectives we have the more likely we are to solve any given problem.
I didn't portray a specific *tradition* in particular, just some Eastern Cherokee imagery (the smokey mountains, the flag colors in the beads, the roach headdress) with some rainbow thrown in. Cause...I'm a big 'ol gay.  

If you mean two-spirit in general, it was a term adopted in 1990 at the yearly Gay and Lesbian Native gathering, to encompass all the ""outside the gender binary"" peoples in Native tribes. Most tribes have terminology for ""two spirit"" people, this is just an umbrella term. There's tons of information out there, here's a [good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4lBibGzUnE) that gives a basic summary of it! A lot of tribes had two spirit members all throughout our history, and accepted or even celebrated them for the special people they were! It wasn't perfect, but it was a far cry from...ya know, Puritans and shit.
It just means thanks friends :)
Thank you, oginalli! Native representation, and therein two-spirit rep, are *always* lacking. We may be few, but we sure as hell are proud! Happy pride to you :)
Yeah, thanks for the response! I knew two-spirit was an umbrella term but I didn't know how to articulate asking for more info. Thrilled to see Cherokee rep in this sub and I'll def check out the video!
Thanks!
Haha, word. I can rarely articulate anything, so I feel you. And yay! Tsalagi life!"	nqozbj	NonBinary	495	1.0	2021-06-02 15:51:57
I hope it’s okay to share these, I’ve been working on pride dice and had a request for non-binary! Wanted to share, they look so cool!		"As a nb DM I really love these! Where are you selling these and how much are they? Will you ink them, too?
Those look great
Beautiful! I’ve been looking to make something similar myself (I make resin dice, but I’m still perfecting the whole layering colors thing). I love these!
Wow
Eeeee! I love them
I love this, but I can't see the numbers
enby dice!!!!
TAKE ALL MY MONEY (even tho i have none 🥲)
These are awesome! Where did you find dice resin molds?
Feel free to message me for details! I do ink them, I just get excited to share when I pull them straight from the mold lol
Thank you!
Thank you! I cure each color individually, it is the cleanest way to get those lines. I’ve been letting them fully cure but I bet you could halve the cure time and still be good
I hope you like them!
I’m so glad to hear it!
They’re fresh out of the mold, I hadn’t inked them yet cuz I was too excited to share
I hoped they would make someone happy!
What a mood! But if you ever are interested in dice, feel free to message me for details!
I made the molds myself! I bought 3D printed masters and made my own molds
I’ll try this! Thanks!
Coolio
What colour are you inking them in? Looks hard to find something that'll be visible on all  the sides.
Ah i see! Very cool!
I’ve done silver on the other pride dice with white ice made and it looks really good! I might do the same here"	qewxb2	NonBinary	484	1.0	2021-10-24 17:36:23
Outfit today ended up being low key NB flag colors. Happy pride everyone 💛⚪️💜🖤		"Where did you get a Hex Girls shirt?!?! My gay awakening
your hair is fucking GORGEOUS

Ok love that shirt where did you get it
I love the hex girls shirt queenie! Sorry if the word I used is offencive, I just use that to adress people who look amazin'
Lmao same 😂 I got it at hot topic
Thank u :’)
Thanks 😊
My hair is so dark it was a very long process to lighten it enough (low key killed my ends too). Even then we had to go darker on the roots. Ive been there though I’ve had purple fails before it’s rough for brunettes.
Thank you ☺️
Hot topic :)
Thank u 😊
I love that word!! And thanks :))
I finally got a real stylist so I might try again with professional help
Well looks great on you
Any time awesome
You should! Be warned mine ended up being pretty expensive because of how long it took to lighten. Good luck if you do!
Thanks! I’ve decided to be more open with spending money on my appearance especially if it will help with dysphoria. Can’t put a price on happy
That’s awesome! Do what’s gonna make you most comfortable and happy in your own skin. It’s always worth it. I’m working on that’s myself. 💜💜"	nrlqgb	NonBinary	486	1.0	2021-06-03 19:28:23
Yesterday someone posted pride flags in r/Minecraft and got lots of negativity, so I made this and tagged them to show support for their idea…and it was removed immediately so maybe you’ll appreciate it more…		"Having haters just means you're *\*winning\**
And FYI…I was operating under a limit of 30 seconds for video (Nintendo switch limitations)…so since it was for the Minecraft sub I was trying to be as inclusive as possible in general with the timeframe…

So I apologize if anyone here sees missing flags they would have preferred.
So cool, I love it
As far as I can tell it was deleted because they have a rule against posts referencing other posts
Seems silly but atleast not actively homophobic
Im not regular over there but I like to give people benefit of the doubt
Wow :0!! These look amazing ^_^
Sorry but what’s trisexual? I know the rest of these I just never heard of it.
Lol, that’s very true.
Thank you!
Yes not ACTIVELY homophobic.  The rule states no new posts in reference to others to stop one person spamming 12 posts of one thing.  My removal message said “update your previous post directly, and do not submit “fixed posts/changes” with a few days.  Do not make unrelated posts within 12 hours of each other”…

If someone can make. “Worlds longest staircase” and a competition of dozens of posts pop up in less than a day one upping it (and sometimes referenced to the original) then I don’t think it’s fair that mine is banned just because of the reference…in reality the same stuff is copied a lot…that’s how Minecraft and creative builds work…

Although to be clear I suspect the mods really just don’t want to have to deal with a bunch of phobic assholes again so soon…and it was probably reported right away….so I AM NOT saying it was discriminatory against me…just very frustrating…
its attraction to any three genders :)"	plsxpp	NonBinary	472	0.99	2021-09-10 20:25:17
I’m really missing pride month but I did just start gender therapy and I’ve never been happier in my transition.		"CONGRATULATIONS!!!! OH MY GOSH THATS SO EXCITING!!!!
Talking to someone is very helpful. It really helped me become open and honest about who I am and who I want to be. I hope it does the same for you
Nice Geoff popsicle tattoo!
Hey, would you mind talking a little about your experience just starting gender therapy? I'm nervous to as i've never done therapy before so it'd help to hear someone elses experience and if there's anything I should know beforehand :)
ok..howd u get ur hair that color.. what color did u start with. that color is my dreaaammm
You look really content and I dig it
The good news is pride month can be pride year if you want it to be. Happy pride 2019 ;)
It’s seriously so much better than I could have imagined and I’m feeling so hopeful. It feels good
I’m hoping it helps me feel comfortable in the decisions I make as I transition and I’m really hopeful for it
Thanks! I hope I get to show him in person one day
I’ve only had my intake session but it was still a great experience, and I’m not new to therapy. What was surprising to me was it was one of the most validating experiences of my life and the most intense euphoria I have ever felt. 

In therapy you set goals, that’s still true for gender therapy. My goals in GT are to decide if I want to come out to my family and to decide if I want to medically transition, and be happy with my decisions. 

My biggest advice is to find a lgbt therapist. There are therapists who might cover lgbt issues but you will be better off with someone who specialises in it, so they know what they are talking about and you’re not explaining anything to them. 

I love my therapist, he’s a lot like me, young, and happy to talk to me. He’s been accepting and asks a lot of clarifying questions that make me think but doesn’t mind when I don’t have an answer. He likes my goals and we are ready to work on them.
I’ve been dying my hair for ages. I’m naturally a strawberry blonde. This is most currently manic panic blue steel over ion titanium. Gray isn’t easy to maintain, I think I’ve had the best results with arctic foxes gray though. You really need to be as bleached as possible for good results. I also use purple shampoo
I had to explain to my partner what a “candid” was hah
Yay!! I'm so glad!!
I hope for that as well babe. If you ever need a peer to talk to as you go through stuff just hit me up.
Thanks for the reply! I really appreciate it. I'm in the UK so I'll probably see if I can go via a gender identity clinic (there's one like 20 minute drive from me) and get a therapist or something via that, then it should make it easier if I decide to medically transition/when I do.

If you can't tell I really overthink these things :P"	c82yge	NonBinary	474	1.0	2019-07-02 01:23:26
What do you think of my Pride outfit / make-up?		"I love it!!! You really rock that look!
Absolutely rocking it, defo going to steal your look lmao
You look awesome! I love the whole thing you got going there!
Super cute, that eye makeup really suits you and the dress fits so well! Plus you look really happy, and that makes the look come together perfectly. Nothing better than seeing a person happy in their own skin!
Looks great but I was distracted by the fact that the first picture looks like a band photo, thought you were dancing to the other guys’ singing or something.

Your eyeliner is fantastic, seriously.
It looks amazing, love it (both)
Gorgeous. Where is that skirt from? I literally can't function normally without it in my life now that I've seen it.
Loving that outfit, sibling.
Holy hell I love that necklace/collar so fucking much
That is the biggest choker I've ever seen.
When I see eyeliner that amazing I always say it's so perfect and sharp it could cut a bitch. Haha. You look incredible!
SO COOL OMG
Looking great!!!
Excellent, also those wings are 🔥
I can't decide if the smile or the makeup/outfit is better they're both so great
Love it!
Love everything about this outfit! ❤️
Aw thanks !! 🤗
Tyvm !! It's great if it inspires you ! 😁
Thank youuuuu ❤
Thanks a lot !! 🤗 That was the first time I went to a Pride being out as non binary and it felt truly liberating and empowering to look like what I want ! People were really nice, someone even helped me with the makeup (I wouldn't have done it so good if I tried by myself 😅). I wish you and all people here to be as confident as I felt this day ! 😊
Haha no these guys are actual cops ! I just thought it was fun to have a picture in front of cops for no reason 😅  
And thanks for the liner !! Someone did it for me, I wanted to have a perfect make up for the Pride but I'm not very good at doing it myself 😄 gotta keep practicing though !
Thank you so much 🤗
Me just now realizing it's a dress but it having no effect on my opinion.
Thank you ! ❤️😊
Thanks ! I got a lot of compliments on it too 😊 I got it from this Etsy shop : https://www.etsy.com/fr/shop/Animalhairstuff

Fun at Pride		"I can't help noticing it's all threats, not even begging you to seek salvation. Just threats.
Imagine wasting your time hating instead of loving. How divine is that?
Dunk on the brainwashed
Gotta love the old white dudes in neon yellow and cargo pants
Vaccinated in the blood of Jesus Christ???  Oh man, just when you think you’ve seen it all…
""I'm fully vaccinated in the blood of Jesus christ"" says that sign, doesn't that just mean he's pissed as a pudding on wine?
Don't they realize all these signs make god sound super unappealing lmao
Look at those degenerates...
They can't even order their rainbow right
The jesus one💀💀💀
The dudes shirt literally says fear god. Wtf is wrong with these people
how much you wanna bet that woman with the gossipers sign gossiped afterwards with her ladies, but it was okay cause she was at Bible studies?
Legendary image
The best way to deal with these kinds of people is to not take them seriously. They want you to be angry, they want a reaction. So, just be silly
Troll the trolls. I like it.
the signs 💀 if theyre “christians” theyre supposed to be patient and not force their religeon on others 😭😭 all of them are threatsss
anyone else see ""baby idolators"" in the sign on the left and think that was the best self-own, before you realized?
There was a protest like this in my brothers town. It was ended in spectacular fashion by a bunch of sexed up drag queens who showed up, set up camp next to them, and proceeded to hand out free lube packets and flirt with everyone, *particularly* the homophobes.

The whole protest vanished in 15 minutes 😂
Hope your being safe
As someone currently breaking free from Christian ideology the threats are the only thing keeping most people in the church cause “if you leave you’ve got an eternity of pain waiting for you “
And like, some anti-vax sentiment? WTF? 1) what does that have to do with Pride??? and 2) Like, where in the Bible does it say anything about no medicine? (Rather, the opposite. It even teaches some medicine in places.) (Obviously it wouldn't talk about vaccines because they weren't invented yet... much like modern homosexuality, hint hint to those folks. ;) )

I mean, my mom's fully vaccinated in the blood of Jesus Christ, but she's also vaccinated against COVID, the flu, polio, and a whole mess of others. Pretty much every Christian I know is. ;)
Imagine being at doctors office and they inject blood into your arm. ""OK, so this will protect you from sinful urges and satanic viruses, have a nice day!""
WAIT I DIDNT NOTICE IT WAS A THREAT-
guyspls
That definition of fear means to honour. To fear God means to honour him. But it definitely is not a good description, and sounds super culty
I'm lucky I didn't realize this was a thing until after I left the church. When I told my pastor I was leaving the faith he was just sad. ""I'm sorry, my child. I hope one day you rejoin us, but I wish you well all the same.""
The church has gotten good at that over the last couple millennia. All the churches have. It makes me sad to think how well it still works, despite relatively easy access to information from all over the word.
I've be never been religious so I don't know 'the book' that well. I still feel like self-improvement and knowledge was something Jesus was seen advocating for consistently, if you strip away the apostles' differing personal agendas.

Religion only became a tool for control when Jesus' (alleged) words were being censored by whichever church centuries after Jesus' (alleged) lifetime.
Bloody Greeks inventing homosexuality 😔
I think its just the fear of something new that makes them be against it. Its the same reason why most of them are against LGBTQ+. Its something new that wasn't around when they were growing up, so they're against it because ""Back in my day, it was either boy or girl, not 'Non-Binary' or 'Gay' or any of those silly things you kids say you are these days.""
That’s confusing. It just sounds like intimidation and manipulation. Definitely sounds culty.
Definitely not the response I got but im happy for you in that regard
You see, the border between religion and cult is very thin.
There is no border that’s the catch
The difference between a religion and a cult is that in a cult, there's a man (and it's always a man) at the top who knows the whole thing's a sham.

In a religion, that man is dead.
Exactly. Religion is a euphonism for cult."	xn3dip	NonBinary	458	1.0	2022-09-24 20:37:37
I made this piece to represent Trans Pride and Solidarity		"From left to right- 

First Row: 

Transfem, Nonbinary, Agender

Second Row: 

Genderfluid, Transmasc
Cute! Love what you did.
tag urself im genderfluid
This is so cool! What creature is nonbinary?
New pride flag just dropped
I love all these, may i ask, what animals are the agender one
i fuckin love this dude!!
Oh these are all DARLING BEASTIES. Super cute designs!!
this RULES thank you for creating it ☺️
Beautiful!!!!
is genderfluid a marine critter because marine critter live in 'fluid'?
I want to be the transmasc dog
Thank you!
The second one/one in the middle on the top row
Butterfly, rabbit, and dragon

The dragon is to reference my design to asexual and aromantic, this ties all the “A” identities together as dragons
Haha yes, but it is also part peacock
He is a bat butterfly hybrid! He does have the general shape of a dog though lol. Both trans pride variants are the same creatures but I thought transfem/transmasc deserved their respective versions since I did a separate creature for the others.
Oh no, I meant what type of creature, but thanks!
lord i'm so immature that I can't see the word peacock without giggling to myself
Oh! It is a sloth, bee/butterfly, and pangolin mixed together. The bee/butterfly is to tie this flag in with the theme of butterflies for most of these. I didn’t add wings to the design for genderfluid because it would have been too busy.
>!(shh don’t tell anyone that I was tempted to type “peecock”)!<
>!Say peacock and no one bats an eye, say pooppussy and everyone looses their mind

My mom got me an outfit for pride!		"It looks like the reusable grocery bag material lol
This is adorable.
Ooooh, cool glasses! (and rainbows)
Stealth!
I have the same trans pendant.  Interesting glasses.  Does having different lens shapes mess with vision at all?
Sick fashion sense!
Too subtle, better add a wacky hat /s

I kid, that's fucking dope, I love these kinds of outfits. I wish I didn't have a foot in the closet, I'd love to go to Pride. Well that and also I wish my local Pride wasn't so aggressively rainbow-capitalist. But I *love* how dressed up people get for Pride.
Nice!
cool glasses!
Hell yes
YES! You look great wish you luck at pride! 🏳️‍🌈
I fucking love that outfit. Say hi to your mom for me
You look awesome!
It does. XD
Thanks
During the first 5 minutes I had them, yes.
Yeah, and tomorrow I'm going to a party with my girlfriend, and I'm going to tye-dye the Non-Binary flag on to a shirt.
I never realized until this moment how much I wanted a non-binary tye-dye shirt.

You're an inspiration!
And I might try to do a Trans flag tye dye shirt
Thank You. You have no idea how much that means to me. I'm the youngest out of three and going in to 9th grade, with no one by my side. THANK YOU"	buh5oo	NonBinary	451	0.99	2019-05-29 16:56:39
I can't have a pride flag IRL so I made my Animal Crossing Island Flag one instead!		"I love
I did the exact same thing in my town
*UwU*
I love it ❤
That's awesome! I did something similar with my phone case once I unlocked the custom kits!
I'm so gonna do this, I just started animal crossing 🥰🥰 I did an enby flag hoodie tho
I did the same thing in my town but with the gay flag in the background and genderqueer flag in the heart!
Why cant you have one irl?
The virus has canceled most of the early ones. The one in my state was moved to November, but I know lots of others just ended up canceling them.
I sadly live with my parents, who do not accept me for who I am."	g1axpy	NonBinary	453	1.0	2020-04-14 18:27:00

That's awesome! I love it!

Amazing! Do you have an IG for your art?
Hehe! I love this!
Nice! It looks like an LSU poster as well.
I love it, so cool! :)
I need this in my bedroom
Thank you so much!
I do! It's @cariboou
LOL, As an enby from Louisiana I immediately wondered how LSU art made it into my home feed.
Followed! Your art is fantastic!

I crocheted myself a top for Pride. What do you all think?		"love it!! so talented!!
VERY GOOD YES.
Do you take commissions?
remarkable! how long have you been crocheting for???
That is gorgeous and the only issue is is it breezy enough? There's been heatwaves where I live but I don't know where u are. Still it's gorgeous and I would wear it with pride to pride haha! ❤️
Awesome!
Looks great!!!
Freaking awesome!
Oh shit I thought I was in r/crochet!! It looks fab :D
How did you make this? I would love to do something like it myself
This is fucking talent
This is so cute!! Do you have a pattern you'd be willing to share?
Very nice!
It looks incredible! How long did it take you to make?
ITS SO HECKIN CUTE OMFG YES I WANT ONE I LOVE THE DRAPING I LOVE THE PATTER FUCK ITS PERFECT YES YASSS yaaaASSSSSSSSSS!!!!!
Yaaaaas!!!! 😻😻😻
Gorgeous, majestic, ethereal
Why is this so perfect?
I love it but I would have to wear it over a T-shirt.  I need sleeves for my arms.  Just enough to cover the armpit area.
I’m wondering if you do commissions 😭
I think your wrists must be aching! Awesome work though! I hope it breaths well because (depending on the place of course) Pride can get pretty hot.
i love it so much! just be careful not to let the breeze catch you or let it hang too low in the neck area
Lol do you offer lessons
I want one...
Thank you! It was my first time making this pattern
1.5 I think lol

A lovely gift from my bf this pride month! He works at Home Depot, saw these, and got one for me. Then, he forgot about it and got me another one.		"Home depot does have NB energy, it's only appropriate
I'm glad and it's very nice of your boyfriend to think of you, I'm glad you have a supportive partner!

Just as a heads up to anyone wondering if this means Home Depot is a welcoming workplace for trans people, I've heard it's definitely not in general. My ex-partner's awful experiences, as a trans fem working at Home Depot, were mainly with customers, but the company doesn't necessarily do anything to prevent it or make that problem better. I heard the same thing from a trans fem friend who worked there too. I live in a very ""blue"" area so I imagine the customer issue would be worse in other places. I would take them having Home Depot branded pronoun buttons as an example of rainbow capitalism, not as a sign they are a safe welcoming place for trans employees.
Need me a Home Depot bf
They/them can refer to you in every context of the pronoun :D
Yeah honestly it does
We are Canadian, actually, and he works the overnight crew so he literally never engages with customers. Only the two other cishet (I'm assuming) white guys who are crazy enough to work overnights. 

Canada is a little better about trans issues than the us. We aren't amazing but at least I've never faced any discrimination for being openly genderqueer in my workplaces and my boyfriends boss thought that a text message from me was actually a Grindr notification because he just assumed that my bf was gay based on how he talked about me.
My uncle is the general manager of a Lowe's. Their rivalry is unmatched but they are also extremely similar (love dnd, are the oldest brother, would kill anyone who hurt me, both a cat and a dog person.)"	vaveck	NonBinary	433	0.99	2022-06-12 21:01:59

GOD YOU ARE SO FUCKING CUTE
Looks great.  For those who lack confidence to wear a skirt publicly... only way to gain it is by doing it.  Trust me.  I have been there.  First time it was like the whole planet froze to look at me and stare.  But now, I don't even think a second thought other than do I want to or not.
super beautiful!!

I am too! Solidarity
That outfit is killer!
You look spectacular. This is a self-confidence hump I need to get over one day.

Awesome accessorizing with the choker.
You look SO GOOD! I'm actually a little jealous. :P
Yes! Look amazing with the skirt.

LOVE IT
Killing it. I love the cut of the skirt and must steal it.
I'm not out publicly yet either, i totally understand why you're nervous! If you feel up for it you totally should c: thank you!
Thank you! Tights feel amazing :o

Think it'll depend on how confident I am on the day and if I'm with friends. Really want to wear it but I'm a bit scared about negative reactions.

My first pride accessory (homemade to explain the quality). Parents are transphobic so I can't get myself anything without being super discreet. The string has non-binary colours and the beads trans and rainbow pride		"Thats so cute and the quality doesnt look bad at all!!!
This is awesome I think it’s super cute- hopefully you will be in a safer environment to come out fully one day.
Hey, u/zzzonal I hope this counts :)
Very nice! Great way to be creative. Sorry you’re dealing with that situation, but you’re awesome and valid and keeping your pride alive!
YES MONARCH! Slipping in that validation on the down low <3
I love that!
That looks really good!!
This is a good idea! I might make something like this, but as a necklace.
Super cute idea! And who cares about quality... its important to you thats all you need <3 just be aware wool stretches and thins over time :) especially if it gets wet.
The home made stuff is the best stuff. I absolutely love it.
Ah! Thank you so much! It's simple but I can't stop looking at it
Thank you mate! I hope so too. It's not the most pleasant but the little things keep me going
YES, it absolutely does!  Rock on.  🤘  You are officially entry #7 in the Enby Sweater Contest.  (Apologies for the delay, had to take some time away to slowly process current events for a bit.  ❤️)  Good luck!
Yeah no I never really experienced crap for being gay but when I came out as trans (non binary) I got some but I’m still in a safe environment so I got my first pride flags. The feeling is magic and I really hope that it isn’t long before you can have that experience ❤️
That sounds so nice (that certain feeling, not the crap you got)

It's the end of disability pride month, so shout out to all my other disabled/chronically ill trans/n-b sibs! Next is disability wrath month, & me and my cane are ready!!		"[image description: a demiboy who has the sides of their head shaved & the top floof of hair dyed blue-green is holding their cane by the shaft and sitting on a very dark blue couch. They are wearing a dark blue button down patterned with small, medium-blue bowties and a pair of cream-colored slacks. Their cane's shaft is made of ebony wood, and the handle is stainless steel. End description.]

Is it okay to say that your cane makes you look extra dapper and I love it? Because it does and I do
I love that shirt so much
I'm double loaded with crutches for wrath month... I'll need a chair to use both in attack formation tho haha
Sometimes I miss my cane. Shattered leg, big surgery, titanium rod. It was fun to threaten bullies with it. Also homophobes and transphobes.
Man you are rocking that shirt, the colour really suits you!
I hope it was a good month😁
I love your cane! My dog ate mine so I need a new one, where did you get it?!
I will take out the knee caps of ableist and queerphobic people, but my cane is collapsible so it may take a few tries
If you’d like to join us, r/DisabledPride is now open!
Oh totally!!! I love my cane so much, you can't see the wood very well here but it's a super pretty & dark ebony wood and it's gorgeous.very heavy, very sturdy, very very pretty.
My cane is like a limb at this point. A very snazzy limb.

Me at Trans Pride Day in Stuttgart, Germany		"Hey I was there too:))
Ich liebe es! You are awesome! :)
Love it
This just reminds me of resistance by excision and I’m just here for it
Love it!! 💖
Nice. 🏳️‍🌈🥰
Sehr geil! Ich geh davon aus, dass die Maske absichtlich auf'm Kopf steht? :D
Shit, you are holding my future tattoo there!

Now I am feeling really bad I didn't go (also located in Stuttgart) but I had a cough and wasn't feeling to well, so I did the responsible thing and stayed home instead of either endangering people or make them vastly uncomfortable...
Thought it said respect distance 😂 looking good comrade
Very cool, but I must ask
Why the sign is in english?
Well, I'd say it means potentially reaching more people - and any German translation of that sounds a bit clunky xD"	pp0bxt	NonBinary	379	1.0	2021-09-15 22:16:53

The Euphoria of a Shaved Head ☺️ Happy Pride Month!!		"Oh man, this makes me want to shave my head again!!! Must... resist.... urges...
Wish I could rock that kind of look. Since I started on testosterone I swear my hair gets thinner and frailer with every damn week... Still 100% worth it, but I'll admit I'm a little sad. I just don't have a good head shape for bald/shaved hair.
Great look! Love the custom necklace but doesn’t it itch?
I love your wings!
I own one bottle of shampoo and consider it a lifetime supply. :)

Reping our flag on a shirt I just finished for a market today! Happy pride everyone 🖤💜🤍💛		"Looks great! Can I ask what type of fabric this is?
It's actually knitted! I made it on my knitting machine 😊

Lol apparently “looks great” is my go-to this evening 😂🤦🏼
I was trying to find any seams from color blocking and didn’t so figured it was knitted. That’s impressive 😊

I went to Pride yesterday after coming out a week ago!!		"! Cute! I remember your last post, how did coming out go?
Ahhhh I love your outfit and hair!
I absolutely love the overalls look.
Really love your outfit especially the shoes and the backpack, but is there a reason for the whistle?
Ahhh tysm!!!! I made a really long, honest post about it on FB and it was very well received!!! Part of me thinks that some people only liked it to seem “inclusive” and that people actually have different opinions in person, but I’m trying to put faith in humanity that people aren’t really like that. 😊
AHHHH TYSM!!! <3
Thank you!!! I got them from H&M in the sale for £7. I'd been looking for a pair for ages but they were either always too big or too expensive!
Thank you! I got it at the pride parade!! 🏳️‍🌈🌈
Whistles help alert others that someone is in danger. They can also startle attackers and give the wearer/user a chance at escaping.
!! I'm stoked for you and that approach is totally valid! I hope you're getting all the support you deserve and then some!
That's how I feel about buying some now, just waiting for sales.
It's sad that people are feeling the need to use that. Thanks for the explanation.

just here to remind u that ur still hella gay and valid if ur nb but didn’t go to pride because u couldn’t or because crowds make u nervous or u would prefer to just chill w a couple of ur gay friends on gay day 🖤✨		"thank you!!! as a baby nb who isn’t out to anyone other than my queer partner, going to pride felt so overwhelming but I’m feeling super guilty today. really appreciate the reminder 💕
You look great!!!
I want to go but don't have anyone to go with.
thank you 💖 i really wanted to go to the parade here and i had the day off, but i had a bunch of small but important stuff to do (like laundry and meal prepping), and i felt like i was somehow being gay wrong because i prioritized setting my week up for success over a once-a-year event.
Thank you
Yeah, pride is cool and all, but every time I've gone I've had a panic attack.
major cutie alert!
Thank you this is kinda making me tear up after a really rough few days thank you you look amazing btw ;-;
Thanks
You look Hella cute 😊
There's no pride events where I live. And there's barely any support for trans people here- even the binary people. There's zero acknowledgement of nbs outside of lgbt+ spaces.
Hey cutie
Hey, if you don't like crowds you don't like crowds. There is no reasonable moral code which states you must like being in a crowd of people similar to you just because they are similar to you.
hey urself :))) 🖤🖤🖤
Yeah, my comment paints it as worse than it is for me though.

All the times I've gone, I've went with close friends. I've brought earplugs. We've managed to stick together the whole time, and they're pretty decent at reading my fidgets and seeing when I'm feeling really stressed out so that we move to a more quiet area.

And I've had fun each time I've went. That's why I keep going.

Nonbinary Flag Pride Soaps (Cold Process)		"Oooh these are gorgeous!
What does it smell like :o
I thought these were popsicles. I'm guessing I shouldn't eat them lol. They look super cool though!!
Sweet!
This is awesome! Do you know if it has any animal products in it?
Thanks! I'm super happy how they turned out.
The fragrance is called ""Smell the Rainbow"".  The company describes it as a holiday citrus scent, but everyone I've had smell it agrees it smells exactly like Skittles. \^\_\^
I swear there must be a conspiracy... all of my friends call various soaps I've made food and want to eat them. And I thought this one FOR SURE would escape that. But no. 😂

It definitely would not taste good tho haha.
❤
Yes, there is. I formulated my own recipe, so I know exactly what goes into it and I use lard as part of my recipe. I am not vegan/vegetarian and it brings important qualities to the soap for my skin.

FWIW, the closest non-animal substitute in terms of properties (palm oil) is almost entirely unethically sourced and/or causing environmental harm to produce the sustainable version neither of which I can support. It's better IMO to use a product that is available in excess and otherwise goes to waste.
I love it 🥺🥺🥺💕
I strongly disagree on animal exploitation being a better option for the environment, but you do you. I will continue to refrain from objectifying and abusing sentient life. 😊
Me too!  It's my favorite to use when I make pride-themed soaps. :)
For what it’s worth, I agree with you."	raco36	NonBinary	322	1.0	2021-12-06 17:30:05
Made this skirt for pride. Guess it'll be pride every day from now on.		"That is a bloody badass skirt

Love it!
this is so cool!!
Ooooh! That’s a good one! Looks great on you.
Love the asymmetrical cut of the colors, it really makes them pop!! What pattern did you use?
Are those many Anarchist flags?
I LOVE this!! Do you have a pattern or did you design it yourself?
ANCOM SKIRT 

VERY MUCH APPROVED
That's awesome. 🙂
Thank you.

It's basically a half circle skirt, but not made from equal circle segments, but alternating 6 black rectangles and 6 colored triangles like [this](https://imgur.com/a/UrRvJSh) (not to scale). The top is simply a very wide hem with elastic, because I'm pretty new to sewing and zippers are kinda confusing.
Technically yes, but certainly not intended.

Also there's black and yellow at the back and I really don't want any part of me associated with ancaps. Not even my backside.
There's no real pattern, just a bunch of rectangles and triangles like [this](https://imgur.com/a/UrRvJSh). The idea is my own, but I'm probably not the first who thought of it. I'm still new to sewing and this was a great beginner's project.
That is awesome!!! Zippers are hard, but personally sewing circles (like apliques) are my absolute enemy 😆.  Good luck in your future sewing endeavors, it’s such a fun skill to learn!!
Still a pretty awesome skirt!
Awesome! Thank you so much for that top down image. I was really struggling to visualize how the pattern lays out so that helps so much!"	vnaxee	NonBinary	324	1.0	2022-06-29 08:38:09
Finally ironed and hung up my pride flag!		"Omg, an ironed flag, this is so rare in the LGBT community lmao
Oh that is so satisfying to see it so smooth! I hardly ever see anyone taking time to iron their flags
This made me immediately look at my rainbow flag and go ""Oooooh. You're supposed to iron them!""
It has literally never occurred to me to iron my flag
it almost feels cursed to see an ironed flag. it's not bad but it feels so weird n smooth
Oh I thought I was the only person to de-crease mine 😂
Giving the flag the honor it deserves, I salute you!
Do that few people have clothing irons? Dayum.
I finally come out so before there was no point to ironing it cuz I had it hidden folded up in my closet (along with myself). It’s so nice to be able to fly my true colours now!
Do it, it’ll look 10x better!
We are a wrinkly people
I think they're just lazy haha
This may be a dumb question, but how? I’m afraid it’d melt.

Woah looks amazing! Did you have a FNG? I can hardly tell if you did!
i actually love my scars! to me they’re a reminder of how far i’ve come and fought to get to where i am today. i understand not everyone likes their scars but not everyone hates them either :)

Thank you! :)
Thank you, I appreciate that :)
Lmaoooo yep she's good. Called out 😂
Oh no for some reason that makes me not want to tell you it lol!! Please don't throw away money if it's not something you genuinely want. And I'm always open to ideas too so if you've got an idea of some sort of design you'd like just shoot me a message and I can make it happen for you.

Here's the link: https://www.etsy.com/shop/EuphoriaPhactory
Thank you! :D
Aw man thank you, that's super nice :) I believe you'll get there bro!

It's dark grey heather! But it's available in other colors too.

It's Arctic Fox Aquamarine!
Where did you get it, it’s awesome!

Edit: jk I saw it’s from your shop, would also love the link!
I couldn't help myself haha. I'm glad 😊  where'd you get the shirt???
'Throw' in a positive sense ☺️ I'm basically collecting Enby shirts and I've got plenty of money to support someone being themselves. 😊
Thank you!! I think i have a similar base colour to you so I'll try it out!
Sure! It's in my bio, the one called Euphoria Phactory. In case it doesn't work, here's the link:

https://www.etsy.com/shop/EuphoriaPhactory
It's actually a sample from my own shop. I run a little Etsy store with pride stuff I design to save up money for top surgery. I occasionally get high off my own supply though lol 😅
Is it as soft as it looks? Trying to find more super-soft t-shirts for my collection, and an enby colors one would fit right in
Thats so cool. Whats the shop? I would love to check it out. The point of selling is to have some for yourself. I totally get it 😉
Yeah it's actually super soft! I accidentally fell asleep in it lol and it felt like PJs tbh.
Haha truth!! The link is in my profile, and I'll add it here too in case it doesn't work:

Some memes for pride month y’all		"When I was at Pride there was a tent giving away prizes for answering ""trivia"" questions. The question that came up for me was ""what is 'non-binary'?"" I said ""oh, oh, me"" and pointed to myself. I won a rainbow bracelet.
Do you lift or nah? Xd
That's beautiful 😂
Do you even lift, sib?
I lift the spirits of the dead, so that they won’t haunt me at night. 😎

Happy pride! 💛🤍💜🖤		"""No.""
[deleted]
*gestures  vaguely*
I’m an ✨experience✨

And if you’re not okay with that, you’re going to experience some pain.
Gasping in an offended manner and walking away is pretty much how I deal with everything
""I don't know, I've never checked.""

""I lost my gender in my last move.""

""Someone borrowed my gender in the second grade and I never got it back. I'm still pissed about it. Fuck you, Becky H.""

""No one knows.""

""My dog ate my gender.""

""My mom still won't tell me.""

""I think they're pronounced ""grill"" and ""buoy"". Why would I be a grill or a buoy?""

""Wouldn't you like to know?""

""I'm a nunya. As in nunya business.""

""Ha I'm not falling for that again, government spy.""

""What's a ""boyoragirl""? I'm sorry, I don't speak Spanish.""

""I went to the hospital for an appendectomy and they accidentally removed my gender instead of my appendix. I have a pending lawsuit.""

""Are you?""
“Depends, are we talkin fish or stars?”
i’d say “none of the above”
""no? with vivible confusion
""i guess"" with a resigned shrug
""probably not...anyway"" while redirecting the conversation
Come on... the best answers are the most ridiculous... you gotta practice them though.

""I'm an eldritch horror that predates the gender binary you mere mortals cling to as the foundation upon which you erect the facade of your identities. Ask me something more entertaining or begone mortal before I toy with you as an idle amusement grotesquely."" *nods sagely in a sinister fashion*
My favorite is 
""Why, you interested?""
definitely NOT
""You're one to challenge the fates."" Then walk away maintaining eye contact
""Yes.""
Also that. Definitely that. *points to your comment*
Bonus points if you are on an HRT regimen

its AMAZING! love the non binary make-up to go with it!
From one enby pansexual person to another, happy Pride!!

I'm loving the matching nonbinary nails and makeup!

Went to Pride but got sick from anxiety so I only got these selfies (they/them)		"So sorry you got sick at pride 😞😞 you look incredible in your pictures!! ☺️☺️
I also skipped most pride celebrating because of anxiety. Right there with you friend
That’s super valid, I always get wicked anxiety at pride. Happy you went anyway!! Happy pride!!
May be a dumb question… but I have double nose piercings as well. I’ve seen that chain thing before, does it have a specific name? Where do you order them? Super cute photos!!!
Ngl at first I thought you were Kat zun
Same! I wanted to attend pride this year after finally realizing i’m Enby, but couldn’t bc anxiety got the best of me 🥲

Onto next year…(hopefully!)
Damn, you look really great. That fit suits you very well
Looking cute as hell! I lov your nose piercing it's really cool 🤩👍
Happy Pride!
I feel you, I enjoy Pride but the noise and the crowds get really overwhelming especially with 90 degree weather.
Thank you so much! 😊
Same
Sorry to hear that friend, I hope you still got to enjoy some of the celebrations!
Ugh being isolated bc of the pandemic has made my anxiety so much worse 😫 I got to go for a little bit tho! Thank you 😊
Happy pride to you too!
Not a dumb question at all! I got mine from bodyartforms for a good price. I used a tape measurer to see how long I’d need, then ordered longer just in case! Then I had to cut it with wire cutters to get the right size. It also helps that I changed my nose jewelry to flat back labrets (titanium) so putting on the chain was very simple. Hopefully this helps! 😊
Try searching “nose chain”
I had to Google them, they’re an artist?
It can be so difficult! I hope you get to next year ❤️
Thank you I appreciate that 😄
Thank you so much ❤️
The anxiety is real - sorry you deal with that too

First is the outfit I wore for last weekend's pride and the second is this weekend's		"Impossible to pick what part of the outfit I like best so I guess I'll have to go with the model instead 😍
Ok first ur beautiful🥰🥰 2nd i'm so obssesed with ur skirt happy pride🖤🤍💜💛
Your hair is giving Cruella vibes!! You look absolutely stunning <3
I want to be able to wear a shirt open like that but how do you do that??? I have large boobs 🥲 it's a losing battle.
in love with the hair! im agender and rn i have half my natural colour (very dark brown nearly black) and the other half is blue.
Oh you look amaaaaazing everything about these outfits is stunning 😍🏳️‍🌈
Cool hair and boots! 👍 And is your hair multi-hued there?
You look amazing in both pictures?!!?!! I hope you have a great time! <3
I just got the same top from gc2b and wore it for the first time to pride last weekend! At one point a stranger came over just to tell me how much they liked it, which made my awesome day even better!
Love your hair!
I just love that outfit!!!
You look incredible in both 😍
Looking good.
You're too sweet! 🥰
Second that 🫣
Thanks 😊 Spencer's actually! I raided them first day of June lol
Trans Tape! I used their tutorial video by Beau. They have a video on how to flatten and lift to make them look like pecs. They're a 36DD and I'm a 32DD
Yes! The Webster wig was already white and black but I added clip on streaks of pink and blue throughout! 

ETA: ooooh the umbrella is also reflecting color into it
I saw another stranger who called out to me because they were wearing a half binder of the same brand and design! There's such a freaking camaraderie in the trans community i love it. 

First day of June I ravaged Spencer's for rainbow crap, which is actually where the second shirt and skirt are from. I (privately to myself) clocked the cashier as transmasc. I loved it because I didn't have to say a single word about it being pride. I'd say ""I just decided I want to be extra obnoxious this June"" and they just went ""lol fair enough."" After I checked out they wished me a happy Pride and I was just so happy from that exchange ^_^
Thanks! You can't tell in the pic but I clipped pink and blue locks in it throughout
There's hope??!! Thank you!!
Good point, I didn't even think of that. 🤔  Oh, and after taking a closer look at your name, by any chance are you a fan of Fluffle Puff?
OMFG you are the only person who has ever brought that up!! Thank you human
Sure thing! 😋  It was only on the second time around that I went: ""That name looks familiar..."", even though it's been years since I'd seen that video last. Nice meeting another fan in the wild! 😁👍"	vcmm7y	NonBinary	286	1.0	2022-06-15 04:58:08

My pride nails. Only took 2 hours and 17 colors of nail polish.		"!!!! These are so cool aaa
Dedication to the cute details. That's Pride AF.
I’m an idiot, what’s the green white purple one?
That's simultaneously gorgeous and also way too much work for me to recreate even though I want to steal this look. Nicely done!
✨✨✨ Are those flags representing you? I'm in love 😍😍😍 

*Might have to steal for my local pride, if that's ok😇
I see that ace flag and I appreciate it
If I could paint my nails I'd 100% do this!!!
Love
I love it!
woah, so gorgeous! 🌈❤️
Thank you
That’s dedication right there.
Awesome, I'm painting mine for Pride, but just in simple yellow/black/white/purple because your skills exceed mine by lots, I'm not even going attempt this :) xx very fun.
Thank you
Thank you. I usually avoid lines since they’re so time consuming, but this was worth it.
Genderqueer
Not an idiot-anyone who learns something new is automatically cooler that day.
Thank you. Doing my nails every week is my me time. But this was a lot even for me
They do. I pulled up a website with all the flags for reference. Knowing me I would have switched two colors or messed up one.

Feel free to do it. Just make sure you have plenty of time and patience.
Thank you
Ah, thank you

I saw your partner's post about that dress a couple of days ago too. Just want to say that they look so natural in it, really suits them and the outfit gives off a great vibe.

Everyone bailed on my social distance pride event the other day last minute and also I got broken up with but at least I looked cute		"Definitely look good 🏳️‍🌈 sorry to hear about the pride and breakup.
Get it fam! Sounds like it was some tough stuff, but also like you have resilience in spades. Keep up the absolute lewks and the good work <3
Ill social distance pride with you all the way from Holland! 🌍
Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. You have such a great look indeed, your accessory game is on point... it's a shame everything's just piling out on you.
So sorry about your breakup and being bailed on. I feel that in my soul.


(also can I say you’re transition goals? I’m weeping)
it’s okay, you’ll find that special someone someday
Fucking yikes, that *sucks*, man. Hope things are okay, and you do indeed look cute
I got to eat two whole pizzas by myself, it wasn't too bad haha
I don't know about resilience, but I do like to think I'm still alive and kicking mostly out of spite and because when I dress like this I'm too gay and powerful for death to catch me. So, you know, close enough?
I mean at least bright side I got to eat two whole pizzas myself
(Also holy shit that's the best compliment I have ever received I'm actually crying right now)
Either I will or I won't, but I WILL always have pizza. Which I'm fine with tbh
Hey that works out at least lol
Yeah I’d buy that. If you are not feeling resilience, I will totally support too gay and powerful for death to get ya. Definitely the energy I need in 2020."	h9tz43	NonBinary	283	0.99	2020-06-16 01:48:43

These are perfect!

I'll add this design to our list since my partner, whom I met through [TS Dates](https://datingadvocate.com/ts-dates), used to do my nails.
That's fucking amazing.
Cute! 
Really nice clean lines !
I love these nails!  I am feeling inspired to get mine done soon!
Thank you!! I had them done at a shop :)  I have a shakey hand and couldn't pull this off on my own.

Thoughts on this shirt? I'm making pride shirts/hoodies/etc to raise money for top surgery, and I had the idea for this one but I'm wondering if the joke is tasteless or could even be considered offensive? It gave me a chuckle but that doesn't always mean anything...		"I’m non-binary and I love it. Please do not refer to me, indeed. 😂
Go post this on r/agender and you'll make a mint. I would totes buy 🤣 Are you making zip hoodies?
I've met a few people who actually do use no pronouns and would rather not be referred to in general (some have verbatim quoted that shirt), so there shouldn't be any issues
Definitely made me laugh, I could see my dad buying me this as a joke because he's that kind of person (got me a phone case that basically says ""introverted but willing to talk about Kpop"" because he knows I love Kpop and it's one of the few things that brings me out of my shell, also accepting and cool) and it'd definitely make me chuckle again.
Made my nonbinary self smile, so it's got my thumbs up of approval!
I mean I think it’s funny. I’m genderfluid and my pronouns change all the time if that counts for anything. But I’m only one person so I’d get the opinions of other trans/nby people as well
i think this is a great joke, there’s a lot of lighthearted jokes surrounding gender that unfortunately get passed around negatively sometimes or that people take too much to heart. usually what matters is intention and context and i think that this is a lovely design
100% would buy, please make this!!! i relate so hard
I would buy it 😂
yeah please don't refer to me
I don't see how it could be offensive tbh. Maybe if it was confused with an ""I identify as an attack helicopter"" joke?
Agender Approved™️
On days where I don't use he/him, they/them is the kindness I afford people that must perceive me. I'd prefer if they didn't but I understand that's not always possible lol. All this to say I love it & it's very relatable lol
Every introvert ever.
I love it. I’ll take 10
Yeah it’s great haha
I’m into the whole non-binary nihilism and the “how dare you to perceive me!?” stuff, this is cool.

Edit: I JUST REALIZED YOU ARE THE SAME PERSON THAT MADE THAT BEANIE WITH A BEARD, I’M A BIG FAN NOW.
I think it’s funny! I love it
My pronoun is *whooooosh*
Definitely A Solid Shirt, Works Especially Well For Enbii With Social Anxiety!
People will get offended by anything. People will get offended that you didn't do anything offensive (""too woke""). The shirt is funny, and isn't objectively horrible. Do it!
I dont really think its a joke, if I saw this I would take it literally and assume the person had no pronouns and maybe go only by a name. Nothing wrong with it! But I dont find it ""funny""
I want one. It's great, sums up how I feel rather well.
can i buy one
I am amused.
Im non binary. And find it funny. I would wear it.
I saw the design before I saw the OP name, and instantly wondered if it was one of yours!! 

I was just writing a new into my tumblr last night that included basically “fuck gender, fuck pronouns, this is all too complicated” LOL so this fits right in with that
Haha thanks that's how I feel about it! Like, if I could just not be perceived, thank you, that would be nice.
Yeah I definitely could! With the zipper going straight through the words??
I'm almost to the point where I'd rather someone just say my name instead of messing up (when they know better) so this shirt is pretty hilarious to me.
Yeah, this... tho i do wonder if such folks cud see an issue here as it is mostly gonna be worn by pronoun users and thus kinda makes light of the life of a pronounless person; esp if worn by someone who doesnt actually believe that ppl can be pronounless and merely wears the shirt cuz absurdly funny joke.
Oh that's a cool thought! The idea of this being gifted from dad's to their non-binary children definitely makes me happy haha ☺️
Awesome, thank you for the thumbs up! :)
Thanks for the input! Every voice is helpful.
I'm so glad everyone here seems to like it, I was nervous! I went ahead and made it available in my shop after all, the shop is called www.etsy.com/shop/euphoriaphactory if you want to look at it! Thanks for responding :)
I love your username! Brielle may be like the nicest name I've ever heard 🥺

Thanks for the feedback though it's up on my Etsy now! I feel a lot better about putting it out there since people here were so cool about it.
Exactly. Despite appearances, I am not here and should not be referenced.
That was my main concern, I didn't want it to seem like I am making fun of the concept of sharing your pronouns. Like when cis people who don't understand what pronouns are object to anyone sharing theirs.
This approval is very prized and appreciated by me 🙏
Hahaha I love that this is my legacy - beard hats and non-binary nihilism!!!
That's me haha, probably why I thought of it!
That's a good point I think, thank you for making it. I think that settles it, I'll pull the trigger and put it up. I appreciate the feedback! :)
Sure! This is my shop: www.etsy.com/shop/EuphoriaPhactory it's pinned right at the top
This exactly! Nb here and I legit laughed out loud! Love it!
Words on the back maybe? Or the words where a shirt pocket goes?
I agree eith pocket size or back, although through the zipper would be fun when wearing an enby or aggie tshirt XD
You could throw a little enby pride flag in there somewhere to make it clear where you're coming from maybe?
That's a good thought, thank you! Maybe just something subtle to indicate the person wearing the shirt is an ally and/or non-binary/trans.
Maybe put the original text in enby pride colors or trans pride colors?
I like that idea a LOT! Thank you so much :)

In honor of pride month, I finally worked the guts up to post. First time in years I didn’t feel dysphoric in a dress, along with my first experience with a binder. So glad to have this community help me know I’m not alone.		"You look great both ways!!!
You are slaying!
You look amazing. My first pride month I came out a few months ago
I love the hair. I have thought about cutting mine even shorter like yours but I’m afraid I won’t pull it off!
You are so cute and inspiring !!!
sleek!
how did you get to the point where you didn’t feel dysphoric in a dress?! goals
You totally can! Best advice is to do it slowly and find a stylist that you trust. 2 years ago I had straight hair that went half way down my back. It slowly got shorter and shorter and styled differently. It’s been like this for a few months and it’s my favorite! I do it so many different ways and it’s pretty easy. I say go for it! It’s hair, it will always grow back!
I was a bridesmaid for a family member, so I knew about it ahead of time and mentally prepared myself.  I don’t think I could slip into any dress and feel great, this was more of a surprise. Having my short hair really helped. I just told myself it was like dressing up for Halloween and it wasn’t so bad. I was surprised that I ended up feeling really good in the outfit! I did feel dysphoric and weirded out after my makeup was applied, but I just rolled with it."	bwwokt	NonBinary	270	0.99	2019-06-05 01:08:19
Even my bike screams Nonbinary Pride		"Very cool!!!!!
I feel like I'd slip and faceplant over my handlebars if I rocked upside down bullhorns 😅

Love the fit, you have that ""oh wow that person looks super cool I wanna be their friend"" vibe

Thanks, the colors just go so well together. It's a perfect match💛🤍💜🖤"	see0tw	NonBinary	271	1.0	2022-01-28 01:03:04

Pride Festival! Wife, me and daughter on my back		"Awe I hope you guys had a wonderful time!
Wow I love your t shirts!
Omg what a cute gang !!! Hope you had a fun time

We did! It was excellent. We always seem to forget how much this makes us feel like ourselves unapologetically.

So many people complimented her skirt (I made her a super twirly swirl skirt in trans pride colors.
Hot Topic online
Aaaaaaaah! Hi!
That's so cool! I'm so happy you can all get out and be yourselves with the rest of us, and tbh it's so heartwarming to see a happy LGBT+ family, i'm glad it was so great!

No pride events where I live this year unfortunately, but I love your outfit.

Repping my pronoun/pride pins at work! Feeling extra visible today!		"this is the second time i’ve seen someone wearing my glasses on this sub lmao
Love both the pins and their location! You whole look is so sharp.
You look amazing cool pins
dude your eyes are so captivating!!
Yesssss, priiddeee
WHERE is that shirt from?! It's amazing, I swear I can never find cool shirts that fit my stupid afab body
Yoooo you got a link to those pins? I'd love to get me some!
Zenni does good work! And apparently enbies have similar taste😂😍🌈
I'm pretty sure it was from TJ Maxx? I've had really good luck there for short sleeve button ups
I have the same pronoun pin! Made by [Gamut Pins on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/GamutPins)
Unfortunately they were both gifts so I dont have a link.
yeah i think most enbies have some brand of round glasses 😂
Awesome thanks!
Aw too bad :/ you wear them well though 👍🏻"	i3pxs5	NonBinary	247	1.0	2020-08-04 19:27:39

Wow, ready cool. And you're welcome :) <3
Yo, that’s sick. 
My gf has designed some of my tattoos, but it’d be awesome if she could fully tattoo them on me.

I know it’s months until pride, but I had this idea last night for a sign/poster and I just finished the sketch! That do you think?? The quote is from Voltron Legendary Defender.		"This is awesome!
i love it! i love the idea behind it too. i mean, we all are!
You should make it into a t-shirt! Looks rad
This is brilliant. Would look ace on a hoodie or as a patch
I absolutely adore it!

At first I read *communist dust* and was confused, but only about the last word.
Amazing!
You really think so?? Thanks !!!!
You people are the sweetest! I might just do something about these requests to sell this as clothing and patches!!
I'd buy it !
I think so too! I'd totally wear it
