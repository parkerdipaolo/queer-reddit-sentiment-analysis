Oh look it's my favorite combo, fatphobia and gatekeeping! (both medical and within the queer community itself) SO delightful.	"
I'm REALLY fucking tired of this. Being too fat for insurance-based transition requirements doesn't make me cis. Not explaining my entire medical history to some rando demanding an explanation of why I'm not on hormones/surgery yet if I'm ""really trans"" definitely doesn't make me cis. 

*Every* surgery and even some hormone treatments are gatekept behind weight requirements. I can't even get a consultation for hormones until I lose a hundred pounds (medicaid is ass, they won't cover anything anyway).  I've faced a lot of judgment from *within my own community* for not ""starting"" a transition yet, with a lot of subtle implications that yep, it's my fault for not getting skinny to 'earn' my transition. Obviously I must not want it bad enough if I can't lose weight to qualify just to TALK to a doctor about transition! And the way that people will tell you to your face that you're valid even if you never plan on physical transition or hormones, and then those same people talk shit behind your back because you're not transitioning/are a ""permapre""... *you can stop at any time* and yet. AND YET!

The level of harassment I've gotten from other queer folk for being a ""pre"" (one of them literally used the name ""post-op"" to send me hate speech) is fucking surreal. Attacking and blaming me for the medical gatekeeping of which I am a victim = a foul fucking look for you. Harassing anyone because they're not trans enough for your standards is transmedicalist bullshit. No one has to get surgery or go on hormones to be a trans person! But at least once a week someone is being shitty to me because I'm a trans person who hasn't yet/can't do those things. 

Boiled over because an offhand comment from some piece of shit about how the post-op photo channel is more enjoyable because it only includes bodies that are a specific ""trans aesthetic"" which includes thinness (but as she was desperate to clarify, NOT whiteness! lol. nice try, Gabby), and the fact that not a single person even seemed to notice/have a problem with her obsession with size while they were attacking her for perceived racism.  

 I'm *still* seething over my doc's refusal to refer me for assessment because of my weight, despite the length of time it'll take to go from paper referral to actual assessment, and then the years it takes to go from that to surgery. 

I have a long history of eating disorders and self-harm through calorie restriction. Every doctor I have knows this; the current one knows I use caffeine pills and nicotine patches to prevent weight gain but still won't prescribe my correct medication (bupropion, 300mg/day) instead, no matter how reasonably I try to explain that I'd much rather have my actual meds than nicotine patches. 

Medical neglect and abuse are so much more common than you'd ever expect. It's always so shocking to those of a wealth/class who actually GET medical care, who assume everyone else does too just because of that sign in the ER, to learn how much is completely inaccessible to me because I can't pay, can't get magically skinny overnight, or a combination of both. 

Anyway I'm about to spiral into ideation over weight gain leaving me even further from transition goals, and the stress of my own community getting all gleeful about it and how relieved they are to never have to see a body this size in their post-op photos. 


Any time anyone feels the need or even just the desire to judge someone else for not transitioning far enough/fast enough/at all: try SHUTTING THE FUCK UP! instead :D :D :D"	"I also want to mention that HRT and surgery is not mandatory to be transgender. Some don't have that privilege,  some don't want or need it, some don't have access,  some are physically unable to etc. Real privileged garbage to gatekeep people in a minority community like that. 

I have been binding for over 7 years and my back is so fucked. I had preexisting back problems so binding is something i only do when friends come over (basically never at this point) or i go anywhere in public. I got a WFH job that has helped my back out dramatically since i no longer have to bind for 12 hours or more on work days. Binding/back pain additionally makes working out and going out in general so difficult. I have been trying to do more mobility related things like stretching to aid in my ability to exercise. 

I am not trying to tell you to exercise, I merely am just relating to your frustration in how I am similarly experiencing the same bs.
Every time I look for support online for dysphoria or my hopelessness about transition, people give lots of advice on how to talk to a doctor or find medical care or what steps to research, informed consent and online pharmaceutical delivery and-

&#x200B;

I have no healthcare access. I have not seen a doctor for any reason in over ten years. All of my money is spent on food and bills- I don't even get birthday presents anymore. I am essentially *already a trans refugee in Canada*, and it is meaningless. I'm not angry at those who want to give advice- but damn it'd be nice if that advice wasn't always 'take advantage of the privileges you obviously have'.

&#x200B;

For the record, I also expect any doctor to tell me I need to lose weight despite the fact that I'm down more than 100 lbs. I carry so much extra skin from being overweight that everyone I see assumes that I am gaining, not losing, and defending yourself from fatphobes is pointless.
i‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through that, medical neglect and fatphobia in the medical and queer communities are absolutely abhorrent and you don‚Äôt deserve that. üíó

i‚Äôm not transitioning medically, and i don‚Äôt have the same weight experience as you, but i‚Äôve been on the receiving end of fatphobia from other queer people who think they‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter‚Äù just because they‚Äôre skinny/have transitioned medically/etc. And it‚Äôs literally SO fucked up. it‚Äôs disgusting that people in our own community will choose such cruelty over caring for other community members.

you deserve so much better. üíõüíõüíõ
One fat trans person to another, I get it. Every community I'm a part of fails me in one way or another. When I first developed arthritis and went to my doctor complaining about joint pain, the first thing she said was ""you need to lose weight before your knees can get better""

...the joints that hurt were not the knees. Not the ankles either. I had pain in my fingers, toes and wrists. But I stated joint pain when the receptionist asked for reason for visit and the doctor assumed which joints were hurting and why without even bothering to talk to me about it. 

I went to a gynecologist because my periods just never stopped. I bled approximately 28 days a month. And the only thing the gyn could say to me was ""the only reason this is happening to you is your weight. Do you eat everything in front of you?""

I'm lucky I was able to afford to go to a different gyn the next week. I know many who would have had to save up for a single appointment and then give up for several more months until they could save up for another one. 

The way the system works here, I got a letter from a WPATH certified psychologist and went straight to the sexual health clinic. I'm lucky I ended up with a doctor who gave me some warnings about weight control, but still gave me my HRT. If my PCP had to refer me, I'm not sure she would have. 

Medical fatphobia is probably the worst part of being fat. I haven't really talked to many transmeds so I haven't had the same treatment from this community as you have. That doesn't mean I don't believe you or that I discount your experiences. I fully believe that all this did happen to you. And the world fucking sucks. 

Be fat, be trans, be a poc in a white majority place, be afab, be mentally ill...and no doctor knows shit about what to do with you. So for any given symptom, they'll blame one of three things: your uterus/hormones, your weight, or your mental illness. Now that I'm medically transitioning, the list also includes HRT. And then they refuse to do further testing or treatment because either ""you need to lose weight"", or ""it's all in your head"", or ""it's hormonal and you're already being treated for it"". It's fucking bullshit.
This absolutely sucks and is a part of a failing system for transgender people. 

Insurance companies are scummy, including the underfunded and poorly run medicaid/Medicare. I have seen so many necessary surgeries,  treatments, and mobility devices denied by insurance, both private and not. 

I have been morbidly obese for over 20 years. My weight has always been a problem. T has helped with muscle gain, but I am still 284 pounds. I fo home workouts and treadmill cardio. I know if I had top surgery, I would be able to go to the gym and do more as well as get out of the house more to walk and explore. My dysphoria puts me in a prison of not going out and hiding myself away. I have lost inches on my torso, but my weight remains the same due to muscle conversion and density difference between fat and muscle. It's a long, slow, painful process that I wish i did not have to go through. I wish us heavy dudes could get top surgery and that we did not get blocked off from it due to our weight. You know what keeps me fat? My tits that I need gone. It's like they expect you to 1. Not be fat, which is bs if a person is happy with their body that way and 2. Magically, get over the physical barrier that is having breasts. It's illogical bs. 

I am also sorry that queer people in your life have let you down and caused harm. Unfortunately queer people are like every other type of human in that they can be just as shitty, great, smart, stupid, prejudiced,  welcoming, etc, as anyone else.
Damn I'm not in your shoes but yeah the fatphobia sure does fucking suck, even just by being in the ""splash zone"". Doctors constantly dismiss my desire to gain more weight, gaslight me when I say gaining weight reduces my symptoms, and congratulate me for not getting weight gain side effects of medications. 

Like bitch! I've had issues with calorie restriction all my life! I have worked YEARS to gain the little I have! Skinny does not equal healthy! Shit, the majority of fat people are probably healthier than me, but the reason treatment models are less effective on fat people is because you *refuse to fucking treat them* until it's a crisis rather than catching it early!

I've carry around a binder with all my medical information in it and a notebook to my doc appts. I started just because I have memory issues, but I noticed how doctors take me more seriously with it, less questioning. Seeing the paperwork alone makes doctors sit up, but *nothing* like when I start writing notes. I know it isn't much, but every little bit to make doc appts less like the seventh circle of hell helps.
I can't upvote this enough. Transmedicalist gatekeepers are sickening. Do what you want to do when you want to do it. The doctors making weight loss a condition of operating on you is pretty gross. And it is grounded in Bryan, white supremacist notions of what constitutes a healthy and fit body. So much bullshit.

Absofuckinglutely! I'm so sorry you have people like this around you trying to tear you down. 

Idealization of thin bodies is so rampant across all communities and is continually apart of trans communities about trying to be the ""model trans person"". And also like you noticed, White. It's so frustrating to see those who face oppression, try and justify oppression of people in other minority groups.
its so fucked up. nobody deserves to go through what you're going through, and the fact that it's all avoidable/literally done on purpose is just so infuriating and evil. its just layer after layer after layer...sometimes i feel like healthcare is for the opposite of health
Oh no.

The shrinks will give you that buproprion prescription based solely on you being stressed out about what life is throwing at you.

Or at least they did for me about 20 years ago.  

It took seeing a clinical social worker,  then their referral to the psychiatrist, and the primary care schmuck had nothing to do with it.
Fat phobia is horrible, especially from doctors! My aunt was overweight and every time something was wrong she was just told to loose 50 pounds (and she was trying!) turns out she had a gallbladder issue that ended in surgery which made her drop a ton of weight and only now do her doctors occasionally listen to her! And yes, high weight can lead to issues depending on where it falls (fat on your organs can be dangerous but fat thighs or arms won‚Äôt hurt you) but that‚Äôs no excuse for everyone to completely ignore the actual issue!
I was working with a fellow enby on a project and the people working in our building would come talk to us. They would misgender just me and I mentioned it to my enby colleague. Their response? ‚ÄúWell, if you did HRT, you wouldn‚Äôt get misgendered as often.‚Äù ‚Ä¶huh???
What state are you in? I've never heard of bmi for hormones, was that because of the doctor or state regulation? I don't know if you're trying to get E or T but T makes it easier to lose weight so they would be a stupid reason to deny thai.
This is honestly such a good post. I honestly feel so dysphoric about my fatness because of shit like this. Like one nonbinary person a long time ago even told me ""you would pass much better if you lost weight"" which is just so much more fucked up hearing that from another nonbinary person. 

Also... *""permapre""* sounds so utterly disgusting, like a straight up transphobic slur coined by truscum. I'll be honest, even I feel like no matter how radically inclusive the majority of the trans community claims to be, theres still a serious truscum problem in a ton of areas that are still underaddressed. I'll still see it through micro aggressive behaviors that even make me feel isolated for not having medically transitioned yet even tho theres a lot of personal reasons why i havent. (Ive tried to in the past, but was in extremely unsafe environments to do so) 

I also knew a trans woman of color who was gatekept from taking HRT because of her weight. There was nothing medically wrong with her either, she took a bunch of tests and was perfectly healthy!! Medical fatphobia is an actual thing even within trans health care, it's honestly despicable. If you need access to hormones still, there's this one app I keep hearing about that might help you access that care.

I really hope this helps!!
no one is entitled to information about you!! im sorry you had to go through this you dont deserve it. you should get the same treatments as any cis/‚Äòskinny‚Äô person and its unbelievably unfair.
üò¢ hugs?
sending u 50000 fat-armed hugs, I know it probably sounds cheesy at this point but your experiences are fucking valid and anyone who thinks otherwise bc they want to cover up their medical eugenicism with truscum ideology needs to go step on an infinite hallway of legos. fucking dickwads. I'm so sorry you're going through this and I wish I could actually help-help but I just want to really assure that you are NOT alone and I'd go yell at doctors for you if I could. I'm so so sorry this is happening to you and that people decide to make it worse instead of doing the bare minimum of shutting the hell up
everything about this sucks, im sorry this is happening 

I think we as a community need to prioritize bodily autonomy in our personal philosophies and praxis. and we need to be proselytizing on this to other trans ppl. in other words, we need build a culture of mind your own dam business.
I'm sorry the system is failing you. I want to validate your anger. I've also experienced fat phobia and can't get an appt for breast reduction until I'm at a bmi of 27, eventhough bmi is bullshit and I've had 2 back surgeries. We shouldn't have to fight to make these decisions for ourselves.
Hi Laeiryn, I'm not medically transitioning yet despite being 28 and having begun to feel comfortable gender questioning as a 20 year old. I've experienced medical gatekeeping too, also not related to my transition goals. 

The NHS told me despite a manual wheelchair not being appropriate for me, they won't fund for me to get an electric wheelchair (my Dad then privately bought me one plus ramps to get in/out my house). I can't live move that far without one. I also have an eating disorder history, and the NHS diagnosed me then didn't help because they expected my boyfriend to be an appropriate substitute for actually healthcare assistance with it. 

I only started putting things in motion with medical transitioning in the past few months because I was living with the boyfriend I was dependent on for my eating disorder for 5 years. He wouldn't let me break up with him, and he wouldn't tolerate me dressing in a transmasculine way at all (I didn't realise he was a transphobe until I was already living with him, as him seemed supportive to me for over a year before we moved in together). So I had to hide my ""trans-ness"" from him until a lgbt+ group helped me get confident enough to end things with him and get him to move out my home.
Hi! I have been there with medical fatphobia. I have a consultation for top surgery on Tuesday and I‚Äôm bracing myself for them to say no. I also am having a hard time finding images to share with the surgeon (if he allows me to have this procedure) because no one posts their images due to fatphobia. I echo the sentiments of another commenter ‚Äî our community lacks intersectionality in this area and it sucks. Sending lots of love to you, OP!!!!!!!
I am sorry that where you are fails you as so many other places do. You are right, the access and ability is a privilege. Having that privilege makes whatever I say ineffective and maybe sounds insensitive to those that do not have it. I can only speak from my experience, so I guess I am not helpful.  

I hope for things to change for all within our community. I will continue to fight, go to organized protests and donate whenever I am not struggling paycheck to paycheck. I don't have much else to offer, apologies.
But also - you got onto T in the first place? Is it rude to ask how? Is my dilemma 99% just Medicaid desperately trying to shirk?  They won't even *give me a referral* to **start** the entire process of just getting the *intake and the counseling* until my BMI is under 35 (which for me is around 170 lbs - I'm pretty short). They sure as hell refuse to test my own natural hormone levels, much less give me prescription hormones - and ALL of this is something that can be done regardless of a person's weight (they just have to, i dunno, do their jobs and figure the maths they paid to learn in uni and figure out how much hormone a 205lb body needs instead of a 170lb one, it's extremely fucking possible). 

Escape to a land with real healthcare if you can!
Honestly, this aspect of my experience of medical neglect as a trans person is just a symptom of a truly insidious form of systematic discrimination (fatphobia), which is just rearing its head anywhere it can. 

But the part where people in the trans community (even literally right here on my post) are going ""wELL ACKSHULLY THEY'RE RIGHT"" is honestly way more hurtful. No, I don't need to be below a certain BMI for *referrals, intake screenings, or psych evals*, and it's pretty disgusting that anyone would advocate for that.
This wasn't intended as a honeypot for exactly the kind of asshole I'm talking about, yet fruitful it has been.
*you're not wrong*    hngggggk I'm almost 40 aren't I too old for this bullshit?
(ETA: usually they do, since it's a REALLY reasonable rx, but between the last individual being fucking terrible and the pandemic, i've been off meds for several years)

I've done that a few times; last round was an 18 month waiting list that got me an intake interview aaaaaand then the shrink refusing to give me anything at all, which is why I've been off my meds the whole time it wasn't being renewed (the interim while waiting after the previous one ran out) as well as since that particular instance of malpractice (over three years now, since that was right before the pandemic took off). I'm on another list now for the only other counselor at the center that medicaid will cover/transport me to, but they have the same file from the previous one and my hopes aren't high for getting any of the care I actually need.
That's just. Infuriating.
He couldn't tell me what policy or entity had such a requirement, and so may have been lying about it. Possibly just a patent transphobe, there's really no way to know. I start fresh every appointment with a different ""PCP"". Next appointment: only seven months left!
It's not rude to ask me. I am very open about things. I have the privilege of living in  blue state (Massachusetts) and was able to get my PCP as a doctor that is in the transgender medicine center. I used to be on Medicaid when I was more poor and qualified for it. Medicaid is accepted by this clinic. I can't speak for how other states and clinics accept medicaid because, unfortunately, it varies wildly. I just had to do a lot of research seeing who accepts it out of the best options for care that I found. A whole lot of googling endocrinologists, pcps and surgeons to check their experience and history with transfolx. 

My process was incredibly easy, and I did not have to push for anything. I registered myself as a patient with the PCP, when I went in he asked me about my history of transgender care was (none) and if I was doing anything like binding (I was) or anything else for my transition. He asked me about my expectations and goals, which is a very important  questions. Some people expect they can pick and choose side effects, expect to get big/small, expect a full beard etc. The truth is you can't expect anything of your transition like how any preteen can expect anything specific about their hormonal changes. He said my openness and lack of pointed expectations is really healthy and encouraging, so it made him feel very comfortable prescribing it to me and bumping the dose up whenever I want pending labs. He then put an order for labs, which makes sense and is required for most if not all medication additions or changes. I think sometimes people can have unrealistic expectations of transition that hurt.themselves and can delay their access to hormones if the provider thinks the patient is treating the prescription like a magic lamp. I am not saying this is your situation but I see many young transmen compare themselves to others and expect to have the same outcome/progress when the entirety of biology/genetics/hormone expression is not in our control and cannot be predicted. 


I would recommend you seek out a transgender friendly clinic be it planned parent hood or a well recommended transgender friendly provider. Ask them what they know about medicaid denials and obstacles for care. You could contact Medicaid to get a defined list of requirements that you must full fill in writing. I would also review what the WPATH guidelines are for meeting your care needs. 

If you aren't in the US then I apologize for the assumption. You would be best to reach out to local transgender community to see how people deal with your situation because you are not the only one that is affected. I am short as well and weigh considerably more than you, so it's pretty bs I get HRT and you don't.
Which is supremely, infuriatingly stupid given that BMI is such a particularly malignant metric that is not useful for much more than discrimination [[Source]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2930234/#sec-2title). I‚Äôm so sorry that this is your experience
I forgot to add that it was really important during the discussion with my doctor that I had been ""living as transgender for several years and binding"".
yeah man the supposed ""inability"" to treat us fucking deep fries my brain every time. so you're saying you suck at your job so much that you can't treat half of the population? the fuck do you have that license for?
The whole ""sleep apnea "" argument is stupid. There are tests and ways to work with it if that is present as an issue in the patient. The fact that trans healthcare access is vital to life means that I should be allowed to sign off, acknowledge the risk and accept responsibility for it so I can get the damn surgery. Otherwise, I am supposed to be trapped as I am with increasing depression and back problems? How is that ethical health care. People sign off that sort of risk for other lesser import surgeries. I had two sinus surgeries at this weight that were not a critical need and nowhere near the fraction of a single percent of importance as my top surgery need is. This is really some insurance gate keeping shit with medical professionals and queer people alike regurgitating it as an excuse to deny care. As an excuse to shut us down when we lament the denial of care we need. It keeps our gender affirming care in some pseudo elective category rather than as the vital life-saving category it deserves. 

I am willing to risk my life to get these breasts off more than my stupid sinus surgeries. My life is at risk not getting the care I need.
Listen I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever recover after my obgyn told me to lose 30lbs before I even opened my legs. 

Idk if I have 30lbs of vagina
That sucks big time. 

I remember telling the counselor that I'd discovered that alcohol masked my my feeling so stressed out that I couldn't concentrate on anything. 

I described getting buzzed at a party and how fantastic not feeling the stress malaise was.
  
 It took like 2 visits to get on the short wait list for the real psychiatrist and another 2 visits with him to get the buproprion script.   The implied alcoholism danger may have been an alert condition for them. 
Or maybe the wait times are always like 3 months out,  unless it's coming from a colleague. I got another story for that suspicion. 

I also won't ever ask for a particular drug. I may ask about a drug during the psychiatrist session, but I think actually asking may throw a flag.
Are you in an informed consent state? Planned parenthood is another place you can go to get on hormones.
I mean, I know there's a very real threshold over which full anesthesia is dangerous, but that's so separate from where I am right now (nowhere near surgeries?) that insisting it matters is so obnoxious T_T
Well, you would think it might be a risk, but when it's someone who has a 5 year history of being on it at that exact dose and almost 10 years of taking it total, and that person is going, ""Uh, yes, I'd like to not be deprived of the thing that it took a long ass time to figure out worked better than the other various options,"" usually they're pretty good about keeping you on a med that's working. Especially because, to anyone who knows anything about meds and drugs, that drug at that dose is supremely reasonable for a long-term Rx. That was honestly the first time the psych DIDN'T seem relieved that a low-grade drug was sufficient.
Wait times are shittier now post pandemic because the massive back log from all the delays/cancelations during the height of covid. Even my allergist appointment made me wait a year from when I made the appointment.
Mmmmm you know they're the only place that didn't misgender the fuck out of me when I went in for testing (get tested if you're active!) and they did accept medicaid at the time. I'll look into that, thank you!
Absolutely, and I'm not saying that fat folks don't have unique health considerations (just like skinny folks do), just that 1) Goodhart's Law (when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure) is a real social phenomenon and 2) The construction of the measure of BMI, being proportional to the square of a person's height (as opposed to something more sensible like the cube of a person's height, aligning it more with a notion of body volume) introduces a bias favoring taller people.
Rule of thumb for trans care, if they don't respect your identity don't waste your time with them. I'm sorry the quack was gatekeepering you. Maybe they can help with the bupropion too.
And one that favors certain ethnic backgrounds and a LOT of other factors, too. As a measuring tool, it's pretty useless."	12lvzp2	NonBinary	277	0.94	2023-04-14 12:42:52
I'm an enbunny and I'm proud goddammit	"After ""cracking"" in September of last year, I've come to the conclusion that I am not a male nor a female. Sure if I HAD to pick one I'd probably go with female, but ultimately I don't really care enough to go through a binary transition. The thought of looking androgynous and confusing tf out of people delights me far more than the thought of ""passing"" as female, even if they'll probably assume my gender after I open my mouth.

realizing your gender is yours and yours only is so freeing. and so is seeing people who have realized this.

this post was made after seeing a fully transitioned transmasc who still uses she/her and idk why but something clicked. don‚Äôt even know what. but i just love seeing peoples unique identities i love seeing people live authentically and i love seeing people be themselves without caring about other peoples opinions (as someone who currently cares a little too much about other peoples opinions). idk. i just love people, seeing people be free from gender norms is so freeing and i genuinely feel bad that exclusionists will never feel that type of joy. rant over."	"idk just with all the transphobia in the world, even in our own community, seeing other gnc people living authentically despite everything is so nice. your transness is your own and so are your experiences. i hope when i‚Äôm fully comfortable in my identity i can make others feel this way too.
Yessss. It was so freeing when I realized that I was never going to be a certain gender that other people also are. That I can be everything, that I can be nothing, that I can be exactly the pieces that I already am in the way that I am and I can be exactly the pieces that I pick from the medical and societal changes that I want and that show me off, and nobody else gets to police that or tell me I'm experiencing myself wrong. I can be everything. I am everything. I am nothing. I've always been. I'll be for as long as I can. I've already won, I've already succeeded.
I only recently realized that i‚Äôm not strictly a girl or a guy, it‚Äôs such a neat feeling to just be me.
Many studies show that asking participants to fill out their gender on a self evaluation tests actually affects their self-perception on said test. Simply being reminded of their gender and society's expectations of their gender made women rate their math skills lower and men rate their artistic skills lower.

I love detaching myself from any concept of gender. I love seeing my skills and positive attributes for what they are. I love being unclouded from gendered concepts of what I should or shouldn't try. Freeing is the exact word I use.

He used my pronouns for the first time!	"I don‚Äôt know if it was on purpose or not, but when speaking to our son, my husband referred to me as ‚Äúthey‚Äù vs ‚Äúshe‚Äù.

It took a beat but when it clicked I was really happy. I‚Äôve been out since Jan. 2021 and he was the first person I spoke with. I have frequent ‚Äúcheck-ins‚Äù with him about my presentation, as I suppress the more masculine presentation as I understand he is heterosexual and that is not something he is okay with. Being fluid I can swing androgynous or femme with him and I don‚Äôt experience dysphoria.

I have just started using my pronouns at home with our son, but still use ‚Äúmom‚Äù as he is autistic and 6, and I want to avoid throwing too many complex concepts at him. Developmentally, he is just learning to understand I am, in fact, ma/mommy, that is enough for me.

But to hear this man, who just usually doesn‚Äôt care, acknowledge and use this 4 letter word‚Ä¶.the euphoria was so great!

I‚Äôm misgendered with my immediate family (it‚Äôs okay, they don‚Äôt understand I think), work is weird as I‚Äôm transitioning from she/they to they/them and present femme‚Ä¶but ahhh he used the right one.


Sorry for the infodump. I‚Äôm just so very happy."	"Yays for you!!

I guess I'm non-binary, and that feels great	"Hey y'all.

I'm Robyn, I'm 28, thought for the longest time I was just a cis-guy with no emotions, realized that's not right, then realized I was actually maybe kind of a transgender girl. So, since the beginning of the year I've been moving forward with that transition, coming out to friends and family, moving forward with getting HRT...

...and yet there was always this nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I wasn't doing things right. I figured it was just my dysphoric brain screwing with me, and that things would be better after I started HRT. And, I was half right, actually. Going on HRT cleared my mind and made me feel like *me* for the first time since when I was a little kid.

But that weird nagging feeling remained. It was like there was this barrier between me and transgender women. Like, a lot of their experiences about discovering their femininity didn't resonate with me. I like presenting as androgynous, there are some stereotypically male things I like, and I never really felt comfortable considering myself as a ""woman"". 

I thought that it might be I'm just butch, or that I've got some form of internalized transphobia to overcome, but neither of those felt right. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I just want to be a cute, slightly androgynous soft-butch tomboy and not have to act womanly or be male.

I talked a bit with some NB people I knew, and I felt that sense of connection that I was failing to get with binary trans women (or with cis-men) and I kind of realized that...hey, maybe this works for me as well?

So I guess I'm some sort of mess of a transfemme non-binary demigirl wibbly wobbly...thingy. Though, I don't really care about the label so much as the fact that I realized I can be feminine without being female, and it's liberating. It's the same euphoria that I had when I realized I wasn't male.

If you got through all that text, then thanks. I've been working my way sorting through the way I feel about myself, and this place seemed like a good spot to drop by.

Peace and love, everyone. \^\^"	"Wow this is pretty much exactly how I feel, but you‚Äôve actually articulated it well. Thanks for posting this!
Hey Robyn, welcome :) I can relate to a lot of what you're sharing, with a few variations (and about a decade later lol). The lack of connecting to feeling like a woman is what kept me from fully processing my gender issues for so long. Now that I've come out and started really working on it, I feel more comfortable wanting to present in more of that soft butch/tomboy kind of space as well. I'm still working on it, I'm only about 3 therapy appoints in on working towards HRT and figuring out a lot of what I want out of transition. 

&#x200B;

Thanks for sharing.
Hey Robyn, sorry to hear that you're struggling a bit but it sounds like you're in the right path to figuring things out! Life is so weird and complicated. I feel you though on the lack of emotions and while I haven't done HRT, I think I'm scared to try for the same reasons you listed. Best of luck on your journey and kudos to you for already the first steps! 
Hi Robyn, welcome to the enby life. I can relate a lot to the connection with neither men, nor women, but finding out what works for you is great.

I hope you find your happy place and don't worry about labels ;) 
Thank you so much for this post. "	9m9m82	NonBinary	81	0.99	2018-10-07 23:02:35
Just another enby rant	"I‚Äôve come out to myself about 6 months ago. I‚Äôm a 22yo AFAB who is non binary. In my mind, I am sort of just in the middle. Personality tests told me I have a masculine thought process, and I‚Äôve always considered myself being sort of male since childhood.

Anyway that‚Äôs just a fact that I know, and I‚Äôve always known. Still, when I have tried to tell anyone they just don‚Äôt believe me. Nobody ever have. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm just another chick who wants to hang out with the guys, or that I want to be a special snowflake. 

I live in a liberal country that is not educated enough about the trans community. So everyone think they are accepting while in reality they really aren‚Äôt. At least not in my case.

But I‚Äôm okay with feminine pronouns and I can accept having a female body. At least for the most part. My true dysphoria is socially. I can‚Äôt stand it when someone expects me to act feminine, or when other people gender me socially. I live in a male dominated world (I study computer science) and I have to prove myself twice as much to earn half the recognition. And if I don‚Äôt act modest and timid then a lot of men tend to be disrespectful towards me. Asshats. They expect me to be so freakin caring and bat my eyelashes at them when I really want to call them an effin dickbag for treating me like their secretary. I‚Äôm not sure if this is a problem for all genders, or if it‚Äôs even gender related. But I hear a lot of women complaint about similiar things, so I draw my conclusions.

So just because no one believes me I‚Äôve considered just not coming out at all. The only thing I would REALLY want to change is my name, but I can‚Äôt really do that since the name I‚Äôd choose is 99.9% male name from Finland (I wonder who that 0,1% person was) and it would be weird for other people to call me that unless I transitioned completely. So I‚Äôm going to just do my own thing, then. I‚Äôm going to act and dress masculine when I feel like it, or even feminine if I want to. I don‚Äôt need to explain myself, as it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs buisness. Tomorrow I am going to get that tie with pineapples on it that I really want. So ha."	"Good for you! F people who treat you any differently/negatively because they perceive you to be a certain gender. 
It's not you, trust me. The IT field is full of asshats. I hope things get better for you!
This is super refreshing and relatable, so let me tell you that your feelings are valid and no one has a right to make you feel any differently! 
[deleted]
yay :) enjoy the pineapple tie
I‚Äôve started weight training as well! It helps me deal with a lot of stuff
Oh, another Finn at nonbinary, cool :D I'm also AFAB, still questioning a lot. Not feeling female and if there was a gender scale, I'd be little over the middle on the male side (like, not very masculine male). I also live my life currently socially as a female and can't see myself verbally coming out anytime soon. But I've promised myself to represent myself more truthfully trough clothing and stuff. 

I get very much that ""everything here is perfect for LGBT+ people""  mindset. I feel like language has part on it (I suppose your native is also Finnish?). Our language is so neutral on gender, that people feel it makes us automatically ""gender-friendly"", zero effort needed. Of course that's not true, and there's still some quite strongly preserved gender stereotypes and expectations - especially between the lines. 

What's the name you're thinking of? No need to tell tho ;) Have you thought of any gender-neutral name?

Have a nice week!
Fuck yeah! Just do whatever you want to do and rock on!!
I'm feeling this so much. Like, expected to be girly, cute, weak, innocent... It's like my body at it's natural state screams for these features. I'm happy to hear you're reached what you wanted!
Thank you I will! :)
Hey there! I‚Äôm not a Finn, actually. I am a Norwegian Sami with a lot of relatives from Finland. I don‚Äôt actually speak the language, but if it‚Äôs anyhing like sami I know what you mean about it being gender neutral in a lot of ways. 

Still, it‚Äôs nice to hear from a fellow Scandinavian enby :D I hope you figure stuff out eventually. My best advice so far is to just give yourself enough time to figure out what feels most authentic and natural to you, then go for it.

When it comes to names, I haven‚Äôt actually found any gender neutral names that ¬´feels like me¬ª, if you get what I mean. This, I believe, is the main reason I still have my birth name.

The name that I would like to have, that would feel more authentic, is Levi. It‚Äôs close to my birth name, and doesn‚Äôt (in my opinion) have a super masculine feel to it.

According to Google, however, only 0,1% of all people with that name is female. So I think it would be inappropriate to take that name :P

What about you? Have you thought of any names yet that you would like to have? 
[Gender neutral baby names from Finland](https://imgur.com/gallery/vdmjF) 

I get the feeling that finding a gender-neutral name is easier said that done
Oh, I see. The same, it's nice to hear about people who live relatively close :) Finnish is one of most gender-neutral languages, we don't have gender pronouns (just ""h√§n"" for every human, and often in spoken language it's replaced with ""se"", which is a pronoun for items, animals and things). So gender does not pop up that often in the language, and if it gets mentioned, it's because of we're especially talking about gender.

Thanks :) I guess I'm lost because of I have just only recently started to think about my identity (so far I've just ignored my feelings). So probably I only need some time. I haven't thought of any practical changes, like name changes. Even though my birth name irritates me a little bit because of it's super womanlike and fussy, my closest people call me with my nickname which is not gender-tied, so it's fine for now. 

Levi sounds pretty nice, and not very masculine even though I also think it's nearly exclusively men's name. So you have to weight out which is more important; to have a name close to your birth name, or have a name that describes your gender identity. Do your name have any meaning? Maybe you could find a fitting name that had similar meaning, instead of phonemic similarity? If you're interested in Finnish gender-neutral names, this is the first [site](http://causavitae.blogspot.fi/2012/08/sukupuolineutraalit-nimet.html) that pops up. In the parenthesis there's first the quantity of men having that name and then women having that name. The writer of the article has colored those names red that sound more of girls' name and blue those that sound more boys' name in their opinion. Good luck!"	7udynx	NonBinary	59	0.99	2018-01-31 22:39:10
cis het guys keep mansplaining my own gender to me	"(tagged support, but it's also ranty)

The title kinda says it, basically. As I come out to more people I find it's my friends who are the least connected by direct personal experience to trans/queer identities who push back hardest -- the weird part being they do it in this way where it's like they're claiming to have *more* knowledge/understanding of trans/queer identities than I do. Like I've gotten a few versions of ""ehh idk, you don't seem trans to me, I think of you more as a kinda fem gay guy, did you even consider that as a possibility?"" And it's like... yes? I did actually? And I identified that way for a very long time even, *as I know you know because you have known me for years*? But now for social-dysphoria and body-dysphoria reasons that's not working anymore? I think you probably can't imagine how much time I've spent considering literally every possibility here? These are guys who take pride in how cool and open-minded they are and how important it is to them not to be too sure about anything they believe, but I start talking about transgender stuff and they become goddamn Socrates, demanding to be persuaded that every little feeling ""really means"" what it does mean to me and that I let them skeptically cross-examine me on everything as they flail around for a way to minimize and dismiss it all. It's exhausting.

It's almost like when I come to them with my feelings -- including honesty about where I'm uncertain, what I feel ambivalence/ambiguity about -- they see a Problem to leap on and Solve as quickly as possible, which they're gonna help me out with in a quick flash of awesome insight using Reason and Logic. (I'm invoking a jokey stereotype about men here, but the shoe does happen to fit fabulously.) When I share that sometimes ""I'm binary trans"" feels like a possibility, not in a ""lightning bolt of unshakeable certainty"" way but in a ""hmm, that *would* click a bunch of things into place"" way, that's like a bomb they have to defuse. They're hunched over the bomb sweating, holding wire cutters in their teeth, assuring me over and over that the bomb does not scare them in any way, that they ""don't care"" about the bomb, the bomb doesn't change anything, the bomb is really not a big deal at all, it's just do you really need to have this bomb here? Are you really completely sure this bomb is right for you?

I'm trying to look at this as simply their problem. Maybe they feel a threat to our friendship somehow. Or (to be more amateur-psychoanalyst about it), since they've had to figure out their own way to deal with masculinity and still identify with it, my own wish to purge myself of masculinity as much as possible suggests they *could* in some possible world want that too and that can be weird and scary to think about. But, these are friends I've been close to for a long time and so their skepticism, as obnoxious and insistent as it is, amps up insecurity I already have about transitioning and how much I can ""get away with.""

I want to avoid saying ""I just have too many cis het guy friends"" but I kinda suspect sometimes that I just have too many cis het guy friends.

Is anyone else running into this too? Does this resonate at all? Am I being overly sensitive or insecure? What do you think?"	"I think you kind of hit the nail on the head. As an AMAB enby/transfem I think a lot about how I'm deliberately disowning masculinity (which feels very liberating and refreshing for me) and how that probably makes cishet males uncomfy. But I tend not to give a shit, cause I'm so much better off for not trying to pretend I'm that way. :3 

One thing I have noticed is that I kind of can't tell what's worse -- men who deliberately avoid engaging with my identity or men who deliberately try to delegitimize it. I think in both cases they're desperately seeking to frame us as ""still one of the guys."" And I end up having a lot of trust issues. 

Tldr, you're fucking valid and your feelings are valid. Being around other people in the community can do wonders for self confidence and self love. Don't let the straights get you down! üíú
Cishet guys are the ""best"" at mansplaining, for real tho. I can't really say I've experienced this because I haven't come out to a lot of my friends, but that's part of the reason why, tbh. üòÖ My heart definitely goes out to you, friend. üò£
I‚Äôm a GNC female but I can‚Äôt help but notice the hilarious trend of cishet guys being the most condescending and having the tendency to mansplain. Like if someone says they identify a certain way or like using certain pronouns for themselves, nod your head, respect it and move on. It‚Äôs not a big deal and the world isn‚Äôt going to end otherwise.
I haven't come out to my friends yet, but I do know a few of them (also cishet guys) that have some strong beliefs regarding transgender people and just the LGBTQ+ community in general‚Äîand after reading through what's happening to you, I'm a little worried because it could be a realistic outcome (they're the type of people to have a discussion with teachers arguing against the gender spectrum, and by translation, indirectly against trans ppl).

I think that you may just have to give them time, and maybe by presenting (and however else you will transition) it will become normalized for them and they'll eventually get to be more accepting. You've probably heard this a thousand times for your transition, because I know I have, but in my experience giving people time during my transition (pretty small scale right now) has helped them come to understand a little better how I feel and intend to proceed.

Take this with a grain of salt though, my situation could be drastically different from yours, and only you know your friends and how they are. I really hope the best for you and your friends! <3"	ifsbdn	NonBinary	51	0.97	2020-08-24 16:30:14
Wanted to share something that's given me gender euphoria lately:	"Hey all I'm a long-time lurker, first time poster...just wanted to share some stuff that's been making me happy for awhile now gender-wise.

So during the summer I hung out for a little while with a new friend who was super comfortable with their nonbinary self and presenting however they wanted. I had been feeling increasingly uncomfortable with my own transition, having been on T for almost three years, initially out as nonbinary, but exploring masculinity/being a trans guy within that for quite some time. It was starting to chafe and just not feeling right, and I was noticing myself having a lot of anxiety over trying to be a man. As soon as I started hanging out with this person, all this kind of came to a head and a lot of things shifted for me and suddenly I just...didn't care as much?? Like I started feeling a lot lighter and like fuck it I can present however I want and not worry so much about passing or doing things ""right"" or whatever. I had also been contemplating stopping or reducing my T dose for sometime, and stopped it completely about three weeks ago.  


Since then I started thinking of myself as ""post-testosterone"" and every time I do I just feel really happy and right with myself. ""Post-testosterone,"" to me, doesn't mean that I'm better than those who are on hormones, or that I'll never go on T again - all it means to me is that I am who I am regardless of medical interventions, and I'm valid as a nonbinary person, as a guy, as however I feel, no matter what. I took T for awhile and it was right, and now I wanna be off T for awhile and that's right too. I don't know why this simple phrase brings me so much peace and contentment, but it does. I wanted to share in case it maybe resonates with others too. There's so much fraught feelings about whether someone is on or not on T, and about starting and stopping it, and so often if you stop medical interventions the only framework we have is ""detransition"" which is so often used against us. I'm not detransitioning. I'm post-testosterone, and I'm still trans, and I'm me."	"It's a really empowering experience, isn't it?  Learning not to care?  I had a very similar experience, started out thinking maybe I was a trans man but came to realize I was really just nonbinary and/or agender.  I took a break from testosterone thinking everyone would laugh at me for ""being wrong"" and ""detransitioning"" but literally none of my friends cared.  They all wanted to support me no matter what.  I ended up going back on T because I still do want to look more masculine than I can without it, but I feel so free knowing that taking testosterone doesn't make me a man any more than having ovaries made me a woman.  Medical interventions don't have to be a lifelong decision for everyone.
I went off T when I got pregnant, and I‚Äôve just never bothered to go back on it I guess? I‚Äôll probably go back on in the future but I‚Äôve got the beard I wanted and I‚Äôm good for now.
You nailed it: learning not to care.
exactly!!! :D
your beard continued to grow after going off T?  what?  JFC, why does T not do anything to me after years while other people literally stop taking it and still have the effects
It‚Äôs like how trans women who‚Äôve been through first puberty have to get their beards removed even if they‚Äôre on estrogen, the areas that have had hair growth don‚Äôt just stop growing hair. I had to explain this to a doctor recently. 

Then again I know cis guys who can‚Äôt even grow a moustache so I‚Äôm sure genetics plays a part. Have you been checked for androgen insensitivity? I‚Äôve heard of trans guys who are intersex with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome and T doesn‚Äôt work for them."	eg73q0	NonBinary	48	1.0	2019-12-27 05:43:29
Are anyone else's ideal existences as a nonbinary person to be nonbinary to the point of being nonhuman/not even applying human ideals of gender?	"I'm not agender, I'm nonbinary, as in I have a gender it just isn't one there's a name for. My transition goals are basically ""I don't know what you are but you're hot"" and I've found that the more I lose interest in pleasing the masses the more I'd like to just go ham with my appearance. I'm autistic and have always found myself to be very nontraditional in terms of almost everything, especially self expression. My relationships with my friends are hardly ever strictly platonic, every day I care less for sexuality labels and the limitations of a binary world, my habits are less influenced by typical standards and expectations, and I generally do whatever's best for me and what feels right.

If I could afford it, every outfit would just be akin to an ethereal being. Every outing I'd look like *that* guy you see at hot topic. The weirdo in the plague mask or the person who looks like a clown or a woodland creature or something. The sort where kids think I'm a fantasy creature, teens think I'm cosplaying, and adults probably think I'm a jobless lowlife, keeping it appropriate of course. The sort where I'd get posted to cringe subs for looking as weird as I want.

Of course I don't want to be shamed for self expression, but honestly when I see other people like that I want to be them. I think it takes a lot of confidence to be able to do that and I think it would be incredibly freeing to dress up all you'd like and feel happy about it, to not have to apply the standards of male and female beauty to yourself and just be what you want to be. I don't even want my sex or anatomy to be guessable, I want it to be the last thought in someone's head to try and figure out what my body is like behind it.

Not even in an ""I want attention"" sort of way either, I just think it'd be really fun and freeing to live that way. Even if it's an unattainable reality (which I personally don't feel like it is,) it's still a fantasy I like to daydream of sometime. I guess I just don't want to spend my life trying to conform to something I don't feel at home in, and if I'm already an outcast in life I'm going to live as happily with myself as I possibly can.

Does anyone else have any similar desires to express beauty or personal aesthetics in very nonstandard ways? If so, how do you express it or how would you like to express it?"	"You might wanna check out r/voidpunk
Yes, me :3  


I just want to look like an eldritch dragon creature at \*all times\*  


If I could present however I'd like I'd wear mostly a collection of goth and historical clothing and wearable art, always have blue and silver hair, get my ears pointed, have all-over tattooing, get a bunch more piercings, get my canines pointed, and wear dragon horns or half-masks everywhere. Oh, and claw jewelry. Lots of things. But mostly I just want to be clocked as 'not really human' and 'reminds me of dragons' and 'scary but hot'  


I'm slowly collecting stuff so I can be more openly 'me' all the time. Luckily my partner is the same, and I don't work, so I can get away with a lot of fun stuff  


Thanks for this post, it makes me braver to know we're out there
me. i do. literally exactly this.
Oh gosh yes; gimme functional tentacles and glow-in-the-dark contact lenses!

I want to wear the archetypal Link outfit from Legend of Zelda unironically. Tunic, hose snd cuffed boots? Yes please. I'm also drawn to being the most goth anyone could be. I had a minor goth phase in my late teens, and maybe being 30+ has driven me a little bonkers, but I want to do it again now I have the money to buy all the fanciest stuff.
This reminds me of Ye Olde Days (2009ish?) on AVEN when there was a forum thread on the topic ""what is your ideal body"", and the suggestions started out as physically possible human phenotypes but ended up as things like ""shape-shifting dragon"" and ""swarm of nanobot bees"".

Gender euphoria is a hell of a drug	"So, if you look at my posting history, you can see I'm going through the cliche post-egg-cracking crisis. ie, ""Wait, was this dysphoria? Was THAT dysphoria? Why are so many of these trans narratives so damn relatable?"" (Answers: yes, probably, and because some nonbinary people are also trans)

But I want to share something that might be helpful to other people starting their journey: dysphoria sucks, and while going down the rabbit hole of your past is kind of a necessary part of the process, it's extremely stressful and draining. 

But you know what's AMAZING? Gender euphoria. So I decided that I'm going to try to focus on what gives me that feeling, and let that be my guide. I started making a list of things that give me gender euphoria, as well as a list of things that I think might do so. I'm AFAB and really only now exploring my ""male"" side, so a lot of these are pretty masculine-coded:

**Things that give me male or non-binary gender euphoria:**

* Being referred to by ""they/them"" pronouns. (wowowowow, I did not expect this to feel so euphoric. I thought I didn't care about pronouns. I was wrong.)
* How my broad shoulders and small-ish boobs look in men's button-down shirts.
* Wearing this one button-down shirt that, due to the cut, makes me look flat-chested when I wear it. (THIS was a surprise)
* Man-spreading instead of sitting with my legs together (have only done this at home, not on the subway!)
* The fact that my speaking voice is low but my singing voice is a high soprano (very non-binary!)
* Connecting with other non-binary people, or binary trans people in early stages of transition, and feeling really connected to them.
* My big, blocky glasses

**Things I want to try:**

* Interested in binding, but going to start with a small sports bra
* Packing? (this seems scary but also really ... interesting)
* Wearing men's underwear
* Cutting my hair short (it's long and blonde and immediately marks me as a feminine woman)

Then I wanted to honor my female side, so I thought about **gender euphoria I've gotten from female things:**

* Female friendships, and feeling community with women, especially queer women
* Sometimes I love my girly hair
* Listening to good, feminine pop music, like Janelle Monae.

One of the cool things about exploring this way is that I've discovered I like things I never would have expected, like being referred to by certain pronouns, or how my shoulders look in a button-down. It's a really joyful and fun way to explore something that can be really heavy and scary. 

What gives you gender euphoria?"	"I'm AMAB and I'm discovering similar things as you lately.  I can relate with referring to they/them.  But I'll tell you what's been giving me so much relief lately is the fact that I shop in the women's section for bath products.  

I also wear light earth tones, enjoy having long hair and wear more femme glasses.  It feels amazing knowing that I can present however I want to.  Embracing the genderqueer/nonbinary label for me has meant letting go of so much shame that came with being a feminine man.  I don't even have to be ""man"" in any sense of the word and it feels great.

EDIT: The best part of all of this is that I do not have to hold myself to anybody's expectations.  It feels good.
EEE this post is so relatable honestlyyy

&#x200B;

I fricken loove my clothesss!! For the past 3 years i've subconsciously been buying androgynous clothes and i look BOMB in them!! They're all 80's aesthetic so hell yeahh
I completely relate to the whole ""Wait, was that dysphoria?"" thing, that was like the whole past year for me, looking back at most of my life. I haven't had many gender euphoric moments so far, unfortunately, since most of my dysphoria is based around my body and social stuff. I'm on HRT, low dose, and it's working slow. So my body isn't that different and people don't really view/treat me different yet. One thing that did make me euphoric, was hearing my kids use my proper pronouns in an excited and happy way. My wife and I took our kids to an outlet store and we split up to look at some stuff (I'm always in the kitchen isle) and I heard a little voice say ""There they are!"" and then a chorus of enthusiastic shouts and yells and saw my kids waving at me from a shopping cart across the store. That made my heart leap and put a smile on my face, which honestly isn't a feeling I get around gender all that much.
I like being referred to as they/them too! Painting my nails is good as well, and I wanna shave my legs but that would raise too many parental eyebrows :(

As far as music goes, Purity Ring gives me that feeling, oddly enough. Maybe cuz it's got badass instrumentals and super feminine vocals
I was experiencing dysphoria around my name for *years* without knowing it. It wasn‚Äôt until I found the name Parker and experienced ‚Äúoh. That me! I love that name! Why didn‚Äôt I know using a name I love could feel so good?‚Äù that I realized what gender euphoria really felt like. 

I almost cried when my friends sang happy birthday to Parker last week. 

Also: A short haircut. 

Growing body hair. I didn‚Äôt realize what a radical choice growing my body hair would be, but. Damn. I‚Äôm still getting used to even going out in public with armpit and leg hair. It‚Äôs a little scary.

Ive just about explored all my femininity that it doesn't give me euphoria but I love having longish nails and getting them done.

I love my long curly hair I'll never cut it .
I love showing off my fit body  and smallish curves

I didn't know there was a name for that feeling !
Can I ask why the voice thing is very non-binary? I'm very similar but don't totally understand the connection.
I have a button down shirt that I love wearing and usually wear for my androgynous selfies
Being referred to by they/them, being called a darling, people at my local gaming club joking about me being immune to the old he or she printings of cards in Magic The Gathering, that second look my hair gets in the loos, and seeing myself in the mirror stepping out of the shower and having wet hair sorta spilling down my chest in that way what happens to women in most every movie.

That is so awesome!! I have also been finding the same thing - I used to feel awkward about the ways I wasn‚Äôt feminine *enough* and embracing my more masc side in a proactive way is really healing.
That sounds rad. :)
Oh my gosh, that is so unbelievably sweet. It‚Äôs great that your family loves you so much as you are!
And what a great example for your kids.
Wow, I‚Äôm old and feeling comforted that kids still listen to Purity Ring, lol.
purity ring are so good
I haven‚Äôt shaved my legs for years (being blonde helps) but I think you‚Äôve inspired me to not shave my pits this summer. :)

I am just now realizing I may have some mild dysphoria around my name. I‚Äôve never identified strongly with it, partly because it‚Äôs extremely common in my generation (there were 4 in my elementary grade of 70) but also because it is VERY feminine.
It's a great concept! 

I love my wide shoulders now. And a friend called me bro yesterday and it made me so happy.
It‚Äôs probably just in my head, but I love that there‚Äôs this split. I have sung pretty seriously at several points in my life, and people always assume I‚Äôm an alto. It kinda delights me to be able to bust out with a Soprano I. I feel like it reflects the two sides of my gender identity.
Button downs are so good for gender euphoria if you're AFAB!
yeah they're super cool! my boi blank banshee sampled one of their live performances on his first album too, it's cool to see amazing artists inspire each other
will wtf i didn't expect to see you here! it's luke from the soundcloud twitter community lmao. your remix of textile fucks
Oh, that makes a lot of sense! I get that too.
Hahaha I haven‚Äôt even heard of that person (because old) but that‚Äôs great!
yeah ty! I‚Äôm still questioning atm but it‚Äôs really cool to see other people I know from other places online in this sub and r/traaa!!
for sure! it's great that there are supportive places to go on the interwebs"	bonbdm	NonBinary	42	0.95	2019-05-14 19:25:11
How do y‚Äôall deal with being misgendered constantly and the potential that people may never see your enby-ness?	"My parents were just here for 5 days to help take care of my son while I recovered from surgery (not top surgery unfortunately). The whole time they were here, they used the wrong pronouns. The first time I called them on it, the second day they were here, I just reminded them of my pronouns and asked them to use them. They apologized. Said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just hard for them to remember‚Äù üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ. 

Then they continued to use the wrong pronouns for the entire visit. I started correcting them *every time* they used the wrong pronouns and they just didn‚Äôt say anything and *continued* to use the wrong pronouns. 

They have told me they‚Äôre supportive of my gender and my medical transition. They‚Äôve told me they‚Äôre proud of me and my authenticity. Yet they cannot use my correct pronouns. And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs malicious. I don‚Äôt think they mean to. What I think is that they do ‚Äúlogically‚Äù accept me, but they still see me as my AGAB. When they use the wrong pronouns they don‚Äôt even notice. At all. Because they still see me as my AGAB and they *do not get* that *I am not my AGAB.* 

Then on top of that, I got publicly misgendered while streaming on twitch. 

And this got me thinking. People are still so stuck in the binary that most people will *never* see me for who I am. Because of my current body, they will *always* think I‚Äôm a woman. Because of my voice, most people will think I‚Äôm a woman.

I‚Äôve been on T for over six months (transmasc, not trans man), my gender presentation is very androgynous masc leaning, and my voice has started to drop. But everyone except my partner and closest friends still see me as a woman. Maybe a butch woman. But still a woman. 

And I‚Äôm spiraling because I feel *so* invisible and unseen. I‚Äôm so hurt by the idea that people will always see me through binary gender and especially on the side of that spectrum that I identify with the least.  

DAE feel this way? How do you deal with it?

Edit: the more I think about it the more I realize that part of what sucks so much is that I think more people in my life would be more supportive if I was doing a binary transition. Like if I said I was using he/him pronouns and chose a new name, I think people would misgender me less because that‚Äôs more comprehensible to most people. I feel like because people don‚Äôt get enby they think my gender and transition aren‚Äôt as valid and that hurts too."	"Same boat, and unfortunately don't have any advice.  My skittish is slightly different in that my dad openly denies my transition,  and my mom has just... stopped trying. My relationship with both of them has soured because of this,  and I basically only talk with them on an ""as needed"" basis at this point... it's especially painful because my mom and I were very close,  even after I came out to her,  but before I came out to my dad. But if they're going to constantly disrespect me... I just don't really want to interact with them anymore. 

Since your parents are openly supportive,  maybe have a heart-to-heart with them about how important using the right pronouns is to you?
In a sameish boat in that I currently am living mostly as my agab for safety reasons, and 'non-binary' will almost certainly not cross anyone's minds around here because that as a concept doesn't exist. I'm sorry I don't have any solutions for you except to choose to be with and around people who would do that for you. My friends know and they do understand, I'm also living as me in Gender Studies classes where people are more receptive and accepting, just having people that I can trust to be as myself around is immensely helpful and helps me get through the rest of the times im seen as my agab, or the binary opposite of my agab. Personally, being here on this subreddit also helps, makes me forget about the whole other world just for a bit. The most I can offer you is that you are not alone in this. Maybe try to sit down and really have a long talk with your parents, have them listen to you, and you to them and try to work out why and where they still think of you as your agab, so you can disprove(? idk the word sorry, english is not my first language) them.
We all have our roles in this world to help it evolve. You're is to experience and teach others a new way to live in the world. You are an angel.
I dealt with that for a long time. Parents have a heavily gendered idea of their child. Many parents say stuff to adult children like ""he'll always be my little boy."" I think parents that feel like they are losing this child or have that issue are trying to break down the idea of what they have known for a long time. It took two years of living close to them for them to actually get the point and adjust. It may take time but if they are supportive they will adjust eventually, stay on them about it.

As far as the hrt you have a ton of changes coming. The drastic effects of HRT don't really hit until 2 years of hormones, and then there are years of the changes taking full effect. That may change people's perception, but unfortunately people do tend to sort male or female. I am in the south and everyone here grew up saying ma'am and sir so it is hard to be seen as neither male nor female. You are also part of this revolution though. The more people that ask to not be sorted the more sorting people will become retrograde. Stay strong and find a supportive group of friends~
I stopped to care about how other people see me. My main goal is to feel good with myself without validation from others.

‚ú®Cry myself to sleep‚ú®
Maybe you could ask your parents to practice when you're not around?
Just saying I feel you, no advice or anything, just that I also understand this.
i feel that way too. i've come to terms with that fact that my entire life, i'll have to come out to everyone i meet. it's not like being binary trans where you can pass as your gender (not that it's that easy to be binary trans), everyone will assume i'm either male or female. usually female. idrk how to help, but you're not alone in this
Dude, for my situation, I just...  Fuck them at this point.

For context, I am a AMAB Demiguy (use They and He). But, I didn't even pick up/use the non binary label until a couple years ago, and I've never medically transitioned in anyway. I'm also a rather large guy, I have long hair, I could never grow much facial/body hair and I'm not the most masculine sounding person on the planet. But, I do dress fairly masculine (lots of t-shirts and shorts).

So, as you can imagine, I get called a girl/ma'am/miss... A lot. Mostly by elderly/older people. It has literally happened my entire life. As far back as I can remember. Even insults from my own grandmother that I don't/didn't look enough like a boy.

I just... I'm so fucking over it, man. Nothing I say or do will convince these people otherwise. And I really don't know what to do about it other than just ignore it.

For awhile there, I used to think some pretty angry thoughts in my head. Like, whenever someone would call me a girl, I would think ""I have a fucking dick, you know?! Want me to whip it out and show you?!""

Well, according to my transfem ex, that probably wouldn't have been the best way to handle that situation back then. And now that more I know about trans and non binary people, and the community as a whole, I can see why.

At this point, though, the anger has just turned into acceptance and a bit of sadness. I don't correct people anymore, unless I am going to interact with them for more than 5 minutes. And even then, if they won't accept it, there's not much I can do. It's just not worth my mental health to engage with it anymore. The people who care about my actual gender, care. The people who don't, don't. Sadly, it's as simple as that.

Sorry that this rant isn't more uplifting or inspiring, it's just my own personal story of bullshit. I wish I had a better story to tell though. Sorry.
I‚Äôm so sorry that your relationship with your parents is so rocky because of this. That‚Äôs their choice, not yours, and it *sucks.* Be adults, parents! 

This is what I‚Äôm afraid of too. No matter how much my parents *say* they support me, if they can‚Äôt use my pronouns, they don‚Äôt really support me. And I won‚Äôt be able to be around it because it hurts so much. I‚Äôm afraid our relationship will crumble and they‚Äôll blame me for ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing too sensitive‚Äù and ‚Äúnot being able to just accept our support the way we give it.‚Äù 

Ugh it‚Äôs so tough! I was thinking of writing them a letter about it. The few times that I‚Äôve had to have huge boundary conversations with them it‚Äôs gone very poorly for my mental health, so I‚Äôm thinking if I don‚Äôt actually have to see their reaction it might help.
Thank you for sharing your experiences. I‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôre not able to be who you are in your whole life. I know how much that sucks too. I do think that I need to convey the whole impact of this for them. I don‚Äôt think they know how much it‚Äôs hurting me. I think they get that it‚Äôs not ‚Äúwhat I want‚Äù but I don‚Äôt believe they think it‚Äôs a non-negotiable for me. Which it is. 

I hope you can find more and more ways to live as your own authentic self.
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ you‚Äôre too sweet!
This is so encouraging! I‚Äôm sorry it took your parents to get on board but I‚Äôm glad they did. I hope my parents will get it. 

You‚Äôre so right about the ‚Äúsorting‚Äù too. It‚Äôs sucks because I also don‚Äôt really want to be gendered as a guy either. It‚Äôd be better than woman but it‚Äôs still not right. 

As for T, I‚Äôm on a super low dose and a DHT blocker because I don‚Äôt want bottom growth or facial hair, so the changes won‚Äôt be that noticeable for most people, especially because I‚Äôm fat so I won‚Äôt get visibly muscly unless I lose weight. So I know I won‚Äôt be seen as anything but a woman until I can get top surgery. Once I do, I‚Äôll probably just be misgendered in a slightly more comfortable way lol. 

Just sucks that people don‚Äôt even seeing the in between. Preaching to the choir I know lol.
That‚Äôs a great goal lol. I‚Äôm not likely to get there any time soon.
üò© I‚Äôm sorry! I feel that though.
I guess I thought they were already doing that? But I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôd think that when they literally never use the right pronouns when I‚Äôm *right there.* So, that‚Äôs a great suggestion. Thank you!
Thank you. I hate that other people have to feel this too, but at the same time, it helps to know that I‚Äôm not spiraling over nothing.
Thank you for sharing. I hate that anyone else has to deal with this, but it is good to know this feeling is real.
Yep, but it does get easier. You also build up a tolerance and start to see yourself in way others cant take away, even if it hurts. 

Btw, your weight distribution can still change. I saw an article on micro dosing T and  by 3.5 years in they had fat redistribution. It is more like a dad bod with fat leaving hips and thighs and going to the stomach. Even if you don't lose weight working out can help this, as it helps you burn old fat regenerate androidal fat that matches your new hormones better when you eat. Good luck with everything!
Oh I‚Äôve definitely had some fat redistribution already. I was *very* hourglass shaped and the waist has filled in a bit and moved to the front. Beer gut without the beer lol. And I work out anyway. Wouldn‚Äôt stay sane if I didn‚Äôt lol. So I know my shape will change a bit but I‚Äôm not expecting it to be very noticeable to anyone but me.
That's awesome, I think you will have more changes than you expect, good luck with everything ü´Ä"	10yscfr	NonBinary	41	0.96	2023-02-10 13:44:15
Why I'm taking feminizing hormones even though I'm not a woman	"So I've been on hormones full time for about 5 months now and I felt inspired to share my story of how I got to where I am today. Not because I think it's a special story or anything, but to help myself reflect and also to write down an experience that might possibly be of help to someone here, somehow. The focus is mostly on hormones, but I also discuss the relevant parts of me realizing and accepting my identity as nonbinary as well. TL;DR at the top, text essay follows.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I am not a woman. Nor am I a man. But being on hormones makes me a happier person. That's pretty much all there is to it.

\-2 years ago: AKA La Big Crack-

I'm sitting in an auditorium as someone is giving a talk on gender inclusiveness. He puts up a slide with a definition for the word 'male' (in the most literal sense, no agenda there), and as I stare at this slide it hits me. ""I am not a man."" Something clicks. I'd always been uncomfortable to varying degrees around most other guys and with the general concept of masculinity as I'd seen most men portray it. I actually grew up specifically trying to NOT be like what I saw in a lot of other guys. And so realizing I was not a man was honestly not the biggest shock. It was more of a quiet revelation. ""Aha, that explains a lot."" After coming to accept this newfound realization however, a flood of other questions came. ""Am I woman?"" ""Do I want to be a woman?"" ""If I'm not a man, what am I?"" And really that's what most of my questions boiled down to, and I left that auditorium with one elephant of a question hanging over my head. ""What am I?"" 

I spent the next few days in a state of internal chaos, and honestly mostly searching through as many trans and gender related subreddits as I could to learn as much as I could about other people's experiences and what they'd been through. About a week later, after sponging up as much information as I could handle, I was still pretty lost. All I knew was that I wasn't a man. I didn't know how to feel like what I ""was"" though. I just knew that I wanted to be more feminine. And so I decided that I would proceed under the assumption that I was a trans woman, and if/when I hit a point where I didn't want to be more feminine I could go from there, but I honestly couldn't see where that point would be. After going out with a friend I cried to her while confessing that I thought I was trans, which I had begun to convince myself of at the time. 

Luckily my school was pretty liberal and well-off, and I actually found a program through the gender services department that matched you with a 'mentor' of your preferred gender and/or sexuality (to the best of their ability, as these people were doing this on a volunteer basis). Through this I met a non-binary mentor, and started attending a weekly support group for trans and nonbinary folk. Around the same time I was able to find an absolutely delightful therapist experienced with gender issues, who I met with every two weeks. 

As the year progressed these parties helped me to learn a lot. I came out to a couple of close friends who I knew would be supportive (again, as transgender) and - at the recommendation of my therapist - started experimenting with presentation and pronouns and names in very very closed settings. The more I experimented, the more sure I became that I was trans. I liked wearing women's clothes. I started shaving my legs and \*TMI WARNING\* pubes, and generally liked being called by other names and pronouns, although I felt mixed feelings being called them while presenting as male. Something kept sticking to the back of my mind though. Even though I wasn't a man, I wasn't particularly bothered by people treating me as one (besides the pronouns, because those were definitely wrong). To be honest I'd never really cared about how others perceived me, and as time went on it became more and more apparent that social perception was a nonfactor in how I felt about my identity. 'Passing' was a concept that started to lose its appeal at this point. Sure I would probably be happy if I'd been born with a female body, but ultimately I didn't care to go through the effort of having others perceive me as female so long as I was happy with myself. I have a surprisingly deep and booming voice for someone my size which I love, and I had no intention of going through voice training if I didn't have to. That would definitely throw a wrench in presenting female as well. At some point I thought ""I'm just me."" 

&#x200B;

\-1 year ago: AKA (Prescription) Drugs-

At this point I'm relatively comfortable with where I'm headed. I know that I like female clothing, affirming pronouns, and not having to give a hoot about the way I sit, because I like crossing my legs dammit. Still presenting as male though. I'd been using some old clothes that a friend had been kind enough to let me have, but didn't really have anything of my own besides some leggings I bought at Meijer in a spontaneous moment of societal defiance. And also because they were near the self-checkout. I definitely didn't have the money to do much to my wardrobe though, and wasn't really ready to start making waves with my presentation until I was sure of where I wanted to go with it. In light of this my therapist brought up hormones one day. ""Yeah, that actually sounds like a good idea."" At this point I'm still operating under the assumption that I'm a trans woman, although starting to realize that that's not entirely accurate. But since I was still trying to determine my 'transition' goals I figured it wasn't worth rocking the boat too much right then. Anyways, I definitely knew I wanted my body to be more feminine. Plus from what I'd read about the effects of estrogen on mood and emotions they sounded like things I would benefit from. Thus, I went to an informed consent clinic and got a prescription for estradiol (estrogen) and spiro (an anti-androgen, lowers testosterone but isn't a hormone per say). After just being on spiro for about two weeks to test the waters there hadn't been many changes, but I'd noticed my facial hair growing a little bit slower, slightly softer skin, and was starting to feel some light sensitivity in my nipples. Happy with the other changes but not quite ready to deal with the weight of having breasts (haha, get it?) I had a mild freakout and quit spiro altogether for several months. 

Fast forwarding past those months and I'm ready to give hormones another try. I hadn't been on spiro long enough to notice any significant changes, and I definitely felt like I needed to give estrogen a fair shake before making a final verdict on them. This time I took both estrogen and spiro for a month, and it was only when I actually noticed a slight (but real) amount of breast growth that I stopped, as I still wasn't ready to have anything change that could affect my day-to-day life. However, I learned a lot in that month. I definitely liked all of the physical changes. Slower facial/body hair growth, softer skin, plus the thought of having breasts was actually exciting once I realized it was close to becoming a reality. I'd also definitely had a generally increased mood. It's less like I got more emotional and more like some kind of weight I'd always felt in my head was being lifted off, and I could just breathe easier. It's hard to describe, but it was absolutely liberating. Since middle school there's always been something in my head that's made it easy for me to get depressed and start feeling apathetic. As time went on it had gotten better - mostly because I'd learned how to deal with it - but this was the first time I felt like it was actually leaving me. That was what really did it. This was what made me sure I wanted to continue with hormones full-time at some point, even though I wasn't quite ready then.

As this year progresses I'm still experimenting with things with my friends. At one point I'm with a very close female friend, and she starts talking about doing my makeup and watching Disney movies in a very well meaning and eager-to-help-with-the-female-experience kind of way (this is the person who gave me her old clothes). As she was going on I started to get uncomfortable. ""Is this what being a girl is?"" ""Do I have to start liking these things?"" ""Why can't we just hangout like normal?"" I did take her up on her offer though, as I'd had yet to do something I would consider as 'strongly feminine' as this night sounded like it was going to be. And as I'm sitting there, staring at the mascara and foundation on my face in a mirror I became afraid. Not of looking like a man in makeup, but of simply hating how I looked compared to how I wanted to look. I knew that if I was going to 'be' a woman I was always going to be unhappy with the discrepancy between my actual appearance and my desired presentation. To be happy as a woman I was going to try and reach unrealistic goals and would always be paranoid that something was off. The worst part was knowing that even if I did everything perfectly, even if I could hit all of those unrealistic goals, it might not be enough. I would not be happy as a woman, plain and simple. It was this day I accepted myself entirely. ""I am not a woman."" ""I'm just me.""

&#x200B;

\-Present day: AKA Freedom-

Today I've been on hormones full-time for 5 months. I graduated school and recently met a new endo who doubled my doses, which I've been on for the past month or so. And I am so fucking happy. Because I am not a woman and this treatment is something which is actively improving my life anyways. I'm happier with my body, I feel much more in tune with my emotions and general sense of being, and living is more enjoyable. I laugh and cry so much more than I used to, even if it's sometimes because of silly things (it is not unusual for one to cause the other either). I am on this medication because it's just that. Medicine. It makes me feel better. About myself, and about life. The ONLY time I have missed a dose this whole time is because I had to unexpectedly sleep at a friend's place once. I don't have a reminder set on my phone, and I will admit that sometimes when I'm tired I forget about it until I see it on my nightstand, but I have taken it twice a day every day because I am EXCITED to take it. It does not make me more or less nonbinary, but it does make me more me.

I am still presenting male in public, but I have a job now, and you can bet your sweet ass I have an Amazon shopping list of women's clothes I'm going to start ordering off of. Not because I want to present as a woman, but because I want to present as me. And I like women's clothes. I also like some men's clothes. Personally I do want to aim for something more androgynous, but I don't know exactly what that looks like for me yet. Odds are that hormones will naturally draw me to the more feminine side eventually (I doubt I can hide my boobs forever), but I'm prepared to deal with that when it comes. It's worth it.

After 6 months of growing my hair out, today I got it cut with an LGBT friendly stylist. To be honest I'm still not sure how I feel about it. Don't get me wrong the cut is excellent, but I also really enjoyed it being longer. It's okay though, because I know I'm learning more about what I want. Hormones were a big part of that process. And even though I don't know exactly where I'm going yet, I am so fucking excited to get there."	"Thank you so much for sharing this. It helps me to understand why people might present in some way rather than another. And it reminded me that people can be at different points of their journey. I am cis gendered and I am so thankful that I get the opportunity to read about a unique personal perspective on the non-binary experience. I am a therapist and I am trying to be open and welcoming for all kinds of gender identities. But sometimes it is hard to figure stuff out from a privileged point of view and I catch myself questioning certain non-conforming presentations or I get confused and lose empathy. Your post helped me to correct my narrow view once again. So thanks! Your post will have a direct positive impact on the future therapies of all non-binary folks who come to my practice for healing. I wish you all the best, wherever life may take you!
Thank you for sharing your story. It's reassuring to hear someone try something and learn and grow and try something else all while getting closer to being just *themselves*.
Thank you very much for sharing.
I really appreciate you sharing this. I relate to a lot of your story, and I still have a lot to go in my journey and self acceptance. I hope to get on E soon and presenting in whatever way I'm comfortable with. It's easy to forgo our own true feelings and emotions and instead fixate on the pressures of society. It's easy for me to dress somewhat femme and be myself, but when I think of ""being a woman"" it creates all these expectations for myself that are so unbearable where I am right now. And even if I do feel somewhat like a woman, but nonbinaryness is something I take a lot of comfort in.
Suuuper late to this post but this has been phenomenally helpful for me mostly because you‚Äôve shown me that I can try hormones and then stop if I don‚Äôt like them. 
I‚Äôm in similar position of enby and have so much hesitation over starting something that‚Äôs so permanent and change making. Knowing I can actually try them and stop if I like is amazing! Thank you so much.
Please share your before and after pics, as I also want to do this
Thank you so much! Best of luck with your patients, I'm glad this was able to help!
Yeah, staying true to yourself is definitely something that can be easy to lose sight of, especially in modern society. Glad you got something out of this!
You're welcome!
Yeah, I think there's definitely something to be said for feeling comfortable with your gender in relation to yourself. So cheers to us for finding comfort in our nonbinary-ness!
Hey, I'm so sorry it took me this long to reply to this. Honestly I have a lot of reservations about linking my face to my online presence so I needed some time to think about it. I do want to post a before/after in the future, but not until things have changed some more and I'm pretty much settled into how I think I want to present. This will hopefully be within the year, but in addition to the hormones it'll take piercings, tattoos, wardrobe updates, and figuring out a hairstyle I like before I get there. 

I think it's also worth saying that if you specifically are interested in the changes from hormones rather than my personal ""transition"", I'm doing the same kind of treatment that a transgender woman would, and there are other subreddits  ( r/MtF and r/transtimelines are probably the most relevant ) where the collective experiences are probably more useful than just my own anyways."	dkdecf	NonBinary	32	0.98	2019-10-20 02:06:03
"My family thinks that I'm nonbinary because of ""illness"""	"When I was a teen I was diagnosed with MAIS - Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome, which makes me an intersex person. For the most part of my life I was living as a male, although often people was confused what is my ""real"" gender (I have some feminine features). Few months ago I started to identify as a non binary person - I'm okay with all pronouns. But my family constantly is telling me that it is just a ""sickness"" and if there was a way to treat my condition I would definitely be ""normal"". But I don't really care about my infertility and that MAIS thing, it doesn't change how I feel about myself. I am okay with my body and my genitals, I just don't like being categorised as a man because I was always hearing that I'm not masculine enough, that maybe I'm an eunuch or that I should transition with that femaleish face...

Sorry for the rant and all the mistakes, I'm not a native English speaker."	"Hello I'm PAIS kinda similar to yourself I dress masculine/neutral but I'm much closer physically to the fem side so I get misaged a lot.  Not masculine enough!! That's one of the dumbest things I've heard masculinity shouldn't have to do with your physical appearance if you want to use he/him labels that's totally 100% valid if you prefer other labels that's also completely valid but that's your decision to make no one else's. I knew I was nonbinary before I knew I was Intersex the two are completely unrelated. 

Intersex is definitely not an illness don't let people tell you otherwise! Yeah family can really suck at times but just remember your not the only one I'm sure there's plenty of people on here who can relate intersex or not. I'm glad you haven't change the way you feel about yourself because there's completely no need to.
Thank you for you kind comment. I feel better knowing that there are people that are similar to me and don't see this as an illness.
Your welcome. 

Dude it's ain't no illness! Where did you even get that idea?
From doctors. I remember being treated as a curious case, they even send my blood samples to lab in another country because they didn't know what to do with me. 
And my parents was dragging me from one doctor to another, even to the unconventional one (like Chinese medicine or something). So I was always convinced that I'm ill and there is no cure.
I'm so sorry that happened to you. I had a similar experience when I was in school. Those people are called TURFS they think everyone should look and act the same but not everybody looks the same just look around, the world would be a very different place if everyone looked the same! Someone told me off the other day because I said I didn't want to call myself cis nonbinary, the labels I choose got nothing to do with anybody else! You don't even have to call yourself intersex if you don't want to. Your identity, the terms you call yourself, your way of making sense of your experiences, the Meaning you put into your labels - this is your business, your right, and no one can discredit it! 

They convinced you that's there's no cure for being normal, just think how dumb that actually is. DON'T let your past define you."	10d9suy	NonBinary	33	0.95	2023-01-16 09:00:38
I dislike straight relationship dynamics [rant/discussion/advice?]	"I'm trans masc nonbinary. Pre transition when I was a girl and I dated other girls I thought I was a lesbian for a long time. I later discovered I was also attracted to men but the problem was typically the relationship dynamic. I didn't like the idea that because I was the girl there were X, Y and Z expectations for me and my role in the relationship. 

For example in a lesbian relationship there isn't necessarily an expectation about who's top or who's bottom or who's supposed to take care of the other. You're basically automatically switches unless onw of you state ""yeah im an exclusive top/bottom"" or purposely adapt into a heteronormative esk dynamic. 

When you go into a straight relationship if you're the girl you're automatically the bottom and anything differing from that is either seen extremely kinky or just plain weird. And I'm not just talking sexual context I mean the entire relationship dynamic as in who takes care of who. Even being equal is seen as weird. And that's what I dislike about being in straight relationship. And now that I'm mostly masc presenting and prefer to pass as a guy if I got into a relationship with a girl I'd be expected to be ""the guy"" and all those heteronormative expectations that follows with that. 

And I'm not into that. If I were to date a girl I'd want the sane dynamic as a lesbian could. Except not. Since I'm nonbinary I did play with the idea of ""what if I dated a lesbian girl?"" But that'd make me uncomfortable because I'm not a girl and don't wanna be seen as one. However all these things made me question my gender identity once again. Was i really just a masculine woman who likes women? Or am i a guy? Or just nonbinary?

Obviously like thousands of times before i came to the conclusion that no i am not a woman, nor a man. I'm nonbinary. Always has been. 
I just like the gay relationship dynamic, regardlessif its lesbian or mlm I just like the idea that none of us are inherently expected to be anything other than ourselves. 

The thing that makes it so complicated is, internally I feel about 70% like a guy. However like to dress feminine and act feminine in certain ways, but at the same time masculine. The best way I can describe my gender is I feel like a femboy. And if I dated a girl I'd essentially want it to function like a lesbian relationship but without actually being that. But how tf does one explain that to someone¬ø?

I guess this is a of a rant. Sorry it's gotten so long. Please let me know if any of yall feel like this too. I'm kinda wondering if this is just a me thing or if others actually feel like this too"	"I absolutely feel you! I'm pansexual and nb and i def feel constricted by cishetnormative binary relationship expectations regardless of the gender of the person I'm with  (although it's def abated when I'm with fellow enbies.) I def don't want to be seen as ""the guy"" when I'm dating someone and I honestly just want the relationship to develop around mutual intentionality of care and affirmative communication. I'm glad you took the time to articulate your experience because I definitely relate and I feel a sense of solidarity with you. Hope that venting helped and that you are able to find relationships that empower you :)
Hey I also really relate!

I still spend a lot of time hating myself about being incompatible with straightness, which is so unfortunate because I came out as queer way before being nonbinary. I'm pansexual and also started identifying as omnigay in the last couple years which really helps with the internalized hatred. It recontextualizes that I'm not picky or weird or fetishizing queerness, I'm just gay. All the time. That's the way I am and it's normal for me to want to be in a gay relationship.

One of the things I use to deal with heteronormative expectations is to identify exactly where it's coming from. When I see societal expectations as a nebulous force bearing down on me it's scary and it's crushing. But if it's my partner who has a heteronormative expectation, that's their mistake, that's their fault, and it would be wrong of them to change who I am at my core to fit their preferences. If it's actually me who's got the heteronormative expectation of myself, I can work on keeping that in my head and not letting that limit my behaviour. If it's somebody at work or family or whoever else, that's much easier to deal with practically than the opinions of the millions of people around me.

This was a good post for me to read today and I'm glad you shared <3
You bring up a good point. The expectation and assumption of who does what in a relationship is problematic. It denies both person's input on how the relationship develops. That could be something you bring up in the first few dates. That you don't want to assume anything and want to talk about how things work out, are willing to try different roles to see what feels like it fits so that both people are comfortable and heard and validated
I definitely get you, I feel kinda similar. I realized I am actually non binary while I was in a gay relationahip (and luckily still am), but ignoring my relationship status, I would not want to enter a relationship with someone who would see us as a straight couple. Honestly I find myself resonating with other queer people so much I have troubles even having a casual sexual encounter with a straight person, but that might also be, because I am afraid to get into a situation where my needs are not understood.
I can't exactly relate to any of this as I've never dated before but I think if you wanted to explain that to somebody you could try saying that you don't want gender roles or something like that. Idk, just trying to help, take my advice with maybe more than just a grain of salt.
How I might say it.  You want an egalitarian relationship where how the relationship between you functions can't be assumed from cisnormative or heteronormative expectations rooted in either party's gender identity or expression. Instead, expectations, roles, responsibilities etc. should all be regularly discussed so that each of you has your needs and desires fulfilled.

Dating other enby folks after coming out has been pretty wonderful tbh."	x5qurh	NonBinary	30	0.98	2022-09-04 16:17:13
Does anybody else feel like no one wants to listen to/talk about their progress?	"I‚Äôm not out to everyone in my life but every time I bring up new developments/possibilities about my journey I feel like nobody close to me wants to engage about it at all and I feel like a gross bother.

I‚Äôm genuinely excited that I just made my first appointment with an endocrinologist and want to celebrate and shout it from a rooftop but those around me have barely acknowledged it when I‚Äôve told them.

These kind of feelings have been common for me with coming out but it sucks that I don‚Äôt have a hype man/someone that really cares about my transition.

In saying that, you guys are fucking incredible and I gotta say we all deserve awards for gassing people the fuck up!"	"Yay for your endo appointment!
I actually feel like I have the exact opposite problem. Everyone around me supports me, which is great. But there's this attitude of blind affirmation which seems to ignore how I feel about things. For example, the other day a friend put me in touch with an enby hairdresser who could give me a woman's haircut on my limited budget, which was great. But then she spent days hyping up how great it would make me feel, and after I got it, she wouldn't stop talking about how nice it had turned out. And I really appreciate that people do that stuff for me. But the thing is, the haircut didn't make me feel great, and I didn't like how I looked when it was done. I think it was an improvement. I'm very glad that I did it. But for me, it was just basic maintenance to keep me doing ... okay. There's so much pressure to *love yourself*, and the answer to not loving yourself seems always to be the unconditional affirmation of others, that the fact that I fundamentally don't like my appearance feels like something shameful that I need to hide. So it's especially painful when I need to play along with the idea that getting this new haircut makes me really happy, even when it really doesn't, because faking happiness just draws my attention to the underlying things which I'm unhappy about. The irony is that I've dealt with transphobia and homophobia firsthand, and yet some of my worst feelings of dysphoria have come about from experiences of affirmation from other queer people. I don't want to come across as someone who is wallowing in despair, because in actuality I'm far from that. But I wish that people could give me more space to be unhappy.
Ya. I'm often super excited about changes, or frustrated with other changes, or fascinated by all the unexpected things in transition, but it feels like there's no one to talk to about it.

Most cis people either aren't interested, or I find they seem super uncomfortable talking about anything trans related in fear of saying something offensive. It's nice people are trying hard to not offend trans people, but it also feels isolating when people seem uneasy talking to you because you're trans.

With other trans people, I worry I'll trigger their dysphoria by talking about certain things. I've also had a much easier   
 experience than most, and it feels like rubbing salt in the wound talking about certain developments.

Yes, I fully see the irony in complaining that cis people are scared to talk about transition with trans people, then saying I'm scared to talk about transition with trans people. I don't know what can be done about it.

OP if you want to talk to me about all the exciting developments I'd be happy to hear it!
Congratulations on having your first endo appointment ! ‚ô•

which bathroom to use?	"AMAB non-binary here. I'm at a point in my transition where I'm still very much male -passing, but aim to be completely androgynous someday. My question is what bathroom to use in the meantime? I mainly use the men's room because I look like a dude and I don't want to seem like a creep in the women's room. However, I feel a lot more comfortable in the woman's room. I don't want to bother anyone, but I also am guessing most women don't care. What should I do?
Thanks!"	"go where theres the least possible risk of being assaulted. prioritize safety.
I have the opposite. I fear the risk of being assaulted for being Enby, because red states and also just people not realising that Enbys don't NEED to be androgynous.   
Side tangent: >!I hate that modern shows and media keep portraying the majority Nonbinary representation as ""what are you"" or ""neither male or female"" in appearance. Some, like myself, do not have the safety or even the financial capabilities to do so. So, it will eternally aggravate me that Enbys can't be themselves. All because society now believes that we MUST look Nonbinary to be, nonbinary. !<

But yeah. Prioritise safety above all. Hailing from a red state myself (AMAB, NB), you need to absolutely be safe and ensure you aren't attacked before comfort or euphoria. Even I learned this recently. 

Stay safe, a fellow Enby passerby! <3
Agree with the other comments all saying safety first.

If a tie for safety, then going for better comfort as tie breaker makes sense.
I suggest using the women's. You're right that most don't care. People are there to do what they came to do and get out. I dunno where you live but my experience where I live in Canada is any security or staff see it as more of a bother if anyone brings it up to them. All they care about is that people are safe and, in those instances, the people complaining are the ones making others unsafe.
I guess it depends where you are.  Is there more risk of a Karen calling the cops or of being attacked by a drunk?
I would say go in the one you‚Äôre less likely to get hatecrimed in. Fuck this fucked up world
Considering the factors you've mentioned and the fact that you're in the US in a red state I'd say stick to the men's for your own safety.
agree
That's a good point. I do live in a red state in the US though, so I'm slightly more worried about people caring and complaining
Totally valid and ultimately your safety matters more.
I‚Äôm AFAB and present very androgynous.. I use the women‚Äôs room and get looks, questioned and made uncomfortable quite regularly. I live in NE. I think for the most part, women that enter the bathroom just get worried that they themselves have entered the wrong bathroom, but occasionally I run into someone who takes it a step further and confronts me. I‚Äôve learned to live with it, as I feel very uncomfortable going into the men‚Äôs room. If I am very worried based on where I am, I.e more rural areas, I will try to find a single/all people restroom or bring a ‚Äúpassing‚Äù cis-woman as a sorta shield.

Cycling between feeling cis, non-binary and generally confused	"Apologies for this long confusing mess of ideas, but maybe some of you lovely folks can relate?

I‚Äôm AFAB and have been wrestling with my gender identity over the past few months. I seem to be cycling through this process of obsessing over my gender confusion and trying to find a label that feels right, become more confused and frustrated because nothing seems to exactly fit, decide to screw all the labels and just live my life, eventually become curious about or question my gender again, and repeat. It feels like I‚Äôm spinning my wheels and going nowhere. It‚Äôs exhausting. 

While I find that many non-binary people‚Äôs experiences (particularly agender/genderfluid), resonate with me, I don‚Äôt really experience dysphoria aside from mild social discomfort in certain situations ‚Äì most often when I feel I am being treated or viewed differently because I‚Äôm perceived as a woman. 

Generally, I attribute this to disliking performing typical gender roles and patriarchy and all that fun stuff, but on the other hand I sometimes find myself admiring certain male physical characteristics and fantasizing about having a flatter chest or a more masculine build/physique. I‚Äôm also attracted to men/masculinity, so this can be confusing as the distinction between attraction and admiration can feel pretty murky. I actually have similar admiration vs attraction confusion towards women too, and have started exploring the idea that I may be bi. 

Aside from the above, what leads me to suspect that I could be non-binary are:

* feelings of being disconnected and apathetic towards gender or identifying with man/woman
* Love for androgyny and gender non-conformity. I dress somewhat androgynously as I don‚Äôt shave, wear makeup, have a short haircut, and prefer loose-fitting clothing that doesn‚Äôt emphasize my chest and hips.
* Tendency to forget that others see me as a woman and sometimes feeling genderless/gender neutral
* Feel best when I can express myself and dress without feeling like I‚Äôm trying to present as masculine or feminine

At the same time, I don‚Äôt think I fit non-binary/trans narratives as I don‚Äôt want to change my body (I don‚Äôt even have an interest in getting a binder, wearing a sports bra feels good for me), I don‚Äôt want to change my name, and I‚Äôm cool with any pronouns. I‚Äôm also not entirely disconnected from being a woman/female as I‚Äôve lived my whole life as one, which has undoubtedly shaped my perspective and experiences. 

This leads to me believe that I‚Äôm most likely a cis woman that digs gender non-conformity and overthinks too much. I‚Äôm wary as well not to adopt marginalized identities that I don‚Äôt wholeheartedly feel that I belong to considering that I don‚Äôt share the same struggles with transition and dysphoria.

I suppose I‚Äôd feel alright describing myself as agender and/or non-binary, but not transgender. Although being transgender isn‚Äôt a requirement to identify as agender/non-binary, it appears that most people who do also consider themselves to be transgender. It seems that most people assume you are transgender if you identify as a non-binary person as well. I think that I‚Äôll end up just confusing and upsetting people by claiming to be non-binary but not trans. 

I‚Äôm not even sure how much I care much about being seen as non-binary by others. I honestly wonder if my desire to identify as a non-binary or queer person is more about justifying a sense of otherness that I‚Äôve felt since forever, rather than because I truly identify with those labels. All I know is that I keep obsessing and feeling anxious over it. I just want to feel at peace with myself.

I hope at least some of this made sense and if you can relate at all, I would love to hear about it!"	"Yo. Just thought Ild hyu with some of my experience in hopes of making for feel more comfortable/ normal/ not alone.
Im amab, with a beard, no interest at all in changing my body permanently, not even ht, and could not really give a flying toss about pronouns. 
Similar boat again in mostly being attracted to female persons, but again, is this attraction, admiration, both? Who tf knows. Maybe a healthy relationship should involve both? Maybe its envy.
A person I know/ kinda a friend is in the same boat. No real interest in physical changes. Just behavioural. 

Non-binary is a very catch-all term, and I actually think enbys like us are kinda quite rare, as we are happy enough in how we are born, we just feel kinda different to how we perceive others feel about themselves. Like most people who feel how we feel might just stick to being cis-gendered. 

But, end of the day, I regularly fall asleep questioning my gender identity, and what comes with it, and that doesnt seem like a very cisgendered thing to do...

I think you a very welcome here. 
Hey! I can kind of relate but not 100% as I do experience a high amount of social dysphoria but I do feel you on maybe a sense of needing to justify my identity at times? 

A term that I've given some friends is ""cis by convenience"" for if questioned, they'd probably go with their assigned gender just because it's not that big a deal for them and it's easier to function societally but they don't really care about gender in reference to themself. I don't know if that feels like it fits for you at all.

But also, you don't have to experience dysphoria to be nonbinary or trans! If you feel like you like the label, just go for it. You don't have to come out right away to everyone and everything even but just maybe test out if you like the label for yourself - hold it in your head and reference yourself that way and see if it feels enjoyable in any capacity? Not all struggles under an identity are equal and that's okay!
Hey, I feel you with the uncomfortableness around gender roles. It‚Äôs possibly the thing I feel most strongly about, which makes me think this is just some sort of weird feminism thing in my brain? I don‚Äôt really understand and am trying to work out whether this is to do with my gender or with the genders around me in society
I feel you on nearly all of this. Literally, each one of your bullet points is me. I'm at a place now where I have accepted that since these thoughts have been on such a loop in my head, I am operating outside of the binary in some way. I have a feeling that if I really were cis, I would not be thinking about my gender identity so much in the first place.

In sexual orientation circles, they have a saying that attraction does not equal behavior. I would say the same concept applies to gender. Some people do wish to embody their gender identity through physical, external changes and some do not. Gender identity does not equal presentation.

Do not worry or obsess about aligning with a ""dominant narrative."" If the core tenet resonates with you, that is enough. Nonbinary means not aligning with strictly one side of the gender binary/spectrum. Agender means not identifying with any gender. The meaning lies in the label and its ability to resonate with others, not the extent to which your narrative aligns with other people's. If you go down that route of comparison you are sure to end up frustrated since no two experiences are the same. Each person has their own unique relationship to their identity. 

Hopefully what could leave you with less exhaustion is the idea that you have the right to explore. If it turns out that you are cis, that is okay. Trans people will not come after you or hold grudges. If you are nonbinary, that's okay too. 
Can relate a whole lot to it all.

>I honestly wonder if my desire to identify as a non-binary or queer person is more about justifying a sense of otherness that I‚Äôve felt since forever, rather than because I truly identify with those labels.

How do you know that otherness isn't because you have the potential to fit some other role(s) better than the scant and draconian options within the binarist patriarchy?
Hi, as others have said, you don‚Äôt have to have dysphoria to be trans or nb. Also, personally, I did not think I had much dysphoria until I started T and discovered that much of my social anxiety and my eating problems were actually dysphoria! Which isn‚Äôt to say that is necessarily the case for you, but also, it could be. Just because you haven‚Äôt had dysphoria as someone else describes it doesn‚Äôt mean you haven‚Äôt had it, or that you‚Äôre not nb. 
I think there‚Äôs a lot of barriers to exploring one‚Äôs gender identity: the concept that nb only means androgynous or rebelling against your agab, the dysphoria olympics where you have to be miserable to be valid, the binary in general, body policing, what ‚Äúvalid‚Äù looks and sounds like, and other spooky things. 

Dysphoria can come and go. You don‚Äôt need dysphoria 24/7 to be valid. People who suffer from their dysphoria have my upmost empathy and love, but it isn‚Äôt a requirement. 

You don‚Äôt have to change anything about you‚Äôre self to be non-binary, unless you want to. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúright‚Äù way to be non-binary. Go explore! So cool things in your own best interest! Experiment all you want! Just do what makes your comfortable and makes you feel authentic. 
This is such a great question. I'm just starting to experiment with presenting more masculine (I'm 5'5 and 115 pounds so it's a work in progress). I feel like I'm judging myself for ""jumping on the bandwagon"" with so many people being more open about their nb status. 

Like you I keep querying myself like, ""Why do I have to think about this?""

So I decided to list things that make me think about being nonbinary like you did!

* Experiencing discomfort when others make sexist statements towards me or treat me differently because I look like a woman
   * Men have propositioned me at work
   * I feel like I don't get taken seriously when I'm giving my opinion
   * Other people talk over me
   * I GET TOLD TO SMILE MORE I FUCKING HATE IT
* Feeling that the only way I can define gender is by how other people treat me (see above).
* I put in a packer yesterday that I made from a sock. It felt so cool to see myself in a different way. I made a bigger one with 3 socks for today :D
* I love wearing makeup, so today I did some contouring and stuff to make my face look more masculine. I love how I look. I have acne and I feel it makes me look more masculine anyway, so I'm using it to enhance my appearance instead of hiding it.
* I've always wanted to dress up in male costumes for Halloween since I was in kindergarten and my mom wouldn't let me go to school in my Alladin costume with no shirt under the vest. Dressing up sexy for Halloween feels like a very forced performance.
* Edit: I stopped shaving my armpits and it feels so right to have body hair.
* I have been in serious long term relationships with men over the past few years and came out as queer (in a sexuality way) about 2 years ago, but haven't dated non-cis men yet. The one exception is a nb person named Charlie who I think is so cute and has the perfect androgynous fashion style. I also had these feelings when I dated them but ignored the feelings once I got into a hetero relationship.

What do you think? Does this resonate with anyone else? Sorry for the long post, you just put all my thoughts into words really well!!
I can't really relate to this because I'm a Very Dysphoric NB ‚Ñ¢, but I just wanna say being non binary isn't a contest about who has the most dysphoria and that whatever your decision, you're welcome here üòä
I also got lucky with birthnames, in that the shortened form is already gender neutral enough for me.
So if I was to ever change me name legally, which would only be if I could correct gender, which I legally cant atm (only with surgery in my backwards country), it would be to my shortened/ nickname that everyone already calls me anyway. 
This is awesome and has been very comforting to read and know that I'm not alone in having these thoughts. Thank you so much for sharing your experiences. Agreed that aside from bouts of envy/attraction to some male physical features I'm more interested in behavioural changes. Now that I think about it, I have already been adopting a mix of non-verbal behaviours for awhile and have recently been incorporating more neutral language into my speech. Perhaps I should keep exploring this further and see how that feels.  


I have definitely read about similar experiences to me from people who still identify as cis. It could very well be that they are unaware of how broad of a term non-binary is (I know I was when I first heard of it), and thus continue to identify as cis-gender. Then again, you make a good point that most probably don't regularly question their gender identity.  


Regardless, I really appreciate your insight - it's given me a lot to think about!
Cis by convenience. I love this. I'm using this lol.

Never met another enby who did this too, so that's incredibly validating. 
Yes! It's like I feel the need to justify my identity, but feel insecure in my ability to articulate fuzzy experiences and emotions in a coherent or legit sounding way. So I shy away from embracing any labels because I can't point to anything concrete that would prove that my experiences could be different than other cis-gender people who don't feel strongly attached to their gender.

I totally jive with cis by convenience. Although I've noticed that I often feel a bit weird when I have to specify my gender as woman/female either on a form or in social interactions. I rarely describe myself or my experiences in connection to gender, so it can be jarring to have to suddenly call attention to it.

Testing the waters with identifying as non-binary/agender/something privately for a bit sounds like a great idea. Thank you for your kind thoughts :)
Yeah this is a tough one to tease out. I had this exact issue in relation to body image issues when I was younger. I really disliked anything that appeared to be too feminine or soft. Eventually, I realized that my discomfort with having a feminine body was because I had internalized the idea that feminine = weak/inferior and didn't want to be seen as that. In my case learning more about feminism, getting to know and appreciate all different kinds and shapes of awesome women and taking care of my body helped immensely in alleviating my unease. I'm pretty content with my body now, so at least in that area I don't think what I was experiencing then was gender dysphoria.  


Sorting out gender roles has been a lot harder though. I'm doubtful that we can even completely separate our internal sense of gender from the influence of societal gender roles as they tend to be deeply embedded in culture and thus can shape our perceptions in not so easily identifiable ways. It could be both an issue with your gender and societal expectations of gender maybe?
Thank you! This has been very helpful, especially what you mentioned about identity not equaling presentation. I think a lot of my reservations around identifying outside of the gender binary stem from a fear of being seen as delusional or attention-seeking or de-legitimizing the identities of other non-binary people because outwardly I'm quite cis-passing. You're absolutely right about not comparing my experiences of gender with others too much. I need to keep remind myself to focus on what resonates versus comparison more often.
Good point! I don't. It's equally possible at this point that this sense of otherness is either connected to not fitting neatly into a gender binary or is some new weird flavour of anxiety that I'm dealing with. Or maybe it's both? Who knows, but I shouldn't rule out the possibility of this being connected to gender just yet.
Oh that is really interesting. Do you mind if I ask what motivated you to start taking T if you didn't feel very dysphoric?
Thank you! I really appreciate your kind words and support :)
I had a several year long fascination with T. Like just wondering how I would look and feel on it. And I met some nb people who were really upfront about how (as long as you know the risks) you can start T, and if you don‚Äôt like it you can stop. It‚Äôs not a commitment to doing it forever.

Coming out	"Hi all. Don‚Äôt know if this is any help to anyone or whether anyone has any advice‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm in my early 50s and in the process of coming out as non-binary, including at work. I‚Äôm a teacher in a Special School.  It‚Äôs a great school to work at - friends and colleagues have been superbly supportive so far but I‚Äôve been rather careful who I‚Äôve come out to so far. At staff Christmas do, I was in full makeup but was still quite masculine in my clothing. Normally I wear a shirt to work as I‚Äôve always presented as male (but hated it). I am hoping Santa brings me some new outfits I can wear to work. 

I‚Äôm also trying out a new name for size. I‚Äôve always hated my name as much as I‚Äôve hated other ways I‚Äôve looked male. 

I feel really liberated being out to selected friends and family and want to come completely out.  But that was the easy bit. I‚Äôve masked my identity and sexuality for so long now with the majority of my family that I‚Äôm feeling torn between telling them (and facing possible rejection and/or ridicule) and continuing to live a lie (which has resulted in lifelong chronic depression). I know there are family members who won‚Äôt even want to understand but I can‚Äôt keep living like this - especially as I‚Äôve tasted freedom. 

So, the next few months are my transition period:
‚Ä¢ having a new name either unofficially or legally changing it
‚Ä¢ externalising my gender (or lack of)
‚Ä¢ working out how to explain it to my class at school

If I have huge honkers and ass am I still valid??	I've been contemplating this for a while and I want to transition with a big ass and boobs, something that I've always wanted and always have dysphoria over whenever I realize how flat I am as an amab. I normally see other nonbinary's on the platform talk about being as ambiguous as possible to leave people guessing or the cultured one to know that your androgynous and I'm just here, like am I valid if I want huge assets and don't care if people assume I'm a female.	"you're absolutely valid. everyone has different goals
So long as you know you're non-binary, there's no wrong way to look or transition as a non-binary person. It's your body, do whatever makes you happy. Non-binary =/= androgynous :)
The way you look will never change who you are!!! If thats what you want then GO FOR ITTTT! I bet you'll look stunning!
You don't owe cis people your androginity. Of course you'd be valid. Gender expression is completely different to gender. ""Assets"" as you call them, are a part of gender expression in my opinion. You do you. Also each person's gender on here is pretty different and unique. Yours might be on the feminine side (or not). Still valid. Still non-binary. You don't have to be strictly agender or bigender to be non-binary."	jm8kk6	NonBinary	21	0.93	2020-11-01 19:43:29
Partner making assumptions about the gender binary	"Hi, I've been lurking here a while and now I'm looking for advice. I've been identifying as non-binary/genderqueer for about a year, and recently my partner and I have been having a lot of conversations about gender identity. She's a bit older than me and grew up in a very conservative culture with no education about gender stuff. So we're running into some communication difficulties!

The reason I'm posting now is that we just had an argument about biological sex, with her basically insisting on the supremacy of a biological gender binary. It started with her trying to find out my therapist's sex, to which I said I wasn't actually sure how they identify but they use they/them pronouns and present pretty androgynously. And she said I got really defensive and was deliberately being difficult because I ""must be able to tell"" from a video call. I asked why it mattered, and it was something about trying to figure out if they were the same person someone else was talking about. I said without knowing the person's name or any other details that was pointless anyway! 

I tried to point out that ""biological sex"" is actually a lot more complex than people realise, and she said ""well if you witness a crime or something you aren't going to be looking at chromosomes, you just have to tell the police if the person you saw was a man or woman. You have boobs, people are going to see you as a woman."" Putting aside the fact that police profiling isn't the model of behaviour I aspire to, I found this really personally hurtful because being reduced to my physical appearance and assigned sex at birth is exactly what I'm struggling against. She keeps saying she doesn't care how I identify or what pronouns I use, but she's made it clear that she doesn't want me to physically transition at all. Which I don't want to do anyway, but I hate feeling like my gender identity is only acceptable to her because I'm still 'physically' female.

But personal stuff aside, I'm hoping for some advice about how to explain how rude it is to assume you can guess someone's 'real' sex, to someone who sees the reality of the world as everyone having one of two sexes. I've been doing a lot of googling and have found some good articles explaining the complexities of biological sex, but I'm worried she's going to dismiss them with ""but that's not the way the world actually works"". And I know society is based around an assumed gender binary, I have in fact existed in the world for multiple decades! So how do I explain that it's still rude and reductive to think of people that way?

Tl;dr... How do I explain what's wrong with the gender binary so that someone I love who is very gender essentialist will get it? Thanks in advance!!"	"my advice would be to break up with her. this isn‚Äôt a communication difficulty, she‚Äôs being deliberately ignorant and disrespectful. a year is more than enough time to accept something new about someone you allegedly love.

if you really want to stay with her though, give her an ultimatum. either she puts in the work to be a better partner and unlearn her transphobic biases, or you will leave. if she really cares about you, she will try. and if she complains or says that‚Äôs unfair or tries to tell you that you‚Äôre overreacting (both of which would be bullshit), tell her congratulations, because it is no longer her problem and the relationship is over.

she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt care‚Äù how you identify but doesn‚Äôt want you to physically transition? that paired with what else you said is abusive, controlling behavior. she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt care‚Äù in the sense that she doesn‚Äôt respect you, not in the sense that it doesn‚Äôt bother her.

you deserve someone who will love you for who you are, not who they want you to be. you may love her, but if she loved you, she would be at least willing to try. if she isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs time to move on for your own sake.
On the topic of sex not being a simple male vs female:

- [Great summary of the basics in easy to understand language](https://cadehildreth.com/gender-spectrum/)
- [Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/beyond-xx-and-xy-the-extraordinary-complexity-of-sex-determination/) has a cool infographic in their article.
- [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/opinion/sex-biology-binary.html) guest article from a professor of biology on the complexity of sex.
- [Paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2470289718803639) on the topic, including the quote ""The view that the world‚Äôs population can be separated into a clearly defined dyadic unit of male and female is defunct; not only clinical observations, but molecular biology has established that sexual identity is on a continuum, with an enormous potential for variance"".
Probably not what you want to hear, but‚Ä¶ the chance that she‚Äôll change her mind is slim, whatever you come up with. If she wants to be a binary gender essentialist (and it sounds as if she does), she‚Äôs not going to budge. Sometimes it‚Äôs not about culture, but about whether or not a person has the willingness to listen and to try to understand before dismissing something. Does it seem like she tries to process your explanations at all?

If your current efforts have no effect, I would advice you to stop trying to convince her with reason and arguments and see if time with you can start eroding that conviction (if it feels worth it to you). Keep shutting down attempts to find out people‚Äôs ‚Äùreal gender‚Äù, but in a non-conflict way if possible, so that it becomes boring rather than a point of contention. Conflict can make people dig in their heels even though they may be open to changing their minds if not having to defend their starting position.

If time goes on and she can‚Äôt accept that whatever your body looks like, you‚Äôre not a woman, and whatever other peoples‚Äô bodies look like that does not mean one can tell their gender or even their agab, the relationship may be of limited viability longterm. It makes a huge difference to be in a realationship with someone who actually knows and appreciates your real gender/s (or lack thereof), and it can be a particularly eroding type of loneliness to be in a longterm relationship with someone who does not accept or believe you.

You can and probably should explain how these conversations evoke scary feelings for you and worries about her acceptance of you. 

Bringing people evidence only works in narrow margins of viewpoint where someone is genuinely ready to accept new information and change their stance based on it. When we have these hot button and worldview sort of topics, we can only do so much rational advocating for ourselves without some kind of emotional check in as well. It takes a long time for people to change their mind when they‚Äôre determined they‚Äôre right. Take care of yourself. You and she can sit in two different places with your personal understanding of the world IF you‚Äôre both being respected and cherished and made to feel wholly loved.

These are scary conversations. My wife doesn‚Äôt have quite the same worldview as your partner but she has commented before about how the world will see me, how the world does see me, and other things that I think binary people (or even sometimes just people who don‚Äôt relate to the concept of gender, for whom it begins and ends at sex because that‚Äôs all they have experience of) just take for granted. Her dysphoria and my dysphoria are very different, and so are our coping strategies. Even though we‚Äôre both trans, we‚Äôre fully capable of saying hurtful things that shake our confidence in how we‚Äôre accepted by each other. It‚Äôs not worth trying to intellectually win an argument when you‚Äôre feeling like there‚Äôs a knife in your chest. Address the knife and the force that pushed it into you. Assert your needs and boundaries. Worry about facts later and gradually over time.
I would not waste my time. I'd think seriously about your partner's inability to do research on their own to educate themselves about your gender identity and whether whatever else they offer you can make up for their casual indifference to your gender identity, the fact that you are still figuring out elements for yourself, and that you do not subscribe to a plainly erroneous idea of a harsh binary.
Thanks so much for commenting. You've given me a lot to think about, and a better sense of what boundaries I need to set. I'm not ready to give up on the relationship, but I will absolutely tell her that she needs to do better. It's really validating to hear that I'm not being the unreasonable one here so thank you!!
Thank you so much, those look like great resources! I will definitely pass them on üòä
Thanks so much for your reply! That's a really good point about conflict making people more entrenched in their beliefs. I'm going to see if more time and communication makes a difference, but I'm going to keep in mind that things might not work long term.
Yeah, me too
Thanks, that's a really useful perspective to hear. It's definitely an emotional issue for me and not something I can just rationally explain. You've definitely helped me reframe the conversation as being about my needs rather than the actual issue of sex vs gender. And now time will tell!
Thanks, I appreciate the advice. Apart from this the relationship is great so I'm not ready to give up on it, but it's absolutely worth keeping all this in mind!"	tfuoi4	NonBinary	21	1.0	2022-03-16 22:15:39
Trans Guy doesn't think non-binary people belong in the trans community	"Hello everyone, I'm non-binary and just found this sub through One Topic At A Time.

So, a few days ago I was saying in one of my Discord Servers that non-binary people are trans, which by definition they/we literally are, and my trans guy friend said that non-binary people don't belong in the trans community. His arguments were that we don't belong in there bc ''we don't go through the same stuff he does'' and ''we don't have gender dysphoria''. Which is, as you probably know, wrong on every level. Like, I'm not comfortable with people calling me ''she'' or ''girl'' (I'm afab btw) or when people deadname me bc I'm not comfortable with the gender I was asigned with at birth, just like him. But instead of transitioning to a binary gender, which would be male in my case, I feel happy with being non-binary. And that would still make me trans, bc I'm simply not cis-gender. And I'm also not only socially transitioning bc I'm also planning on getting top-surgery bc just like him, I feel uncomfortable with my chest. Bc I have gender dysphoria, **just like him.** Like, I mean, I don't have a problem with my bottom, but still.

So, he and me go through similar stuff but I don't get why he thinks non-binary people don't belong in the trans community when it's literally in the definition of trans. Also, not every binary-trans person goes through the same stuff as him but they are still trans.

I just don't know. What do you guys think?

**EDIT**: I forgot to add that he also said that people who just don't care about which pronouns you use with them hurt the trans community and I'm just like ??????

&#x200B;

PS: If you find any typos or gramatical errors, you can keep them"	"‚ÄúTruscum‚Äù or ‚Äútransmedicalism‚Äù are gatekeeping perspectives from the trans side ‚Äî truscum either gatekeep all nonbinary folks, or only those without dysphoria, and transmedicalists gatekeep people who don‚Äôt medically transition to some arbitrary level that matches their personal definitions. 

That said though, not all nonbinary people experience dysphoria, and not all nonbinary people choose the ‚Äútrans‚Äù label (some choose the ‚Äúcis‚Äù label, and some feel neither trans nor cis and wish there were a choice that was not binary ü§î). Nonbinary is definitely within the trans umbrella though, and in fact the white stripe in the trans flag is for us. Your friend is just plain wrong. Have you tried asking him why he feels that way? Or telling him how it makes you feel when he says things like that? Or do you have other friends who can push back against his saying those things so it‚Äôs not only you? You shouldn‚Äôt *have* to do these things, and if you wanted to friends-breakup with him I wouldn‚Äôt blame you, just throwing some ideas out there if you want to stay friends and try to change his mind.
truscum are unfortunately common, but fortunately, wrong. it's just transphobia in a new package
He sounds uneducated and insecure, based on your description. Defining whether someone is trans based on whether they meet a certain threshold of dysphoria is... kind of twisted. We're defined by our gender, not our discomfort. And since words like transgender or non-binary are just ways for us to communicate our experiences to others, *we* get to choose what words we feel best describe those experiences.
Welcome to the group. Also fuck that guy. He is a fool, hateful, and probably has sawed off peckerwood.
Welcome to the sub. Your friend is so wrong and you are so right. I'm non binary agenderfluid. Personally I don't want to admit to being transgender but I am. I also suffer from dysphoria. Yes I don't go through the same stuff that he does, everyone's journey is different. In comparison I think he has it easy. He should try wakening up in the morning feeling female, by lunchtime you feel male and by evening you feel female again. And at other times you can be anything in between. In simple terms it is s\*\*t. 

Remind him that everyone is valid.
I feel like you outlined a lot of the points. Non-binary people go through most if not all of the same things binary trans people do. And while the idea of of ‚Äúpassing‚Äù is something we should be focusing on less and isn‚Äôt the end all be all, but I struggle with the fact that there really isn‚Äôt any way to ‚Äúpass‚Äù as non-binary. Like a lot of us will always be visibly trans and have to always assert our pronouns. 

It‚Äôs stuff like this that made me super afraid to identify as trans, but like I‚Äôm not cis and I face a lot of the oppression like getting harassed in public for things so like... how is my fate not tied to that of the trans community? Why then should I not be part of it?
It almost sounds like he's still not comfortable with his gender even after transitioning if he has to work this hard to define who he is (by excluding everyone else who isn't +exactly him+).

I know you feel this person is your close friend, but ask yourself... if you said that his identity wasn't valid, that he was a girl because he assigned as one at birth, would you be acting like a friend worth keeping? No. Neither is he.
He is one of my close friends, so I'm trying to stay friends.
And yeah, every single person in our discord server told him, that he is really wrong. I told him that saying stuff like that gave me a panic attack. He also told me that he feels like ""it's like people invade is community"" just bc they don't go through the same amount of suffering as him.
I know that he is in fact pretty insecure which I can understand to some point. But if you're so insecure that you exclude people from a community that they belong in, it's just not fair.
I wouldn't say fuck him bc he is still one of my close friends but it made me still really mad and this will forever stay in the back of my head.
Yeah so suffering is how he defines being trans? That‚Äôs a really cruel way of doing it. Plus it puts people‚Äôs identities in the hands of their abusers. Does that mean if a trans person had a completely accepting family, school, and community, that they wouldn‚Äôt be trans?
He honestly sounds very insecure about his identity. When people feel abnormal or like freaks in the eyes of society, they often try really hard to distinguish themselves as 'less freakish than all the other freaks'. They alienate people who they (or society) perceive as 'less normal' because they think it will validate them in the eyes of society as normal in comparison. This is the crux of respectability politics. That we as the oppressed have control over our oppression, that the reason we are treated poorly is because we don't meet some arbitrary standard of normalcy. So as long as we try hard enough to do meet that standard, then cis people will accept us with open arms. And people who don't do that or jeopardize our chances of being able to do this by being too abnormal, ridiculous and unbelievable, need to be alienated and shunned by the community. Because they make the community 'look bad'. It's bullshit logic and based on the false idea that if you sing and dance for cis people the way they want you to, if you adjust to their expectations of what is considered 'normal', then maybe they'll respect you. News flash - they won't, and the way we get them to do that is NOT by alienating others. Cis gay people did this to trans people in the past ('trans people are too freakish and weird and jeopardize our chances of getting rights, let's kick them out') and now some binary trans people do this to nonbinary people. 

Suffering and insecurity is never an excuse to treat people badly. It might help to challenge his logic by asking him whether he thinks his experience of being trans is the only one that matters, whether he thinks binary trans people who don't go through the same things he does are suddenly not trans. What authority he has to decide this. How he would feel if someone with more dysphoria than him did to him what he is doing to nonbinary people. Why he thinks being trans has to be centred around suffering. Or even what respectability politics are and how he's playing into that (and how he's literally being exactly like cis gay people who in the past and even presently think all trans people shouldn't be part of the community in the exact same way he thinks nonbinary people shouldn't be in the community). Fundamentally though you can give him time to change his views, you can discuss it with him, you can tell him how he's hurting you and others, but you can't force him to change. If he doesn't budge then you might have to reconsider your friendship. It's not worth it being friends with someone who doesn't understand how hurtful and toxic they are being, and isn't interested in understanding and changing.
... so why are you ‚Äòfriends‚Äô with this dickwad again?
Definitely not saying it's fair.
I admit the fuck him part is a bit too far, but honestly I tend to be a bit extra sometimes. Honestly though this is the kind of hate that the LGBT+ community doesn't need. He is basically trying to make an argument like a TERF would make. He is a Non-binary Exclusionary Radical Trans-person. Though I don't think ""NERT"" will catch on.
Yeah, that is pretty dumb. 
Like, I personally never really experienced homophobia/transphobia (except the ocasional trolls on Twitter) but I'm still ""gay enough"" and ""trans enogh"". Wtf.
Oh my god, I'm so sorry that I see this way too late. I really didn't know that (bc, y'know, I still have a lot to learn). Atm I'm really trying to educate him and tell him that he is just hurting the trans community by excluding non-binary people. Thank you for this btw. If I could, I would give you a thousand upvotes.
Your response is totally understandable. We've been trying to explain to him that he is just wrong but he won't understand.
I‚Äôd be willing to bet he also excludes bi and ace from the LGBT+ spectrum. üôÑ
Well some people are stubborn. I would add something, but pettiness is not fitting in this situation.
Sum ppl choose 2 not understand.  Greatest lesson bein non binary taught me
He is actually bi.  
But, yes, he also doesn't believe asexuality is real.

Why are you spending time with this person?"	k3vvot	NonBinary	21	1.0	2020-11-30 13:35:32
I came out to my parents and it was wonderful	"I just wanted to share this lovely story to you all... In case somebody wants to read someting positive. 

A few days ago, I came out to my parents. My mum is 68 years old, my dad is 71. I am 39 years old, transgender FTM, my wife is 46. Both my parents have quite a respectable age, but they are very sweet-natured people and are very broad-minded. So, last week saturday evening, my wife asked me in a by-the-way-fashion when I would come out to my parents. As a joke I said, ""well, what about now?"". She responded by saying ""ok, let's do this thingy"".   I almost crapped my pants, but we drove off to theirs. My wife called them beforehand to say we were out of decaf, and that we would pass by to have a cup at their place. Of course, we have plenty of decaf :-)

So we were in the kitchen and I pushed the conversation towards gay stuff and next thing, we are talking about a well known, out and proud transgender politician. I then said I was on a waiting list for hormone therapy and that I would be transitioning too. I told them I'm seeing a gender therapist for counseling and guidance during the transitioning process. I also told them that the waiting list is, indeed, shortening. I said to them that I wear a binder and it made me feel so good, and that I wanted to look so much more masc. I explained to them them I've always felt as a tomboy, but that I assured them that I defo did not have a unhappy childhood, because my parents let me wear the clothes I liked and never pushed me to wearing girl stuff. Well, they once tried to make me wear a flowery salopette when I was 7-ish, but they only tried it once because I made a hell of a scene. 

In the end, I let go one of two tears. Then mum said I already told her about the binders! I said, no, defo not, but she inisted. And then se reminded that it was somebody else that told her they are wearing binders (did I mention she is 68 years old?) And then she said ""oh, well, no problem to me"" and then my dad said the same thing. The were so supportive, also a bit worried that some people might react unpleasently, so that I needed to pay attention to that in my gender therapy.  

It was a lovely evening, us four together at the table drinking decaf and chatting. I know I am very lucky to have such parents, and not everyone is in the same situation. I do think, however, that most parents really love their children. I they react badly to your coming out, it's because they are worried and they need time. So, to everyone who still has to come out: your parents love you, they do care. Hopefully, they accept you as you are. 

Have a good weekend :-)"		v9yvjf	NonBinary	22	1.0	2022-06-11 14:37:09
Boobs but otherwise masculine	"I can't believe it took me this long to find this sub! I hope this is the right place to post this; let me know if it's not and I'll gladly move it to a more appropriate sub. If this is the right place, also let me know if I'm using the right flair, etc.

&#x200B;

After living through four gender identities (cis male, trans woman, demigirl, and now gender-apathetic \[I don't care about my own gender\]), and uncountable presentations under these, **I decided to get boobs, but I'm sticking with my otherwise currently-masculine body.** 

I'm keeping my beard, any clothes that still fit through the changes, everything. At least right now, all I want is to add boobs to my current appearance. So, I started wearing homemade breast forms! Here's some photos of the first time I tried this: [https://mastodon.social/@Supuhstar/103365524118220866](https://mastodon.social/@Supuhstar/103365524118220866)

My years-long plan involves me wearing silicone breast forms daily and going through GAHT only until my chest is how I like it, and cutting the hormones. Of course, I'll work with my endocrinologist to find the right balance of hormones to achieve this.

&#x200B;

Everyone has been super supportive, be they cis, NB, trans, etc! But I have gotten a good number of people telling me it looks uncanny, and will take some getting used to. One person even gave me the benefit of a long discussion with me about how they'd always thought about me transitioning MtF, and wasn't prepared for this possibility. It was a nice talk, and we're both looking forward to removing biases we didn't even know we had.

I totally understand all this, and I'm excited to see what else this will show me about the way our society views gender, and what I'll discover about myself. After all, the idea of ""the bearded lady"" has long been shorthand for a freak, and my appearance while wearing these homemade breast forms is currently similar to that. Over the past 11 years, I have prepared myself for all of this, so **I really am just very happy**, and I see any non-support as a fascinating view into social expectations around gender and self-expression, rather than some attack on me or something.

&#x200B;

All that said, **I can't find much in the way of this on the internet. It seems that everyone I can find who wants to have boobs also wants to be femme. Any advice, feedback, etc?** Additionally, **what do you think about boobs being non-feminine?**"	"Gender expression is all your own. If a masc body and boobs make you comfortable, that's all you need to know. Be the role model you wish you had when you were younger. I think you're dope as hell.
Why can't I just take my tits off and give it to you.  They're no good to me anyway.

it‚Äôs been 2y now; i‚Äôm thinking of doing GAHT but i‚Äôm not sure i want to remove my beard.

how have people responded to you :)? do you ever get people acting weirdly?

cheers,
Aww thank you so much üòä
RIGHT?! I have been ranting about this to too many people before lol
But there really needs to be a trans-centric surgery ward, where they literally just transfer organs all the time. AFAIK there's no way for any of my friends who hate their tits to give them to me, even if we won the lottery. I have no idea how such transplants aren't common.

I swear if this isn't a thing by 2050, I might jump careers to make it happen.

Also thank you so much üíô your kindness warms my heart
Yeah that's basically all that came up when searching. It's really cool that he did that and kept them to this day... But AFAIK they're not involved with his gender expression; he did it for a bet and seems to keep them as a statement.

I'd love to be proven wrong! But that's my impression after watching interviews and such.
Things are going well! I started GAHT in May 2020, and played around with some different approaches before settling on my current regimen where I take 50mg/d Progesterone, 4mg/d Estradiol, and a somewhat high 150mg/d Spiro.

My beard is the same as it was before GAHT, and my boobs are a nice B-cup at this point. I also grew out the top of my hair to about a foot and a half, shaving the sides and back of my head.

I get some fun looks and gender confusion! Nothing bad yet, thank goodness, but that's probably largely because I live in Denver where genderfucky people are fairly common.

I think my favorite memory was the way a cashier looked at me when putting my debit card in my bra after paying. That was a priceless moment of them going ""wait... wait what?""

And honestly that's what I'm here for! I love bringing people out of their strict gender boxes and showing them how different folks can be üòÅ

Probably the most annoying parts are having to shop for bras (all brands have different definitions for their sizes, etc.) and boob-sweat. I wasn't prepared for just how different boob sweat would be lol

Also we've discovered that [we're a plural system](https://t.me/s/Supuhstar)! Weird shit lol! Some of us wanted androgyny, some wanted masculinity, some wanted femininity, so we kinda met in the middle at this! I personally enjoy it a lot and all the others have at least one part they enjoy as well ü•≥

AMAB non-binary folks on HRT, what‚Äôs your experience been like?	"I started transitioning socially about 2 years ago, which has been good in a lot of ways, but dysphoria is a hell of a bedfellow and I‚Äôm definitely feeling stuck. At this point, HRT seems like the next logical step in my transition. I of course have a good idea of what physical changes to expect, as well as some emotional ones, but really only in a general sense, and my own research as to what options would be right for me to consider has been less that fruitful. 

I‚Äôd love to hear how your experiences with HRT have been, if you don‚Äôt mind sharing of course. And if you do identify as non-binary, I would also love to know how HRT has affected your relationship to your body and your gender identity/expression. Any and all perspective is appreciated üòä

PS: I will be seeing my PCP soon to talk about this, so any advice or definitely-ask-questions for that scenario are much appreciated as well. For reference, I‚Äôm an AMAB trans/non-binary person in my early 30s, living in a pretty blue state in the US. Between my insurance and geography, I don‚Äôt foresee any issues accessing type of care (ü§û)"	"amab enby, 30, one year social transition / six months hrt

I was originally terrified of estrogen. I knew that I wanted to shed myself of all the extant masculinity, but I was unsure about some of the physical changes, namely breast development and penile atrophy. however, I felt that I had reached a plateau in that while the dysphoria demons were kept at bay by publicly coming out and living as a transfemme enby full time, they were still waiting at the gates, and I could hear their vicious whispers if I had too much quiet/alone time. 

starting hrt was like being given the skeleton key that unlocked thoughts, emotions, and feelings which had been locked away by living a lifetime with the 'real me' buried deep down. it felt like I'd been playing through life in hardmode, with my ability to perceive hamstrung from the beginning, and then suddenly being fully in touch with all of my faculties. I couldn't believe that I'd conned and gaslit myself into thinking that how I had been living was normal. I remember being incredulous at the notion that cis people must have been feeling and living this way all along, while I'd suffered through three decades of running on fumes. I'd been saddled with a lifelong, all-encompassing depression that simply *went away* shortly after starting. I'd finally been made whole. 

my relationship with my body and how I view my gender identity has definitely changed. what I once feared, I now embrace -- the breast growth that began in December wasn't shocking or scary, but a source of glee. seeing the light in my eyes for the first time as my face slowly feminized (and without a denial beard) made me develop a sense of compassion for myself that I'd never had before. I knew that I was headed in the right direction, and didn't want to miss out on even another second of living this new life filled with vibrancy -- the life I'd always deserved. over the six months I've been on hrt, I've increased my dosages every couple of months (monitoring blood hormone levels to do so) until my T was nuked down and E was lifted up to cis female levels,  and I've never felt more connected to myself than I do now. for the time being I enjoy having a somewhat functional (albeit greatly decreased in size) penis, but I'm finding myself daydreaming about bottom surgery. idk where I'll settle on that one, but everything else has been *perfect*.

when I originally came out as non-binary, I knew that I skewed much closer to female than male, but as my hormone levels changed, so too has the ""distance"" along the spectrum relative to my agab starting point. I currently feel very much like a non-binary woman and identify as a lesbian, if that tells you anything. expression-wise I have been high femme from the start, but after reaching the milestone of an estrogen-dominant body, I purged all of my old boy clothes and haven't looked back. I embrace my femininity and reject the remaining traces of masculinity.
So I‚Äôm not sure how helpful my experience will be, but I‚Äôll give it to you just in case.

I‚Äôm an amab nb with a desire to lean towards being feminine. I‚Äôve been doing HRT for two months now and I‚Äôm enjoying it. My relationship to body has improved probably both due to getting more exercise lately as well as the comfort of knowing my fat will eventually distribute itself to give me a more feminine shape. I feel a desire to work on myself for myself and my goals. My gender expression hasn‚Äôt changed a whole lot yet. Still working on getting clothes and whatnot. I‚Äôve always been a bit of an effeminate person, so I never felt the need to change much. I mostly wear sweatpants and sweaters, but that‚Äôll change as it gets warmer. For me it was the right decision as I want to move away from my masculinity more. Especially since I don‚Äôt want to get older and more masculine. HRT will do me more for the future than for the present. That‚Äôs about it I guess. Hope I was of some help
It's been soooo much better than I even thought it would be. The total indifference and separation I felt from my body is being replaced by a sense of contentment. My emotions are deeper but more stable too. I looked at my old driver's license photo the other day, and realized there's no way I'll ever want to go back. 

I was worried about sexual dysfunction, as I think a lot of people are. The whole use it or lose it thing is totally true though. I've also found progesterone helps with libido, which is now about the same as it was before transition. Idk if that's a concern for you but I wish I'd heard more people saying that before I started transition.
I started off HRT 5 years ago as a baby trans girl.

I am now a sapphic enby catboy gender disaster. And my skin is very soft.
In case it's relevant, I'm 22, in a red state, and don't have health insurance.

Accessing it was fairly easy (I went through Plume), literally a 15 minute video call with a doctor and I had a prescription. Skin softening was almost immediate, as were changes to my brain chemistry. Be prepared to be a lot more emotional over absolutely nothing. After a couple months I noticed the very beginnings of breast growth, but nothing noticeable until probably another 4-5 months I think. I've also gained a bit of weight, particular on my hips, belly, butt, and thighs, and at this stage my boobs are a solid handful. Body/facial hair has thinned some, but not so much as to make me feel comfortable with not shaving. After I think 6-8 months is when noticed the changes downstairs. Random erections are now non-existent, and there's usually a bit of discomfort otherwise (atrophy). Ejaculate is also all but gone, but getting off is still just as easy as ever.

As far as socially, not much has changed. I still get called ""sir"" by customers and am generally seen as my AGAB. But I have felt more and more comfortable changing up how I present, but I don't think that's related to the HRT changes.
Thank you for sharing! I very much like how you write üòä I am very much looking forward to hopefully unlocking my own emotions. My upbringing has made me very unreactive emotionally but since coming out I‚Äôve noticed small but meaningful changes in that. Here‚Äôs hoping HRT unlocks a bit more of that for me
That was a beautiful read, thanks for sharing
This is beautiful ü•≤
Thank you! This is very helpful. I love the long-term thinking with this as well. It‚Äôs very easy for me to be myopic when the dysphoria is hittin, but I am hopeful that taking this step will increase my quality of life the further I go into it
Thank you! This is very helpful. Glad to hear you are feeling more connected to your body and your emotions‚Äîthat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm primarily hoping to achieve with this. I am definitely a bit worried about the sexual dysfunction as well, but I have not heard of the ‚Äúuse-it-or-lose-it‚Äù concept; something worth looking into for sure.
thank you in kind for your response ü•∞

but absolutely, so much this. it took eliminating testosterone for me to realize that its presence in my body and brain was causing me to feel emotion by proxy -- I knew when I *should* be happy and what it was *supposed* to feel like, but I never truly felt it. same for sadness. I thought I was a sociopath for awhile because of it. it's like my experience of emotion was lacroix while everyone else's was soda, and I couldn't understand why. I felt broken. now, it gets better every day. 

I truly wish you all the luck and strength in the world on your new journey. we all deserve to feel completely.
Yeah, you'll see posts from trans femmes with bottom dysphoria who are really happy that hormones have shut off everything down there, which is awesome for them. But if keeping function is important, using ""the equipment"" regularly will usually prevent atrophy and dysfunction even with nuked T. And of course hormonal transition isn't black and white, and you don't have to bring T super low either unless you want to. 

I did find that Spiro killed my libido, which is common but not universal. My response was to get off it, use estrogen injection mono therapy to lower T, and progesterone to sustain libido. Transition is choose your own adventure, and you can make course adjustments as you go, based on your goals"	tw2e1u	NonBinary	22	1.0	2022-04-04 13:45:21
My partner is transitioning, and I need help.	"I've been dating my partner for a year now, and I have noticed small things here and there that they weren't completely happy in their skin. They mentioned early on about being non-binary but it was something that wasn't really talked about at the time. 

 The only experience I had with someone being non binary was a youtube celebrity Lindsay Jones, and from what I gathered at the time, it was more of how one prefers to be referred to as(they/them). They still were married to a straight guy and had two kids. Anyway for awhile that's how I thought things were, but I learned recently they have an appointment set in a few months to have testosterone injections and a breast reduction in the future which I never been against of. 

I love my partner more than anything they have been a wonderful experience and I wouldn't trade anything to be with them. The problem started when they asked if I was gonna be okay with them not being a girl anymore. I mentioned how I do find femininity and the like attractive. But I never been in this situation where someone is transitioning. They mention how they'll have a deeper voice and harrier body and honestly I don't care I just can't say for certain it will be a turn on to me. I never been in this kind of situation  before.

I just want to be supportive I want to understand but i don't know how to approach the situation without them getting hot headed about me not knowing certain things and it's really hard for me who has always just referred to anyone I'm talking about and she or he and while it accidentally slips out I'm fully aware of my mistake and I just want to know what exactly I'm supposed to do. This is a very important change in their life and I want to show I'm in full support but I need time to adjust."	"I can't speak for all partners but I only started really identifying as nonbinary in the last few years. My wife and I have been together for almost 11 years and married for 5 of those. I've always been on the slightly more masculine side of things but when we met and started dating I was very much identifying as a cis lesbian who was dating a bisexual woman. 

I give you all that background just for context. But I know my wife wasn't expecting me to identify as nonbinary. For me what has been supportive is any kind of effort she makes. And she has openly said ""this is all new information and im not familiar with ____ ""(whatever we might be discussing). 

I think its important that you and your partner can calmly communicate about these things. Be open and say ""I support you and your decisions, but I never have gone through anything like this personally or with a partner"". And ask them to correct you when you say incorrect things. But let them know that it's never to intentionally hurt them. 

I had to do a lot of research and reading before I became comfortable in my nonbinary identity and I don't expect my partner to suddenly know how I'm feeling or what I would prefer. She has said ""I don't know what you would prefer without you telling me. If you tell me anything different I'll start using those words instead"". And like honestly that was the most meaningful. 

I have no idea if this long response was helpful. But like. I love that you're doing your best to support your partner. And doing your own research to support them üíï

TL;DR Communicate with each other and let you know you want to support them but you'll need help from them to know how best to do so.
I've been in a similar situation. When I started dating my partner, they were female but in the process of exploring nonbinary identity, and eventually started on testosterone. I self described at the time as a heteroflexible cis-man. (I've been feeling more genderfluid lately.) Here's my advice.

1. Don't panic, don't assume, don't jump to conclusions. Your partner might not know where their gender feelings might stabilize, or if they will. Some people's experience and expression of gender remains unfixed and evolving over time.
2. Acknowledge the possibility that you and your partner may eventually be sexually incompatible. Your partner needs to be their most authentic self, and so do you. Explore flexibility and keep an open-mind.
3. Talk about this process with anyone who may have been in a similar circumstance. A personal connection is better than this anonymous reddit connection, but this is already better than nothing. I sought out the counsel of a good friend who had also experienced this gender evolution in a relationship.
4. Let this spur you to re-examine your own gender and sexual identity. I was lucky to already identify as ""not 100% straight,"" just mostly straight. If you're male, then you might find that there's some internalized homophobia to unpack. I know that I was in a position where even though I was in full anti-homophobic support of everyone living whatever gender and sexual lives they felt like living, there were still internalized ""don't be gay"" messages and fears which led me to feel anxious about a partner's transition. I also recognized ways in which porn was reinforcing a more narrow sexual script and range of physical attractiveness. If you do consume porn then you can also use this as a tool to examine the boundaries of what you find attractive.

Good luck and stay true to yourself. If you do find that you can continue to find your partner sexually attractive, then you might be in for a major upside. Testosterone treatments can increase sex drive significantly.
Talk to them. If it were me, I would want you to ask questions instead of make assumptions. (Not saying you have, speaking from my own experience) Everyone is different in how they may identify and the best source of information about your partner is your partner. Let them know it‚Äôs new for you and that you want to be supportive, and the best way is to learn from them what they are feeling, how they identify, etc.  That is at least what I would want or hope for from my partner. For them to listen, be understanding, and hopefully accept me for who I am.
You might want to read some books on gender identity. If you want to be a supportive partner jump in there and really get educated on it. If I saw my partner reading a book for me I would be so happy. 

Also while absorbing this information start thinking more about things on a spectrum. Everyone has some amount of body hair, minus folks with certain conditions, but some women are more hairy and some men as less hairy. Some non-binary people are more and less hairy. 

Personality is a big turn on.  You might find your own definition for what turns you on and what you are attracted to might not be 1:1 with boring established simple terms. Maybe they are and that‚Äôs ok. But I‚Äôve found once I‚Äôve given myself permission to explore outside of a binary gender and labels like gay and straight there is a entire spectrum of nuisances and options that I never considered or repressed from thinking about. 

Just something to explore and no harm no foul. You aren‚Äôt going to trick yourself into turning trans or gay or straight or anything else. Even if you find you are just as you always thought the information, self reflection and journey will be skills and experiences directly transferable to understanding and supporting your partner.
I‚Äôm going through the same thing! My partner is nonbinary and is considering hormone therapy and I‚Äôm struggling to grasp what that would mean for my attraction to them. I love them more than anything and want to be with them, but I‚Äôm still trying to find my level of comfortably of them presenting as more femme when I find masculinity attractive. I am trying to be supportive because I know that‚Äôs what they need the most right now, but it still seems difficult. We‚Äôve had many a talks the last few days and it seems like we‚Äôre in a better place now. Hopefully you and your partner can work it out so you are both happy in the long run. Best of luck!
I wrote this guide for this situation since the layers of gender run deep and feelings run strong. [https://medium.com/@therealphil/if-your-so-just-announced-they-are-trans-37bb62effeb6](https://medium.com/@therealphil/if-your-so-just-announced-they-are-trans-37bb62effeb6) 

But if you can do it and keep talking through this you will be ready to talk through and survive other challenges to any LTR.
I have some insight here, as they enby partner who is dating a cis woman who was under the impression that I was a relatively femme woman when we started dating. She was similar to you in that she had an idea that I wasn‚Äôt fully comfortable and I told her recently that I am nonbinary and taking steps to go on t. She is also typically attracted to more femme people, but also does identify as bi/queer. The biggest thing I can say is communicate. You won‚Äôt know until things happen whether you like them or not, and you just need to have open communication with your partner. Your partner also needs to communicate with you, how they are feeling, changes they are having etc. when you are in a relationship, transition is kind of a 2 person process and you need that support. On YouTube, check out megemiko. They are a nonbinary person who was dating someone as they transitioned and they talk about it in some videos. Best wishes to you and your partner!
I am on the nonbinary partner in this situation. I'm AFAB and bi and my partner is a straight guy. I'm struggling to figure out how to validate his feelings that I'm more attractive when I'm more feminine and my feelings about wanting to present more androgynously. I hesitate to discuss this with him until I know the right words to say so I don't invalidate him. So I really appreciate your honesty
This is really helpful tysm!!!!
I am so glad! Please let me know wherever it doesn't work to stepwise keep the communication open."	11fi50p	NonBinary	18	0.86	2023-03-01 21:08:31
AMAB NB - rambles on penis dysphoria, sex, patchwork gender and inaccessible identities	"Deleted (I got nervous), then reposted.

Hi, I'm confused.

As the title suggests, I am AMAB. I wouldn't describe myself as fem, but I am fairly avoidant of masculinity.

I have lots of stories in my head about patriarchical forms of masculinity, and that my repression of my masculinity is likely due to my experience of men in my life, and not wanting to become that - being terrified that if I let myself ""be a man"" in any way, I would become that. To be clear - I don't believe that I would become evil, but up until recently, I thought that the fear of being evil is what stops me from expressing my masculinity - that my avoidance of masculinity was almost entirely about the social implications of being masculine - I am afraid of having harmful impact, and that my confusing feelings about my penis were caused by that fear, but now I'm wondering the opposite - if dysphoria is feeding my fear of the social implications of masculinity, rather than the other way around.

I haven't ever had my penis involved in sex. As I type this, I recognize the way that my penis feels like a separate being, and that if it touches me, I only feel it through seven layers of canvas - barely, that is.

I masturbate often, but as a chore, unless I'm bringing out butt toys. I love giving partners pleasure, and I love anal play and nipple play, and hands all over my body, passionate cuddles, playful experiments and making out and all kinds of fun and games, but my penis hasn't been involved.

My penis (MY penis??) is NOT off limits, but I have never gotten fully hard in front of another person, and I've never encouraged a partner to try and get me hard, or felt like a partner was particularly thrilled to handle my penis. I imagine with a partner where I had total trust that my penis was wanted, maybe I could get hard. Maybe I could overcome the anxiety. I don't know.

I want my penis to be involved in sex - I think. I want to be able to get blowjobs and penetrate someone and especially to be able to cum with a partner. I feel something is lacking in my expression of my sexuality because I don't use my penis, and I think that that is probably more than just that I'm not having orgasms, I think it's also about really actually just wanting to use my penis, plain and simple.

I also feel social pressure from two directions - I feel like I'm supposed to want sex - that I'm supposed to be making sure I get my dick wet, and that I'm supposed to enjoy that - because that's what's normal; and I also feel like I'm supposed to not want anything to do with my penis - that I'm clearly not normal, and not a boy, and that my penis is symbolic of all male rage and patriarchal oppression, so I shouldn't want anything to do with it.

And both of those things are true, and neither of them are true, and I don't know what I want.

Being sexual with cis girls is new for me. I spent high school (graduated 4 years ago) as a gay boy who knew they were androgynous but didn't care much about words and categories so *shrug* sure, I'm a gay boy.
Eventually I started noticing attraction for more than just boys and so I stopped calling myself a gay boy. Since then, I've had a recent string of ftm partners, a limited number of cis men, and one wonderful MtF darling. Recently I started playing with a cis girl and exploring how I do relate to her- and guess what? I'm confused here too. I want to be strong and hold her and provide things and carry heavy things and be the big spoon and other things I associate with traditional masculinity, while being feminine. I'm struggling with the idea that engaging in those behaviors with someone who is seen as a woman makes me look more masculine. Being in what sometimes appears to be a heterosexual pairing is a dysphoric experience - and at the same time I love it. That alone isn't super confusing, but I've had moments of feeling identified with the word lesbian or sapphic, and I'm not sure how to relate to that word. I feel choosing it oversteps my bounds as an AMAB person who isn't particularly femme. The words don't really matter that much to me, but I too often don't explore further because I decide that the words don't matter, so I'm choosing to explore. 

Even if I felt fully affirmed that sapphic is an appropriate word to use and had comes to terms with it fully, there is another confusing aspect.

Recently, I've started to imagine what I wish my body looked like. In younger years I loved the idea of having boobs, but lately, the body type that comes to mind is a flat chest, lack of facial hair, a lower hairline, and I wish I had a vulva - but with bottom growth. I often wish I were a trans man, or a masc leaning AFAB enby.

FtM is an identity that is not accessible to me. It isn't just confusing, it is factually innacurate to apply to me - not to mention that I kinda feel like I'm conflating the fact that trans men are men with some idea of what it would be like to have a certain body type that comes from being AFAB and physically transitioning.

So maybe I'm masc-leaning, but I know I'm not. 

Maybe I just want to be neutral and fluid and non conforming without having a penis, and the boldest way I can imagine of doing that is by being someone with a vulva who presents as a boy. 

Nothing I've stated and no identity I've claimed throughout this post - including the physically measurable one's, like AMAB, feel fully real to me, but none of them are false. I exist in an in-between world, and I want words to understand myself with, but none of them make any sense. Everything about the way that I exist in social implications of gender roles, presentation, and expectations is mixed and matched. Crop tops make me feel femme, denim and buttondowns feel neutral depending on the level of flowyness, and skirts make me feel particularly masculine. Wires are crossed, my reactions are opposite what I expect, and everything is patched together into a confounding mess that fills my intimate interactions with people with anxiety and paralysis- even my wonderfully queer, sex and touch positive, incredibly supportive group of close people.

Anyone have any reflections, similar experiences, comparisons, or insight into the experience of AMAB enbys in western culture?"	"Hey,

I‚Äôm glad that you reposted this as this really is a safe space and I hope that you can connect with others who can offer insight that could help. I'm really sorry that this has ended up being a complete essay but I hope it helps somewhat.

CW: Sex, bullying, homophobia, abuse, sexual assault

>!I‚Äôm AMAB. I‚Äôve never felt much of a connection to being ‚Äúmale‚Äù. People describe my personality and expression as effeminate and having feminine characteristics (my bf says he likes this), but I just see myself as me and I don‚Äôt see masculinity as something I need to be concerned with. Like, I never have and I‚Äôve always presented in a variety of masculine or androgynous ways depending on how I‚Äôm feeling. I identify as gay and I think I fit the stereotype of an effeminate gay man even though I don‚Äôt really identify with the ‚Äúman‚Äù part. I realised a while ago that lots of my gay friends who are men, including my bf, happily identify as male and I realised that I might see my identity differently and found that nonbinary is a good fit for me.!<

>!My Dad was abusive in a domineering, chauvinistic, homophobic way. I was scared of him growing up, he was violent towards me, and I was later scared of becoming like him. I never want to be like that and I hate that he felt empowered to be such a bully and to expect me to do the same just because of my sex. (He was also a victim of patriarchy/toxic masculinity in a way and never learned to control his emotions etc.) !<

>!I was bullied all through school for being gay and effeminate and most of the bullying was focusing on my gender performance and was perpetuated by males. It impacted me deeply and took me years to get over. I hated being around guys or being grouped with guys at times. Sometimes I‚Äôve wondered if I have trouble identifying as male because of the lack of positive male role models in my life and the effects of gender violence and toxic masculinity on me. I think that‚Äôs a chicken and egg kind of question and maybe my identity caused me to stand out and get pushed around because I‚Äôve always felt different. Maybe it‚Äôs both. Do I feel uncomfortable with masculinity because of my experience with abuse or because of my identity? But then I think about other men who grow up in abusive environments or are raised by single Mums and have no problem as identifying as male and go on to be amazingly caring, supportive guys. I‚Äôm at the age now where some of my friends are starting to become Dads and it‚Äôs beautiful to see them being the supportive, sensitive and caring kind of Dads I think the world needs more of. In a way it doesn‚Äôt matter what‚Äôs caused me to identify as nonbinary. If I‚Äôm comfortable in this identity, then it doesn‚Äôt matter the reasons why.
What has really helped me is learning that the way I view my identity might be different to most cis people and it has helped me a lot to learn about dysphoria and to understand when it‚Äôs acting on me. In some ways by coming out and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nonbinary‚Äù, it‚Äôs almost conversely helped me embrace masculinity and presenting as male, because I now feel secure in how I feel about my identity (which is kinda neutral) and I can disentangle that from presentation and looking like a typical dude if I want. (I don‚Äôt see why clothes, makeup etc, have labels though and I also enjoy dressing how I want and always have.)
I‚Äôm gay and I‚Äôm drawn to men and masculinity to some extent and I think it‚Äôs okay to recognise that not all expressions of masculinity are toxic (this is very much debatable though). !<

>!I experience dysphoria when people expect me to perform a role and with dress codes and that sort of thing, but I‚Äôve never experienced it with my body. My perspective might not be very helpful to you, but maybe it will. I‚Äôve worked really hard to feel good about my body. I‚Äôve had to work to shake off internalised transphobia and a nagging feeling that feeling comfortable presenting as male is somehow in contest with identifying as nonbinary or doing feminine things (because it isn‚Äôt).!<

>!I really want everyone to feel like they can live as comfortable and authentically as possible. I totally support people who experience dysphoria with their bodies and work to change that. I personally have worked hard to love my (imperfect) body and would also like people to be able to feel the same.!<

>!I think some people view the penis as a symbol of masculinity and I guess for obvious reasons. It‚Äôs almost seen as a violent weapon and it can feel sometimes like even owning one is a violent act. A lot of sexual assault legislation, for example, makes a distinction between penetration by a penis and assault by other means. Guys worry about their penises and are uncomfortable exposing themselves because of their insecurities about being ""man enough"" etc, like it‚Äôs super important and relevant to a masculine identity. But guys come in all sorts of bodies and I think it‚Äôs useful to remember that this is just a societal association. Maybe you‚Äôve internalised some of this anxiety, or maybe it‚Äôs related to body dysphoria, or maybe not.
I think it‚Äôs useful to remember it‚Äôs just a body part that gets hard and has nerve endings. It doesn‚Äôt need to be a symbol of anything and I‚Äôd personally really like people to be able to feel good with their bodies. If possible, I‚Äôd really like you to feel like you can enjoy your body and sexuality and to feel comfortable with that in any way you want because you deserve to.
I read a report a while ago of a school where there was an assembly about feminism and all the boys were told to turn to a nearby girl and to apologise for patriarchy. In reading about feminism and in trying to be more conscientious it‚Äôs possible to end up feeling guilty. I realised a while ago I had probably learned to mansplain and I worked really hard to stop that. While I think everyone benefits from raised awareness of the effects of patriarchy and male privilege, I think that inducing feelings of guilt in males just for being born that way or having that identity is really unhelpful. I personally think I can enjoy lifting weights, dressing in a typically masculine way and enjoy sex without that needing to say anything about my gender identity or views on toxic masculinity and society.!<

>!Your description of feeling disconnected or disinterested in penile stimulation with partners reminds me of experiences I‚Äôve read about asexual intercourse (people who might not typically experience or have much interest concerning sexual attraction but might still potentially have sex and masturbate). I‚Äôm not saying this is necessarily the case, but I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôve looked at it from that angle?!<

>!I‚Äôve also read about and have had personal experiences with (gay) men who are very focused on being a bottom and/or very focused on their partner‚Äôs pleasure and enjoy engaging in sex in a way where they‚Äôre not concerned about their own penis and sometimes find it freeing/more pleasurable to wear a chastity cage during sex just to help them focus on what feels important to them. This is a super valid way to enjoy sexuality as well and can be a lot of fun. You might read into that and say they are performing more of a ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù role. I‚Äôm personally more comfortable being submissive sexually. I‚Äôll be more dominant if my partner wants and I enjoy performing that role to give them pleasure, but it feels like a performance and less like how I really feel when I do that. I suppose you could say that‚Äôs an expression of my more feminine gender identity, although I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of cis guys who enjoy being submissive or focusing on anal or other facets of sex that aren‚Äôt penis-centric.!<

>!I think you can question whether people of different genders experience sex differently. While I‚Äôm sure there is some effect, I think you can easily fall into stereotyping and the way that sex is seen as something that men own and women are chastised for being ‚Äúslutty‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a view that‚Äôs helpful to anyone. In this vein I think it‚Äôs really cool if men can explore being submissive and basically people can just do enjoy what they want without worrying about fitting into a particular role. I think, for me, I‚Äôm lucky that I‚Äôve always had sex in a gay context where there are less expectations about roles and it‚Äôs easier to play with that ‚Äì that‚Äôs generalising though and that‚Äôs not to say that sex in other contexts can‚Äôt explore this. I personally think it‚Äôs helpful to disentangle what is a masculine or feminine performance and what is just two people exploring and connecting with their bodies. I'm not sure I experience a sense of gender identity very strongly though, so my views might come across as more ambivalent than most.!<

>!Feeling like you‚Äôre supposed to want sex is very common in people who are assigned male and this causes men be more likely to feel pressured into sex when they aren‚Äôt ready and less likely to see themselves as being forced into something or assaulted because they are ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù want it. (Some of my professional work is with sexual assault victims at the moment).!<
First thank you so much for posting this. I started crying before I got through with it. I've been struggling to figure myself out recently. Its been a painful part of it that it seems like while there are tons of trans, enby, genderqueer, and everything else people out there and they've all been inclusive and accepting of me, none of them really seem to be like me. I see a lot of how I feel in your post and it was really nice to know I'm not alone.

I'm AMAB, I've never really felt manly and didn't have much interest in a lot of typically manly things although there are some. Clothes are at meh for me, I've been fine with comfortable and functional, for most of my life I've felt like if it were socially acceptable I'd wear a grey jumpsuit every day. However since starting to question my gender I've experimented with skirts and some more fem clothes and its been fun. I'm not really sure yet how much of that is its been fun to be able to explore my gender and how much is the actual clothes being right for me. I think I'd still opt for a comfortable jumpsuit most days.

I've had a lot of the same feelings about my masculinity and patriarchy, how I'd be an awful oppressive person if I let more masculine parts of myself come though. I've at best felt embarrassed about my penis and more often felt ashamed and gross. Getting a random erection has often made me feel disgusting. Like my body was doing something wrong. I masturbate but a lot less than most guys, and often as a chore. I hate the way my body feels if I go too long without cumming. The heightened awareness of my genitals and intrusive hornyness feel gross.

I've identified as gay for a long time but it took me some time to get there and now that I'm questioning my gender I'm less certain of it. I'm primarily interested in men. But some women are attractive in that way for me. My first partner was a cis woman and boy was it a disaster. I was The Man of the relationship and emulated a lot of toxic things I was raised with but also penetrating her was a deeply conflicted thing for me. I would usually struggle to stay hard and to finish, if I could. Doing other sexual things with her was great but as soon as my penis went in it stopped being fun. If I finished I often felt gross or like I had done something awful no matter how much she said she enjoyed it. I'd often cry silently to myself when we cuddled afterwards. Later when I was with men there wasn't that expectation and I was able to just be a bottom and not worry about it so I figured I was gay with a touch of bi. I also got more comfortable with myself and realized I'm very into being submissive and focusing on pleasuring my partner. I really enjoy giving blowjobs and some of the best sex I've had involved getting him off a couple of times and I didn't at all and had no desire to.

Well several months ago all things gender kind of exploded for me. I was hooking up with an FtM friend. As I said I'm submissive and one thing I enjoy is using a chastity cage so I was in one. They wanted to get fucked and I wanted to stay locked up so I used their strapon and holy shit it was amazing. I felt present and connected with them in a way I never had before when topping or really ever when using my penis. I realized that when my penis was involved I had almost always been dissociating to some extent. For the first time ever I understood how topping could be something that someone would actually enjoy.

I've pretty much always had interest in having a vagina. Sometimes it was just an absentminded 'Oh I wonder what its like' but other times it was 'oh it'd be a lot more fun to have one' or 'girls are so lucky to have a vagina instead of a penis' or 'It would be really nice if <boy I liked> could fuck my pussy' looking back I don't really know how I convinced myself that those thoughts weren't anything meaningful and just ignored them. But realizing how bad I felt using my penis compared to what sex was like when fully present opened the floodgates. 

But I don't have any interest in being a girl. Thinking of having breasts or curves doesn't gross me out but it also doesn't have any appeal, at most a vague kind of ""well that'd be different."" But when I think about my ideal body I have flat chest, am still hairy, but I have a vulva and vagina but as you I want some growth. A micropenis or transdick that could be played with or sucked on but not penetrate. As I said I've been with a couple of FtM/afab enby people and I find that body type incredibly attractive. At times I've actually been uncomfortable with how much I like it since it makes me worry I'm fetishizing them. Now that I'm acknowledging my gender I'm not so worried but it does kind of linger as self doubt.

The best label/description for myself I've come up with is amab transmasc guy. I do identify as male, mostly. But I'm not cis since I definitely don't want a penis and do want afab female genitalia. I am kind of nonbinary but that feels strongly associated with androgynous or mixed presentation which mostly doesn't fit me.

In a lot of ways I feel like the odd one out in trans groups, a group that's usually considered the odd ones out. I've found a lot of people who share some of what I feel but they always had a lot that didn't feel anything like how I felt. The trans communities I've been in and the trans people I've known have always been fully welcoming and accepting of me but it felt very lonely that nobody was really like me. Your post is the first that matched my feelings and desires closely enough that I felt like it really was the same experience as mine. I actually broke down crying when you talked about wanting to be transmasc.
Just wanted to say how incredible it was to read this post. I experience some of the same things. I never read them being expressed this way. I‚Äôve had penis dysphoria (that I‚Äôm aware of) for maybe around 2 years. I‚Äôve never really been fully able to enjoy sex, but up until my last breakup, I also always identified mostly as male and bicurious hetero. But I always felt like there was something wrong. I questioned my gender, but I knew I found women attractive for the most part. Now, I realize that part of that has always been a sort of envy as well, for their gender, its roles and its expression. Like the way women dress, their mannerisms, the importance of beauty, emotions‚Ä¶ these are all things that have mattered to me more than any masculine trait. I grew up in a country where boys and girls go to different schools tho, so I was rarely ever exposed to these things until I moved to a different country. 

Now, I realize how much of a chore it feels like to masturbate. But, like someone else here says, I kind of hate how intense and horny I get when I don‚Äôt masturbate for a long time! And, side note, I also find skirts suuper masculine! Anyhow, I struggle to find partners who would be interested in me, because I‚Äôm mostly interested in cis women right now (and in the past too). I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs more gender envy or attraction, but I feel ashamed about it, because trans women are women too, and also, I feel more like a woman than a man, why am I not attracted to other people who are like me? Amab but feeling (and sometimes presenting) as feminine as they can (according to our standards!). It‚Äôs all very, very confusing, and I end up not wanting to get close to anyone and just avoid dating altogether. Even sex feels messed up, because first, I can‚Äôt meet people who would quickly see/accept that I‚Äôm not my penis, meaning I‚Äôm not defined sexually by it, and still want me! And second, I haven‚Äôt experimented much with bottoming and I don‚Äôt know if I would enjoy it, but the only context I have enjoyed it has been with a cis woman, which, again, super confusing? Maybe I‚Äôm just very submissive, and I‚Äôve been stuck in roles that don‚Äôt feel right for me?

One thing that has made me feel somewhat calmer, and made me forget about my genital and body dysphoria has been trying on ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs‚Äù clothing. I have larger hips than the ‚Äútypical‚Äù man, and I find that these clothes just fit me better, and make me look more beautiful. In a deeper sense, it‚Äôs also forced a change in my relationship with my father, my family and my friends. I am less expected to fulfill traditionally masculine gender roles, which is great! But it‚Äôs still a work in progress. I wanted to be perceived as precious and dainty, and for my emotions to have a place in the conversation. In my previous relationship, I was the happiest I had been while dating, and I think that‚Äôs partly because my partner (she) saw a lot of these things in me and honoured them. The rest of my family was oblivious, treated me as a boy, wanted me to be tough, kept criticizing me for being to sensitive, and it honestly broke me! It‚Äôs one of the reasons why I‚Äôve tried again and again (and I‚Äôm still trying) to break with anything remotely masculine! That‚Äôs the thing, even the ‚Äúnon-toxic‚Äù masculine traits, like being tough, or protective (in a way that prioritizes others‚Äô well-being over your own) feels super dysphoric to me, because I‚Äôve performed these roles most of my life and I feel like I‚Äôm dying inside, and I didn‚Äôt know how to step out of them because that‚Äôs all that people seemed to appreciate about me, and I‚Äôm so much more than that! I‚Äôm not even tough. Not in that way! I can survive a lot, but I‚Äôm super fucking sensitive!

So, I‚Äôve thought about transitioning mtf. I don‚Äôt necessarily want breasts. I don‚Äôt know how I feel about having them. I know I want a vulva+vagina, because I fantasize about having sex that way all the time. I‚Äôm a bit afraid that I would be attracted differently if I transition. Right now, I want nothing to do with men, especially in an intimate context. But maybe that would change anyways. I also don‚Äôt know if I want my face and hips to change. I do know that facial hair makes me feel dysphoric, and chest hair‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how I feel about that. But I have heard from a trans woman that many trans women stop taking t blockers and maybe my face hair would regrow if I did. So‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not a permanent solution I guess. I do enjoy the idea of not losing my hair! I mean, fuck! Testosterone really ravages your body! Why is that?? Has it always been this way or is it the stress of capitalism? I believe amab just labels you for trauma of the worst kind no matter who you are! At this point, I don‚Äôt know what to do about hormones/surgery, but it would be really nice to have a vulva, and I‚Äôm not sure you can have one without hormone therapy (because sex hormones are an important part of our physiology and I‚Äôm not sure if we keep producing them post-surgery). 

So, all in all, I‚Äôm working through my issues on the matter. I think masculinity of all kinds is sort of toxic. Competition has never felt healthy to me, whether I won or lost, because even when I won, someone else has had to lose, and I can‚Äôt take joy in that. I think the thing we call masculinity is a byproduct of our evolution, how we got here, and our current systems. Maybe I associate my penis as a symbol with all that, and maybe that‚Äôs not fair. I just want to have sexual pleasure without thinking too hard about it. And I want to take pleasure in masturbating or orgasming, and for it not to feel like a chore. I want to love my body as it is, because it gives me so much, but lately (as long as I‚Äôve started looking into these feelings), it‚Äôs been super hard to dissociate the idea of ‚Äúman‚Äù and my body, especially since people call me Sir or use he all the time. I don‚Äôt really know what to change, but clothes have helped, and I‚Äôm looking for solutions everywhere! I love looking like a fancy bitch when I go out, and it‚Äôs paradoxically something that rings ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù in my mind, because of how bold and daring it is to dress in a skirt with my body, but that‚Äôs one of the many stereotypes I‚Äôm undoing. I just look fucking hot in a skirt. That is all.

Oh, and I identify as trans non-binary, genderfluid, woman, and terribly queer!
My advice would be, first that I really see where you‚Äôre coming from with looking at masculinity, your own identity, your sexuality and trying to disentangle how you feel from toxic masculinity and all that. You are entitled to enjoy using your body in any way that is safe and consensual and I would advise you to see if you can disassociate this from any sort of guilt, confusion or anxiety around toxic masculinity. Of course if you're experiencing dysphoria or something like that, you'll need to figure out what's right for you and what you want. 

Enjoying your sexuality doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to have an impact on this and you are entitled to enjoy your body. If you want to try using your penis in a sexual context, then you really deserve to be able to explore that with a partner, and if you find that you like it or find that you don‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs fine too and doesn‚Äôt have to mean anything.  
I‚Äôve always had an androcentric experience of attraction and that includes all sorts of men and nonbinary people. I‚Äôm also sometimes interested in women and I think that‚Äôs something I could explore too. Your description of feeling like you‚Äôre fulfilling a masculine role in a ‚Äúheterosexual‚Äù relationship sounds to me like you‚Äôre very focused and interested in giving your partner what they are looking for and what would help them feel good. I don‚Äôt know if you have to read this as a gendered performance as such, more as someone who is very focused on their partner‚Äôs wants, needs or what you feel they want (see my comment above about men who enjoy having sex in chastity). That‚Äôs just my view though and you could see this as an expression of gender identity too I suppose.

In terms of how you feel about your body, I‚Äôve personally made peace with and have come to love the body I‚Äôm in and I‚Äôve realised that identity transcends the body and I can express myself and feel attracted to whatever identities feel right and there‚Äôs no need for this to be limited by physical characteristics or labels. Gay man (nonbinary androcentric person) is a good approximant but it‚Äôs just a label and labels are imperfect.

I don‚Äôt know if this any of this helps, and I may have understood your perspective as you are an individual and you will need to figure out what‚Äôs right for you, but I wanted you to know that you‚Äôre not alone in questioning these things and that you deserve to feel good about yourself and to enjoy your body. Again, I'm sorry for the essay and feel free to reply or DM me if you'd like to discuss :)"	q8l2sd	NonBinary	21	0.93	2021-10-15 09:50:42
Nonbinary, gender fluid... I took the plunge (hrt- Testosterone) My experience so far. (x-post /r/genderqueer)	"So, I'm born female, struggled with my gender and sexual identity all my life until recently.

When I began dating the girl who I now know is my true love, she was so open and honest about her own experience with transition that it wasn't long before I tearfully admitted to her that I've always felt like my birth body didn't match up with how I wanted to be seen.

For a long time, I struggled with that big secret (""I want to be a boy""), and then- it was out. And then I realized, I had never considered what kind of boy I wanted to be, so in the safety of a few trusted friends and with my partner, I began to explore and give a voice to those long repressed feelings and desires. I began to read about non-binary trans identities and experiences, and to express myself in a way that was much more fluid and queer. I realized I always wanted to be someone whose identity was fluid, because cramming myself in a box on either side of the spectrum proved to be miserable in every way. I wanted to be androgynous. I wanted to move the slider over, so that no matter where on the spectrum I woke up, I could feel comfortable.

Finally, just last week, after months of consulting with my doctor, doing the bloodwork, and so on, he asked me if I would like to start my HRT that day. I balled up my fists and said... Yes. Why not? Let's do it. I only have one life to live, I want to start a low dose of T, and keep doing what was working so well for me- taking it a day at a time. Listening to myself. Seeking the support of community. And never trying to fit into a box again.

So far... well- psychologically the effects have been mindblowing. This last year, I've made great strides in taking care of my mental health for once, having never really done so. I stopped drinking. I'm far from better, but now I'm in a place where I don't feel like every step is a landmine. And within a day of that first injection... I felt so at peace. So unified. So calm.

The best way I've been able to describe it is this: I've always thought of this dysphoria and this deep hurt and feeling of not belonging as having two people trapped in the same body, one of which who never really got a chance to thrive. Think teenage angst times 11. But finally, I threw my boy side a bone. I acknowledged that he exists and that he's felt trapped and upset. But now he feels validated, he's stopped throwing temper tantrums. He's even admitted that he's not particularly interested in the culture of masculinity, he just wanted to be heard. I know it sounds silly.

But suddenly I feel so much more comfortable in my skin, long before any physical changes have happened. My partner said her psychological relief was almost instant when she began HRT as well, long before she experienced the physical changes. Now I understand it.

Currently, I am taking the HRT day by day. My plan is to continue with the half dose and just keep feeling it out. Do I want to fully transition? Do I want to continue on a low dose until I feel androgynous enough to stop? I'm not sure. I've already broken most of the ""rules"" and I've never felt more like my life was actually worth living, so I'll just keep living it, day by day.

I love you all and I just wanted to share- this community, among others here, helped me out more than I could ever say. If I hadn't secretly browsed /r/lgbt 4 years ago and wandered my way over to /r/genderqueer, I probably would have spent another decade drinking to blackout several times a week, resenting my cis partner and myself, cutting my skin and thinking about suicide constantly. That was me, a year ago. Now I am engaged in the gayest, queerest, genderless lesbian husband/wife relationship with the best friend I've ever had.

I won't pretend things aren't hard right now, but I think these are the times that the positive must shine through for an example- I never would have been brave enough if it wasn't for all the beautiful, visible queers shining like stars and giving my repressed, miserable self some hope, something to strive for.

Thank you all.

Thank you.
Thanks for sharing! I'm not on T yet but I related strongly to your post."	5djm95	NonBinary	17	0.92	2016-11-18 01:02:34
I finally figured out where I fit on the nb spectrum and it's demigender	"I've known I'm non-binary for a few years now but could never narrow down my identity. And honestly I didn't care because I didn't have a strong connection to a gender but I knew I wasn't agender.

But the other day I came across the term ""demigirl"", looked into that and things started to click. 

This is the definition of demigender that I resonate the most with:

>involves feeling a partial, but not a full, connection to the concept of gender

I don't care about my personal pronouns (just don't call me ""it""). I'm more masculine than feminine but have no desire to transition (AFAB). However I've often thought I would have fit in better if I was born AMAB. I don't plan on officially coming out to the non queer people in my life (at least not yet) because I don't want to have to explain non-binary or demigender to people. I'm perfectly fine with people assuming I'm a cis female in person, because ultimately I don't care what gender someone thinks I am.

It feels nice to finally type out all of these thoughts that have been swirling around in my head. Thanks for reading :)"	"Congratulations, that's so exciting! I'm happy for you. :D

Coming out non-binary to Mormon parents with a letter	"Well here we go. I'm a little nervous but thankfully I've been both out of their faith and materially independent from them for a decade now, and I don't have a lot of my ongoing self-worth tied up in what they think of me.  I don't expect much, but I want to give them a chance. And most importantly I want them to find out on my terms.



>Dear Mom and Dad,

>I have to explain something to you about myself, because it is very important to me and I am going through changes that have distinctly improved my life, happiness, and sense of self. ¬†¬†I know you care about and love me, and I want to be authentic and honest with you and all the other people I care most about. 

>For several years now I have been quietly questioning my identity and reflecting on the ways I view myself and how I would most like to interact with the world. ¬†I have come to the conclusion that I am gender non-binary, which means that I don't fit into fixed male/female definitions of gender. I also am transfeminine, meaning that although my personal sense of gender is not entirely female, overall my identity is more feminine than the male gender I was assigned to at birth.

>My gender does not inherently change anything about who I was or am, apart from the name, pronouns, and terms used to describe me and talk about me. In being honest and open about my gender I am not changing anything about who I am, but only trying to be more authentically myself in all my relationships. What clothes I choose to wear or how I present my body is an expression of fashion and personal taste and not an indication of my gender.

>This year I have started taking hormone replacement medication and this has done more good for me in a few months than any changes I have tried to make in the past several years. ¬†I feel much more in touch with myself and who I‚Äôm meant to be. And I have chosen a name for myself that better reflects who I am. However both of these parts of my transition have not changed who I am, because this is who I always was, even if no one could see it with their eyes.

>Here are things I need you to know: ¬†I do not feel comfortable being referred to by traditionally male pronouns (he/him/his/himself), but ask that others refer to me as they/them/their/themself. ¬†I also ask that you use gender neutral terms for me whenever applicable, such as ‚Äúchild‚Äù instead of ‚Äúson‚Äù and so on. If you‚Äôre unsure about what terms to use, you can ask me and I am happy to help. ¬†I understand that these changes for how to talk about me may be confusing at first and it will take some time to adjust, especially when it comes to my chosen name; but what matters most to me is the willingness and effort to learn and use them.

>I would love and appreciate your support, however I know what the LDS faith tells you about gender. ¬†I will neither go out of my way to persuade you of what you should believe nor will I argue with you about my validity. ¬†I am aware there are narratives your church has for how I ‚Äúbecame‚Äù this way; I unequivocally reject all of them. I sincerely hope that you will come to look past what others have told you your child should conform to so that you may see me as I truly am. Transitioning is not something I started lightly, nor is it something I was tricked or deceived into doing; it has taken me over four years to reach this point, and I have talked to multiple therapists and doctors about it. ¬†Again, this is not a matter for debate. I will not tolerate abusive behavior, bad faith, or contentiousness about my identity. I am not telling you what you have to believe, but I am telling you where my boundaries are. The choice to transgress those boundaries is yours alone. How I respond to breaches of my boundaries is mine.


>I know this all may sound strange and uncertain; it‚Äôs completely normal to experience strong emotions when a loved one transitions, but this is important and necessary to me. ¬†Therefore I ask that you take some time to carefully consider what I've written and how you would like to respond, and to first respond back via letter or email before we talk directly. ¬†I am not expecting this to be easy for either you or me. But if you are willing to act in good faith towards me, I am willing to hear what you have to say.

>[Chosen Name]"	"Having done this myself (enby child of mormon parents), good luck, this is terrifying stuff to deal with. My folks took it better than I had worried they might (though they still are ignorant and think of themselves as allies when they really aren't very supportive, but at least they didn't disown me), and hopefully yours will be the same. If they aren't, know that you are valid and that it's probably not that they don't love you, so much as that in their brainwashedness from the cult of mormonism they have decided that harming you is actually what they should do for you in trying to best love you. If it does go badly, I hope they learn the error of their ways and put family before faith, but no matter what happens you have to be you and if they aren't ready to accept and love you for you, sometimes they just have to be cut out of your life until such time as they are willing to do right by you. You have no responsibility to compromise yourself for them. 
I can't imagine anything more difficult. I go to a United Church of Christ church, where I am loved and welcomed, and affirmed.  If you choose to believe in God, the God I believe in is  ENBY and naturally ""they"" -  creator, savior, and spirit.

MTF. Hormones didn't provide answer I was looking for, anybody relate?	"AMAB. When I was pre - hrt, I was absolutely convinced that I'm binary trans woman. However my reaction to HRT lead me to believe otherwise.

I never had social dysphoria and I don't care whether you call me he/his or you expect me to be dominant. However, I do have a great deal of stress when something ""gendered"" in society comes up and people are for example being divided in groups of women and men.

Body-wise I never wished for penis. In fact genital dysphoria was, what prompted me the most to get into transition. I do still have quite a genital dysphoria, but other things are changing.

I was afraid before hrt that my breasts would be too small and that I have too bulky ""skeleton"" to ever pass as a female, now I realize that's not truth. HRT is making me smaller with every passing day and it seems that recently my breasts also took off and I don't know, but both of these changes make me kinda uncomfortable or ""stoic"" for that matter.

I feel like that binary trans woman would freak out that she is not feminine enough, while I'm here and in my mind it's like ""whatever I don't really care whether I will pass or not"" or ""I don't mind whether my transition takes 1 year or 3 years"". It's not like changes are coming too slowly (as is common complain between binary trans people), I just don't really care about them anymore.

Anybody relate, or at least do you have any idea what gender can I possibly be?"	"Unfortunately, no one can tell you that. I remember when I first became acutely aware that I was definitely not CIS. I wanted, more than anything, to know where that path would end. For a long time, I wasn't quite sure. I would have loved for someone to tell me what I was... whether that be my therapist, my then fiance or close friend. The uncertainty was... to put it mildly... awful.

But, the truth is, nobody can do that for you. This is your journey and only you can take it. The answer to your question lies only with you.

So, who do you think you \*are\* at core? What do you think would make you happiest? Who do you want to see in that mirror?

Best of luck on your journey... Give yourself time. The answers will come.
hang in there!! hrt is a confusing and tumultuous time for many. however, I will say this- there‚Äôs no wrong way to be a woman. You can be a woman and not be completely binary, or be a woman and have different experiences and feelings than other binary women, a gnc woman, etc. however, you could be nonbinary as well. as someone who is AFAB, i don‚Äôt have a lot of help when it comes to E or experiences of the other side of transitioning, but trying things out really helped me discover myself as a young NB person. Labels, names, ways people refer to me- i experimented a bit, and even though i‚Äôm still not completely sure how I want to transition, I‚Äôm mostly sure (like 98%) who I am gender wise and happy to be NB. as far as cis people go there‚Äôs no one way to be a woman or man, so The same goes for trans people. You dont have to have a strong desire to pass or have certain experiences to be a gender. You can just be, whatever that may be. good luck & hope you find peace!! 
I can totally relate to this. I've been on HRT since March, and while I expected that to make things clearer for me, I'm still confused about gender and what I want to do socially. All I know is I don't want to masculinize further and I don't want to deal with gendered divides, especially if I'm lumped into a 'male' group. So 'non-binary' works for me, for now. 

Also, I think taking things slowly can be good, even if it isn't for everyone. I'm trying to temper my expectations and treat this more like a marathon than a sprint. Some people know exactly what they want, and some people have the right circumstances to make that a reality ASAP. But that doesn't mean the rest of us are any less valid. One thing I've done recently is ask a few people to refer to me with they/them. It's not big, but it's still a step towards a better understanding of myself. That's what it's about, in the end.
I think that thinking of gender as a black and white system is toxic. It's toxic for people who participate in it as cisgender ( I'm not man enough unless I... or I have to look a certain way to be beautiful and my value as a person is attached to my beauty...) It's toxic for people who transition (see aforementioned parenthetical bits), and it's toxic for nonbinary folk ( you have to be this or that; what's in your pants; you can't be ...; you're (insert sexuality as an insult here); etc).

Maybe you should just give yourself a break from making yourself fit the binary and just be you, whoever that is. :-)
I can relate to this, as someone who took T and realised they didn't like the changes. I ended up feeling uninterested in most of the major physical changes, didn't care how long it took either, in fact I was hoping it wouldn't take long at all! Which is why I removed myself from T. Right now I'm in the midst of figuring out if I'm non-binary, or a GNC cisgender woman. I very much dislike the divide between genders. There is no need for it really. Sure, our bodies may be different physically in one or more ways, but that doesn't mean people should be treated any more or less. 

When I was pre-T, I convinced myself of being a binary trans male because it was the only thing that made sense in my head at the time. I wanted an easy route, either from being scared of identifying as anything other than binary or dealing with confidence /social issues related to my assigned gender. I'm still determining which one that is. 

I worried that my voice wouldn't fully drop yet didn't want my body to change drastically. It changed drastically, even for someone who only took T for 3 months. My voice began to drop and I should have been ecstatic, but I wasn't. I was uncomfortable. It was terrible. To be honest I shouldn't have been taking hormones in the first place as it's impossible to know what changes are going to happen and to what extent. Something definitely drove me to that choice, sheer stupidity or the need for answers. 

I wish I knew how to tell exactly what is going on with you genderwise - that way you can know exactly who you are, know what to do in order to live a comfortable and happy life, and no longer have to deal with the stresses of figuring yourself out. Wherever your journey takes you, I hope you end up in a place where you feel at ease. However long it takes, I have faith that someday you'll know just who you are on the inside and can focus on nothing but experiencing your life to the fullest. Take care of yourself.

Some less-than-sober thoughts	"First off, y'all are valid as hell and I love every single one of you. Even if we wouldn't mesh irl, just knowing y'all are out there being you is great and makes me happy. Extra credit if you're doing so unapologetically but I get it too if that ain't where you're at rn. I'm super apologetic about who I am out in public fr

Second, I get that people say that it's never too late to transition and that you don't owe anybody androgyny or whatever. Logically that makes sense and I'd like all of you to take that advice to heart. I have to be real tho and admit that it's hard sometimes. I'm living in a red area of a purple state, working with some serious stakes professionally, still trying to finish up my degree, and experiencing some real dysphoria presenting as my agab every day to keep the peace. I wish this shit wasn't so stigmatized ya know

That being said, I'm a bit tipsy rn and just wanted to let y'all know a few things.

1) you're amazing. Maybe not all the time but nobody is perfect so whatever level your confidence is at rn, you up that shit real fast
2) I'm paranoid that one of my type A conservative bosses or committee members will find my reddit and I don't care right now. If you're one of them and you're reading this then hello but however much Mike's Harder I drink while I'm off the clock is none of your business, just like what's in my pants isn't either
3) I'm not a woman. I'm not a man. Maybe I'm a man, IDK and right now IDC.
4) Hi everyone. My name that I call myself in my head is Nils. My middle name can screw off (but I would like to figure that out soonish if at all possible.... Aelger? Alexxi? IDK). My last name might connect me to some real assholes but it also connects me to some world-changing people so it can stay.

I'm shouting to the void rn but if anyone (who isn't my bosses) is reading this then you keep being you. Thank you for reading the tired and buzzed ramblings of this nerd right here. You're super valid"	"Yo, it's me, the void:

You're amazing as well. Keep true to yourself and stay strong üíú
What up, Nils! I hope the day you can openly be who you are is fast approaching üíú
You seem pretty cool Nils! Wishing you all the best, and that you get to a time/place where you can safely be unapologetically you!"	yxcoi8	NonBinary	18	1.0	2022-11-17 01:32:43
Gender burnout	"I hope it's okay to post this on an alt/throwaway account.

I'm burned out. Completely wiped. 

I came out as non-binary six or seven years ago and in the last year had top surgery and started low-ish dose testosterone. While that's given me a lot of euphoria, it's also causing a lot of stress and extra gender burnout/exhaustion (on top of autism & ADHD burnout). It feels even more dysphoric now to be misgendered. I just had to call my bank (which I hate doing because that's an automatic misgender) and I corrected the person when they asked me a question in a gendered manner. The response: ""I was just asking a question."" No, you weren't. You made an assumption and now you don't want to be corrected. I ended up ending the call before I got my problem resolved, said I'd call back another time. I couldn't hold the tears in anymore and needed to hang up quickly.

I don't know where my resiliency with getting misgendered went. I avoid making important calls or going to appointments because I just don't want to deal with it. I get too upset now and it can ruin not just that day, but days after. I don't have the cup filled like I used to. I'm so tired of having my life revolve around my gender, educating others, transitioning, all of it. I often wish that I was cis so I simply could not think about it or even care, you know? 

I don't have much of a support system (I live in a new city and haven't connected with the local queer community, plus with covid there hasn't been anything happening yet) and my partner is cis (tries so much to support me but doesn't always understand). My therapist is cishet and while she's done some training around supporting trans/queer folks, it just doesn't quite always land between us when we talk about gender. Sometimes I feel like I have to give a lot of context to what I'm talking about so she better understands, and it takes me out of being present with what I'd like to discuss in a session. I'm on a waiting list for a trans therapist but it's very long.

I don't have much of a point with this post I suppose, I just really needed to talk to someone and don't have someone to talk to about this kind of stuff. I'm tired. I'm really, really tired. My burnout started when I left a job four years ago due to a lot of transphobia and degrading behaviour and I never really recovered... I guess I never really knew how or had the right supports in place to get me there. I've kind of pretended it hasn't been bothering me but it pops up in ways like crying after getting misgendered once by a person I'll never speak to again. 

If you've experienced burnout, I'd love to hear your experiences, if you're comfortable sharing. Thanks for sitting with me for this rant."	"Yes. It's definitely real. I used to be able to handle getting misgendered just fine. Now I can actually tear up because of it. I think it's because of becoming less numb to dysphoria, that when we feel it again it's much worse.
Hi. Yeah. Being continuously *aware* is so hard. I have a teaching job in a field that basically invites people to misgender me; I have a young child and the idea of a genderless parent breaks people's minds so they are forever picking a gender for me (or the doctors asking ""but actually are you..."" as if it matters so much what our genetic relationship is); the changes from HRT seem in one moment so obvious to me and the next invisible... it's hard. Being cis certainly does seem so easy and free. Something as simple as letting my body be the way it's inclined to be... Even being binary trans seems like an attractive option: at least then cis people would *understand*, and most of them where I live would probably honestly feel bad about misgendering me, instead of this nebulous state of tolerance I get (at best) from the vast majority of cis people.

At this point I honestly have alternative personas I offer up to service industry folks and the like some days. My one job involves tabling at a library and I picked a definitively binary-associated name for my badge and that's my name in that role because I just Could. Not. Handle anyone else deliberately mishearing the actual name I use to be more ""binary"" than it is. Or somehow the pizza place has me listed by a completely different name, and I just say yes and use that. And at my other job where on days I show up in clothes dubbed sufficiently femme the temp workers all do the ma'am/sister/girl-power thing whereas otherwise they ignore me? I don't even know, it's probably honestly straight-up dissociation that gets me through those interactions.
Yes, it‚Äôs very real. I haven‚Äôt been authentic to myself until last year and it is so hard. So I imagine 6-7 years of that is absolutely exhausting. It sounds like your protective factors  aren‚Äôt there. It‚Äôs important to build your support network especially since you‚Äôve had a lot of big transitions (e.g., physically, mentally, geographically, etc.). You need people around you who understand you. If you‚Äôre in a city, there should be some support network somewhere. If you have a difficult time finding it, then your therapist absolutely should have knowledge of that. If they do not, they can network with other trans therapists to help support you better.
I completely feel you. I feel like the more out and the more I get to be where I want to be, the more people not seeing me and/or disregarding me hurts me. I feel like I am trying to hard sometimes and I don‚Äôt always have the energy for that.

What has helped me is I found a trans support group. It helped me make trans (or really any) friends and helped me feel less alone in my struggles. Some support groups are free through lgbtq centers- mine cost money but is only 8 ppl and I found through googling and looking into therapy centers in the area.
I really relate to this. The more I explore my identity as a genderfluid / non-binary person the more I am bothered when people misgender me. I am AMAB and I used to be okay with the occasional ‚Äòdude‚Äô and I am even finding that triggering now. Part of me feels sometimes like, is this even worth it? Has all this awareness just made things worse for me?"	t6ua6x	NonBinary	19	1.0	2022-03-04 22:08:19
Coming out at work as a non-binary professional on hormones	"Hi,  I've been struggling with how to come out at work as a non-binary person in a professional field that is liberal but very normative (academic biomedical research). 

I really struggle with discomfort over people witnessing my gender as ""transitioning"" as I have always been internally non-binary but haven't presented outside the binary until the last year. These are colleagues who have known me for 10 years as one gender, and I'm asking them to recognize that is different and also not the standard binary transition.  I  don't think trying to explain non-binary identity will be received well because it's not something that can be summed up quickly.  Also, discussion of identity issues are often seen as juvenile and decreases your perceived professionalism. 

I've been on T for a year and really I feel I need to address the physical changes at work (even though I only pass about half the time, my voice passes on the phone most of the time). I've also changed my name legally, but intend to keep my old slightly unisex name  professionally.  But I don't really care about pronouns too much at work. 

I don't know how to broach this at work, just that I have to soon. My HR actually has resource guides for bosses and employees who are transitioning, but they are very binary and kind of proscriptive (i.e. You should tell everyone before undergoing medical treatment, yeah right). I don't think they are a useful resource.  

Any thoughts or practical ideas on how to do this?"	"When I came out, I wrote a letter (email) for all. It basically it said ""I'm transgender, non-binary (paragraph of explanation of non-binary, and my type of non-binary)(links to further explanations online, including sciency ones). While I've always been this way, I've come to a place in my life where I'm finally ready and able to transition my body to match the way I am inside. I'm still the same person you know, and while you may be seeing some changes, you're just seeing the true me on the outside for the first time.""

The way I sum up non-binary is ""the shades of gray between black and white, like you have people who are straight, homosexual, bisexual, and asexual,""  which people generally understand. Especially in biology, they should get it, since there is such a mix of physical genetic traits in males and females that cross over and blend. Like women who never really grow boob, men with moob, women with wide shoulders, men with narrow shoulders, men with small hands, women with big hands, etc. Except it's in the brain, instead of the body.
I'm a non-binary public librarian and I came out at work a few months ago, after about 6 months on T and after top surgery.  Here's the all-staff email I had my supervisor send out, along with a couple of factsheets from the National Center for Transgender Equality defining terms and explaining things at a 101 level (and also implicitly asserting that this is a Real Thing and not just me being a millennial).

""...those of you who have seen me lately may have noticed some changes in my voice and appearance over the last year. That‚Äôs because I‚Äôm transgender* and non-binary*, and I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to be able to start a medical transition. I‚Äôm really excited to tell you that I‚Äôm changing my name to Morgan. I still want to be referred to with they/them pronouns (e.g. ‚Äì ‚ÄúThis is Morgan; they‚Äôre a public services librarian. They can help you find what you‚Äôre looking for‚Äù). If that‚Äôs hard for you, or if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable correcting people, you can just say my name a lot in lieu of pronouns. Any questions you have regarding my name, appearance, or identities are likely to be easily answered with a quick google search, and are probably inappropriate for a work environment. I trust you all to use common sense in respecting my professional and personal boundaries.

My old work email will redirect to [newaddress], and I‚Äôd appreciate it if you could update your contacts.""

--
My boss sent this along with a postscript reminding staff of our nondiscrimination policy (which does not actually cover gender identity or expression but neither she nor they seem to understand that and I'm not going to argue). I have had zero negative feedback and everyone has been very professional about the whole thing.
Do you have an HR rep? You could explain the situation to them. 

I completely understand not wanting to declare personal information in a professional setting. But you can keep it professional and non-emotional if you decide to email blast. 

Something like, ""Just a heads-up that I'm trans (non-binary). My name is [name] and pronouns are [abc]. Thanks for understanding.""
this is helpful! thank you :)
Thanks for the suggested short, basic  email approach. That sounds really good for me, because I don't really want to delve into emotion or personal explanations. I want to let people know what's up in case the wondering about the physical changes, but I personally  don't  feel comfortable writing  ""in case you've noticed changes, I have always been non-binary but now have had the chance to embody that"". It would be great if I was, but I'd really rather keep it to impersonal data they need to infer what's going on. 

I might add ""Happy to talk further in person"". That way people can engage with it or not to whatever degree they want. "	72tcv3	NonBinary	15	0.74	2017-09-27 16:18:44
F*ck school honestly	"You know how teachers like to check attendance every lesson? We have a digital list for that. You‚Äôd think it makes it easier bc you can just delete the students that leave throughout the year and also change the names when there has been a mistake initially. Or when someone changes their name. Nope. This is still Germany, famously incompetent when it comes to digitalization.

Every day I (agender person with a chosen name) have to remind my teachers that the name they have if their list is not mine and I don‚Äôt identify with it nor can I accept their ignorance. Actually, I‚Äôm afraid they think it‚Äôs a phase or something. They just don‚Äôt understand. Or they don‚Äôt want to and deem it too unimportant to actually change my name in the system.

So yesterday I went to the secretary‚Äôs office and told her I wanted my name changed. She asked why. For a second I thought about explaining it all to her (again! I was there before) but then decided to go the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù way.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because I‚Äôm trans‚Äù

What can I say? It worked like a charm. Apparently they care about trans people now. It feels like they are somewhat afraid of making mistakes but not enough to actually do some research. I felt uncomfortable to say it like that because I don‚Äôt actually identify as trans and it feels like I‚Äôm putting a false perspective on for other trans people. I have no intention of transitioning. Yes, my body doesn‚Äôt match my gender but no body ever will. I‚Äôm ok with that. I know my body doesn‚Äôt really resemble my gender and it doesn‚Äôt have to. I make the best of it, honestly. I just don‚Äôt know if I will have to explain more now. I guess school just sucks like that. Educators not being interested in educating themselves."	"Technically trans is defined by ""not your assigned gender at birth"" so any non-binary, agender, genderfluid,.... all of those could use the label trans. Since not every binary trans person can or wants to full transition, we shouldn't define the label this way. As I'm agender it took me some time to feel comftable with the label trans, since I learned trans=transition too. See it that way: trans is the umbrella for non-binary people, so when cis people cannot compute what non-binary means, then we can use trans because they might have heared about it (in Germany at least).

Gymnasium was horror for me, and I also noticed the thing that a lot of my teachers were not willing to learn something new, which is both ironic and sad. At least one English teacher genuinely didn't know they can use 'they' for an (unknown) singular person. I was the only """"girl"""" in a class and we were supposed to write about another persons holiday. The other people should guess which person. And boom, the smarter kids used ungendered language. Yeah and as I said the teacher was confused... ü§¶
You don't have to ID as trans, but you absolutely do count if you want to. You don't have to transition to be trans, just have a gender (or lack thereof) that doesn't match your AGAB. And you're not doing anything at all to harm or misrepresent trans people either. This is a common trans issue to have to struggle to get your name respected and updated on like rosters and stuff. You're doing what any other trans person (who is comfortable standing up for themselves and correcting people) would do. You're fine."	udnxj8	NonBinary	16	0.9	2022-04-28 05:42:01
How to come out at 47?	"This is a tough question but what I am wondering is if it might be possible for me to ""come out"" and be accepted as trans or non-binary (in trans/non-binary spaces) even though I don't want to transition medically, cut my hair, or change my pronouns (currently use she/they).  There is so much more to this so please read on before responding.  

I hope this does not come off wrong.  I have so much respect for trans and nonbinary folks.  I feel that this community is where I belong.  I have felt excluded, isolated, and misunderstood my whole life.  When I was a child I wanted desperately to be a boy.  My best friends were boys, I wrote stories from a male point of view, and I even did curls and pushups to build my upper body.  When I hit puberty (in a small midwestern town in the 80's, BTW) I didn't experience a ton of dysphoria, because not too much changed.  I have very small breasts, straight hips, and muscular arms and shoulders.  I was basically Juno, but in the 90's.  Same attitude, and very unfortunately, a similarly ""feminine"" face.  My face is what has always caused me the most trouble.  In particular my itty-bitty, teeny-tiny ""adorable"" 'lil button nose!  It's bad, for real.  And no amount of T is going to fix that.  (And, as tempting as the other physical effects might be- I've had lifelong struggles with sleep and I hear that it commonly makes these worse).

So anyway, I've dealt with a lifetime of ""big reactions"" to the words I choose and just my general way of being (confident, direct, concise, unapologetic) because it doesn't ""match"" the face it goes with.  At this point in my life I am so, so sick of those reactions.  And it still pisses me off beyond all description of words to think that I should have to modify my appearance to accommodate other people's reactions.  I'm fine with the way I look.  Sure I don't actively like it, but it just isn't a big deal to me.  I don't sit there and stare in the mirror every day.  I have long hair that is super fine, thin, and has a major cowlick that would stick straight up in the back if it was short.  There is also the fact that I hate spending time on my appearance and if I had short hair it would require so much more effort.  I mostly wear masculine clothes but it's like that doesn't register with people due to the femininity of my face and hair.

The thing with the lifetime of ""big reactions"" that I have had to suffer through is that the cumulative effect of this has worn my tolerance down to the point where I just don't give a fuck what other people think of me.  A lot of people view me as a ""bad"" or ""wrong"" woman and that's just fine.  They can think what they want.  If I ask everyone to use they/them pronouns, to me that feels like asking for respect from people who aren't capable of giving it, and doing so just adds exponential stress.  I don't want assholes who are internally mocking me to have ""they"" on their tongue when speaking about me.  To me that is far more offensive than ""she"".  For what it's worth, when I hear ""they"" from other trans/ENBYs, it brings me joy.  But I have suffered so much already (I'm 47), I just feel I should get a pass on doing the (appreciated, respected, valuable) work of asking others to modify their language.  Is this BS?  Am I being ""weak"" by staying with she/they?  Because from where I sit, the amount of pain I have endured as a result of other's gendered perception of me kind of makes me feel like I deserve a purple heart. 

I'm guessing I will fit in more in non-binary spaces than trans spaces but I'm curious to hear what you all think.  I would really like to find some community and acceptance, but the fear of rejection is pretty strong and has kept me away thus far.  

As far as ""coming out"" I have no idea how to do that.  I've (long ago) told my family and everyone that is close to me that I am queer and genderqueer, but for me, pronouns just aren't a big deal.  I honestly just don't care and it makes me feel deeply uncomfortable to think of them stumbling over themselves trying to use language to accommodate a way that they don't actually see me.  I just want to add in some new friends who do see me accurately, if that makes sense.  I don't use social media so I can't ""come out"" there.  I'm starting to feel like my mental health is at a tipping point due to the lack of community on this topic.  Appreciate any and all thoughts from kindhearted folks.  Thank you for reading."	"Congratulations. You have come out. Just by saying you're nonbinary. It is that simple. 

I get a lot of what you're saying because I'm also older though my experience has been a little different. I am choosing to make some medical, physical, and pronoun changes myself. But no one owes anyone that. It's just because it makes me feel better about myself. And you might find that becomes the case for you too, or maybe not. 

When I first realized there was a word for how I felt inside I didn't really intend to *do* anything about it except tell my friends. But then I noticed it got more and more upsetting to be misgendered, so I started to tell more people. And I have found the more I do that the better I feel. But that's just for *me*. There's people I have no desire to be out too so I'm not. I wouldn't lie if asked but I'm not gonna say anything or correct my pronouns with them. There are probably some people that don't like that but here's the thing... that's a *them* problem.
You've come out just by posting this so congrats! If it helps I identify as nonbinary (I'm afab) and still present in a feminine way, just because it's what suits my body. I don't care how people see me. People automatically use she/her pronouns and even though I'd much prefer they/them it doesn't bother me massively although I do feel a bit irked by it sometimes. You're valid no matter how you present and what pronouns you use, you'll always have an accepting community in nb spaces :)
‚Äú As far as ""coming out"" I have no idea how to do that. I've (long ago) told my family and everyone that is close to me that I am queer and genderqueer,‚Äù 

Sounds like you have already come out, and as other posters have said, your post is another coming out.   


Technically I think I have come out to different groups of real life folks at least 4 times. First was just to my partner when I was 49, followed by parents and siblings a few months later. Came out to a few friends when I was 50, and to work this year.   


We don‚Äôt have to change our pronouns, the way we dress or our names to be nonbinary. Some people do, some don‚Äôt and everyone is valid.   


Welcome to the family.
So happy to see you here! Like the others have said, this is you coming out, and so hooray, yay!!

I‚Äôm (quick glance at the calendar) 42, and I recognize a lot of the feelings you are sharing. So many years of people acting like I‚Äôm being a girl/woman wrong, which is an absurd notion in any case, but which has left some scars and some not-wanting-to-trust some folks. I think coming out isn‚Äôt necessarily a one-time thing, and it‚Äôs super duper fine if we decide how much of ourselves we want to share with any given person. Not everyone is worthy of our trust. You are valid and welcome in nonbinary spaces no matter how many people you are out to, and no matter what pronouns you go with. 

I‚Äôm pretty officially out in that I‚Äôve had my pronouns as they/them in the largest national English language paper where I live, and yet, no one much seems to have noticed, lol. (The community language where I live doesn‚Äôt use third person pronouns much at all, so it‚Äôs a bit of a moot point day to day) But in recent years I‚Äôve been making more of an effort to find more inclusive spaces, and that‚Äôs been wonderful (also painful in that I‚Äôve decided to leave some unsupportive spaces, but a healthy sort of pain I think); I have some friends now who I know are in my corner instead of feeling like people who like me might only like one part of me. And some people in my life have always seen me for me and continue to do that regardless, and words don‚Äôt really enter into it all. We‚Äôve all got to find our way through in the way that works best for us!
Yes, you‚Äôll be welcome in trans and nonbinary spaces. I know a number of trans and nonbinary folks who didn‚Äôt come out until their 50s or even 60s. It‚Äôs never too late. 

Go into it with an open and humble attitude. I‚Äôve seen a few older people who struggle in trans spaces because they have very rigid views about respectability, age, proper language, etc. But I also have seen plenty of older people thrive in trans spaces because they are capable of getting along with younger people, even when there may be differences in opinion or experiences. 

There‚Äôs plenty of other stuff in your post that I could write paragraphs about. But I‚Äôll keep it short and hope you don‚Äôt take it personally:

* You can just ‚Äútry out‚Äù HRT. If you‚Äôre worried about the effects of T on your sleep, just take it for a week or two and stop taking it if it‚Äôs really as bad as you think. Sleep problems are really not *that* common with HRT. 

* Short hair is actually super fucking easy to deal with. No need to brush it or even use conditioner. Get some high-hold matte hair cream and you can fix even the worst cowlick in 30 seconds. 

* If changing your body or appearance would make you slightly happier, just do it. You don‚Äôt need to have crippling dysphoria or hate your body to make a change. 

* If you really ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give a fuck‚Äù what people think, then why does it cause you so much stress just imagining silent reactions to using a different pronoun? If you‚Äôre a confident and unapologetic person then why are you so worried about rejection?

* Do not **ever** feel obligated to identify a certain way, use a certain label, use a pronoun, etc. Nonbinary people don‚Äôt use ‚Äúthey‚Äù because we feel obligated to progress society or some dumb shit like that. The only reason to change your pronouns is if hearing those pronouns makes you happy. It‚Äôs totally ok to use different names or pronouns or labels in different scenarios. Whether that‚Äôs for your own comfort, your safety, or because you‚Äôre just too exhausted to bother correcting someone. 

* It‚Äôs also totally ok to just not give a fuck about pronouns. It‚Äôs not even that rare for nonbinary folks. Meet a dozen nonbinary or genderqueer folks and you‚Äôll very quickly run into someone who‚Äôs pronouns are ‚Äúany pronouns‚Äù or ‚Äúwhatever you want‚Äù. 

* There‚Äôs no right or wrong way to come out. There‚Äôs no obligation to come out to any person or group. I know someone who has been on HRT for years, had gender-affirming surgeries, and came out to all their family members. But they still present as cis at work and in some of their hobbies. This person has been accepted in the local trans community for *years*. There‚Äôs no moral imperative to ‚Äúcome out publicly‚Äù.
Welcome to the fam, though you've been with us all along really :)

Also 40+, Any pronouns, I'm out at work, with friends, kinda with family (I made a post about it and left it at that really). I tend not to rock the boat, but my work does involve behavioral psychology, so here's some things I know; 

If you only tell them once, it's not gonna make much of a difference (marketing uses a ""rule of 7"" for people to pay attention to a message). 

If you have a conversation and explain your perspective, especially if there's mutual respect, I usually get a ""yeah okay, that makes sense"" response, and that increases the chance of pronoun change. I have a few core friends that use they and a couple people at work; everyone else I know either defaults to agab pronouns or avoids their use (the latter is what we do if I'm in any official announcement)

The more people use new pronouns the more likely it is to stick due to social pressure and vice versa. Starting with a small core group and expanding out from there is effective because it's gradual change and you still have a core to rely on.

If other's comments become unbearable (or you want to establish your new rules), set boundaries. Tell them what you do and don't want them to do and what repercussions happen (like ""if you use she, I will ask you who you're talking about and correct you""). They might have boundaries they want to negotiate too. By your post above, it seems like this is something that could be a strength for you :) (btw, my favorite is when someone's like ""well you know how it is for us X"" and I'm like ""well, good thing I don't have to worry about that anymore! I quit!"" XD )

*

I will say even when attempting not to look like my agab folks assume it anyway. Coming out isn't a one and done; especially for us folks that are perceived one way or another, it's a continual process. That doesn't mean you have to do it all the time though, you get to decide how much energy you want to invest in it.
Hiya! Come in, glad to have you with us, friend :) 

RE long hair: If you're worried about maintenance, go shorter. There is nothing easier to deal with day to day than a buzz cut üòÖ Anything under 10mm, so the hairs aren't long enough to bend under their own weight. It towels dry in a flash, never gets in your way, it definitely doesn't look super fem. And you can wear crazy wigs if you want to have long hair for a change.
Based on my experience I don't think you should have trouble at IRL gatherings of trans & non-binary people. I'm 45 now, and before I started HRT, before I even came out publicly, I was accepted at support groups, still presenting like a plain old cis person.
I didn't figure myself out until 40 during the pandemic, and if you're already calling yourself genderqueer you're already there! the terms weren't even there when we were younger, you know? it's never too late to be who you are!
I want to underline this answer :) Was just about to write something similar. 
I'm also older came out 15 years ago and started transitioning now. It gives me so much joy and euphoria and I wish someone would have told me before how much better my state of mind can be. Back then trans people just told me that they accept me as I am. Well, that's for sure so."	12ec8k0	NonBinary	16	0.95	2023-04-07 06:31:37
I just need to vent about a post on another sub about they/them pronouns	"For reference, I use they/them pronouns.

Someone posted on a popular sub asking, ""How do I stop getting angry when people have they/them pronouns?"" (I'm paraphrasing but that was basically it). It was the shittiest disguise for a transphobic rant I've ever seen. OP was claiming that they ""know it's bad"" to be essentially repulsed by people who use they/them, but that to them it's ""like a cat puking"" and they just can't help but feel disgusted.

I wanted so badly to comment and tell them that nobody believed their half-assed claims of ""wanting to be better"", and if they really wanted to do any good they could go live on top of Mt. Everest so no one would ever have to be exposed to their toxic BS again. But I'm really not in a place where I want to open myself up to trolls.

It just felt so incredibly dehumanizing to see someone whining pitifully about how hard it is to exist in the same world as someone like me. I know I shouldn't care, and I don't, in the sense that I don't place any value or credibility in their way of thinking... But it bums me out so much to be reminded that people like that exist. It sucks to be reminded that I'm often unwanted and unsafe just walking out my front door. Now that my medical transition is under way and my transness becomes more and more visible, I'm growing more and more afraid to just... Exist. Because people like OP are out there, thinking that their comfort is more important than someone else's right to just fucking exist. I hate it."	"Sometimes (not a lot, but sometimes) these people do want to fix the specific thing they're posting about, but it's like... friend, buddy, how do I explain to you without you flouncing or throwing your toys out of the pram, that the problem you need to fix isn't being angry when people use specific pronouns. The problem you need to fix is your general lack of humanity and decency.

It's a fixable problem but these folks don't want to hear that that's the issue lol.
i feel most of the people i encounter will propose it as a gen question and then insult the topic only to complain about being bashed on for a question
Right, the rest of the population doesn't try to take away people's rights when we get angry :/

There's a time and place for people who honestly want to be more supportive but struggle with feelings of disgust and anger. I just wish it wasn't all the time and always made our problem to deal with. In a better world, that place would be with a therapist or privately with your personal circle, but the people who post these things also lack the basic consideration of others to see that.
I've seen posts like that, yeah, and always kinda hope that folks' words do manage to get through to them eventually, even if it's not right then because they're still enjoying the feeling of indignant martyrdom too much.
Yeah, I realize I probably came across a little harsh in my assessment of it obviously being an excuse. I was still pretty steamed. I know some people do actually want to work on it, but based on the OP's responses in the comments they were not really there yet. People were giving thorough and well thought out responses about confronting internal biases, and OP's answers were generally along the lines of, ""Ikik, but like... It's so *eww*. I know I shouldn't think they're gross but I just do, ugh."""	tgi9nv	NonBinary	18	0.92	2022-03-17 19:34:54
I'm scared	"I guess I just have to get it out. Sorry for my bad English, it's not my native language.

So I have been in therapy for the past year and it seems that I'm transgender. It shouldn't be that big of a surprise, since I acted and felt like a boy until puberty and once my breasts started growing I got really depressed up to the point where I tried to kill myself. The Internet always seemed to have answers to all my questions and I started to believe I'm non binary and my therapist thinks I might belong on the non-binary spectrum too. I just don't want to be a woman. I don't care about anything else. The thing is... I'm so unbelievably scared of transitioning, of humiliation, of not being accepted for who I am, of coming out to the public. I am a petite person, I'll never pass as a man. My dream career is being a professor and I live in a kinda conservative country. So I'm afraid of being discriminated against. Being a transman isn't as taboo as being somewhere in the middle. Everything hurts so much, I don't know who I am, I don't know who I am allowed to be. I just wish I wouldn't have to cry myself to sleep every night anymore. Please. Isn't there a cure out there somewhere? Is there somewhere who used to feel similar and can tell me their secret of being a happier person now? "	"I can‚Äôt answer your questions, unfortunately, but I wanted to comment on some stuff in your post. I‚Äôm in the same boat... anyway, you mentioned wanting to be a professor but that you live in a conservative country. I just wanted to say that universities tend to be more liberal than the country as a whole. Plus, being nonbinary (or trans in general) is becoming more and more accepted. So when you‚Äôve reached your goal, it‚Äôs hopefully not a big deal and as accepted as being binary trans. Also, you could check with the uni if they have any rules against discrimination based on gender identity. A lot of unis have their own documents so even if your country hasn‚Äôt made it a crime to discriminate against anyone based on gender identity, the uni might have it‚Äôs own rules against discrimination. 


One thing I‚Äôm personally working on is my self-esteem. I‚Äôm confident that I can do a lot of stuff, but I don‚Äôt give myself enough love and I always worry about what others will think about me. I know that I could become a professor (I used to want that but changed my mind) or get basically any job i want. But I do worry about what my future collegues will think about me being trans, to the point where I feel worthless and get crippling depression and anxiety. I have good self-confidence but terrible self-esteem. But you know what? My value isn‚Äôt based on what others think of me. If they don‚Äôt understand my gender identity, it doesn‚Äôt invalidate me. I‚Äôm still the same person and I would still make a damn good professor. (Now, I just need to get that to stick - I started doing self-esteem exercises yesterday so I haven‚Äôt seen any real difference yet, lol. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs easier in theory than reality). Anyway, the point is that I think you could benefit from some more self-esteem as well. 
I would ask yourself some questions to clarify what you're really longing for here. Do you want to live as a man but feel you can't? Do you want to be inbetween because it's safer or because it's what you really want? If your country were accepting, what would you ideally do?

I know it hurts a lot, and I'm sorry. 
Thank you for your reply! Yeah, my self-esteem is a huge issue for me. People often assume I'm arrogant and totally confident, but inside I'm a hot mess. Those issues probably stem from some experiences I made in school, I don't know if it's connected to my gender. I wish I could just rock a non-binary look and be myself like others on this sub do, but I'm afraid I can't and won't ever be able to.

About the university policy thing I'm not so sure. In my country being mentally ill can prevent you from getting a job in university or pretty much anywhere where you work for the government/state. I wanted to ask my mentor/professor about that, but I'm so afraid of coming out. I know he'll probably be understanding, he himself is gay and didn't always have it easy. But I wouldn't even know how to start that conversation. I work for him and we talk frequently, but I'll transfer to another university for a year and won't see him in that time. So I have pretty much less an a week left to have this conversation with him :/
Thank you. I want to live as gender neutral/androgynous as possible, I despise being a woman. If I were a man I wouldn't have as many problems with my identity, as long as I could present myself androgynously. With a woman's body it's hard for me, because binding hurts and restricts breathing and I have a long walk to work. If I were a man I'd experience hair loss, which would make me feel dysphoric as well. So if my country was accepting or even had something like a third gender/gender neutral pronouns I'd prefer living as non-binary. But if I wanted to transition in my country I'd have to get hormones as first step which I don't want to, so my insurance isn't going to pay for anything else. Sorry if I'm rambling, I had a few very tough days and it's hard to get my thoughts in order"	9ha8oc	NonBinary	16	0.95	2018-09-19 23:35:54
"I am extremely confused, at the core of everything I cannot figure out for myself what is the difference between ""I hate being a woman and wish I wasn't one"" and ""my gender identity is something-other-than-woman"". Would appreciate any input!"	"Hi, my situation is that I am interested in low-dose T, but extremely confused about to what end I want it for. I don't have any close friends who are trans, and talking to my partner made me even more confused. I have been spiraling and spiraling recently and can't think about anything else.

Below I describe in a lot of detail where I am coming from, but **the tl;dr is:** *what is the difference in your experience between ""I hate being a woman because of all the things people think being a woman means and want to escape that"" and ""I identify as not-a-woman""?*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Usually a few times a year, I experience days where I utterly loath my body and wish strongly that I had a different one, either androgynous or masculine. This started when I was in 7th grade, when everyone went through puberty, and I could not stand what my body turned into. Especially the growth of my breasts. All I wore for years was super baggy tshirts and oversized fleeces, and bore nonstop vitriol from my mother about not dressing correctly, and was so delighted when anyone thought I was a boy upon first encounter. All I wanted was to look like what the boys around me had suddenly grown into, I felt like they had left me behind. A lot of it was tied to my upbringing, fairly strict Asian gender roles.

Sometime in high school, I felt that I more or less grew to accept that this body is the hand I was dealt. And then partway through university, I started to sometimes like what I saw in the mirror. Since I graduated, I have thought about it less and less, but still regularly have days where I know if I don't completely shut the thoughts down right away, they would spiral into an obsession. I never knew about the concept of being trans until late high school, and didn't know about non-binarity until university. My feelings now center much more around how others perceive me and how I go through the world as a woman, I rarely have body dysmorphia anymore.

A few days after I turned 23, I bought a binder, because it marked about 10 years since I started feeling the way I do. It came in the mail a few weeks ago, and I have worn it a few times since.

I was devastated by it - it didn't do anything at all; it flattens my chest a bit, but I look the same. I don't know what I expected, this all is something I rarely let myself think or talk about, and getting a binder felt like such a huge deal to me, and it just. It's just a really tight sports bra. It didn't change anything.

&#x200B;

A few nights ago I had a bit of a weepy breakdown talking to a friend about this, who asked if I had ever considered taking T. I had gone on internet dives of looking at people's documentations of their FTM transitions, but I had never considered it for myself, because I don't identify as a man. I also thought I would never pass as anything but what I 'am' - very feminine looking Asian, 5 foot nothing, really curvy for my height, and really round and soft features.

After the thought was in my head though, I just couldn't stop thinking about it. I have also recently followed some people on social media who are genderqueer and present purposefully ambiguously, which I hadn't realized people could do. I live in NYC and I found out that it's comparatively accessible to get on T through Planned Parenthood here. I started looking into booking an appointment, but was still unsure.

I had a conversation with my partner last night where I told him about these feelings. He asked why I wanted to change my body - and I listed all the reasons I didn't like being a woman, a lot of which are about how other people perceive and react to me, and how it affects how I move through the world, and how it affects how I behave in reaction to other people's assumptions. One thing we ended up discussing, which sent me spiraling further, was, the idea of changing your body because of how other people react to you and what other people think. He said, 'isn't that their problem and not yours?', and also that the things I hated about being a woman, all come from the made-up idea of a 'woman' that people have pushed onto me. An analogy he made was, if someone bullied you for your clothes, would you go buy a new wardrobe?

Because I don't experience as much body dysmorphia, my fixation on low-dose T is solely about changing how other people react to me, and not to cure dysmorphic feelings. Though I would love to have my body be more androgynous or masculine, I have long accepted that it is unlikely with my body type. I do agree with many of the things that came up in the conversation with my partner. Afterwards though, I have been struggling with feeling that changing my body to make people treat me different would be because I'm not strong enough to just not care. I am able to shove all these feelings back into a box, from which they will only burst out a few times a year. I just don't know if I should. My instinct is that, if it's just society, maybe the true middle finger to gender is not to transition because of it. But also, I am sometimes miserable how I am.

&#x200B;

I know this is really a lot of jumbled thoughts, I just don't know who to talk to about this. I would really appreciate any thoughts from anyone that empathize with any of these feelings!"	"I've wrestled with similar thoughts about, would I still feel/want to be non-binary if our society was more equal and women weren't treated the way they are. I haven't really come to a solid decision and am kinda vaguely, casually gender non-conforming sometimes and use they/them pronouns occasionally, so yeah, definitely have not figured out the answers to these questions. 

But I guess my feelings are that other people's perceptions of you are still a valid reason to pursue changes that will make you more comfortable. Whether that discomfort is internal or external doesn't really matter, the fact is that it's there. It also sounds like you have been doing a lot of repressing of your feelings, so it's possible that once you start making more changes that you'll realize how much better it makes you feel. But, ultimately, if it's because of society and people's reactions.... Your options are either to remove yourself from all society and become a hermit on a mountain top kinda deal, or else you make the adjustments you need in order to feel comfortable in society.
So I've been contemplating low dose T myself, as well as a name change (which will be happening) and a double mastectomy because I want to view my own body as androgynous. But that's because I hate that part of me in the mirror. 

Unfortunately, in your case, my friend, I don't know that low dose T right off the bat will help. From what you've said the biggest issue you have is how others view you, and I totally get it. Growing up I had the biggest chest in school and people judged how womanly I should be based on that alone. Plus a mother that would buy me girlie type clothes for Christmas and birthdays because I was female. I wore a dress to my high school graduation because she wanted it. 

It took me years to figure out I was non binary and I took the first steps by concealing my long hair and, like you, wearing baggier clothes.Being mistaken for a boy felt good, but I never wanted to be one. I was neither and both all in one. I began to wear men's clothes because I liked the way they looked on me and society began to shift its views on me. The confusion at first was palpable. However, me figuring out me first gave me confidence I never knew I had. I tuned out what society expected of me for a time and focused on what made me feel good. Now I wear men's pants (pockets are my life), suits, and bow ties (I have an extensive collection) on the regular.

Any body type can be androgynous. It really depends on your style and how you present yourself. Attitude goes a long way with how society views someone. Also, don't be afraid to talk about it with people before you hit the breakdown stage. My therapist constantly reminded me to not shove things in a box and then gave me a handy tool portraying two circles. One circle was things that I had control over (my looks, my reactions, my choice in people), and the other was things out of my control (society, other people's reactions, government, etc). When I get overwhelmed with the feeling that I'm not good enough or society is looking down on me I bring out that chart and remind myself of what I can and can't control. I remind myself that who I want to be is enough. 

I hope in some small way this helps. Build a support network of people that want you to be happy in whatever way you see fit. Take the time to tune out the rest of the world and focus on what you want for yourself. Remind yourself that gender is a social construct and you owe society nothing when it comes to how you portray yourself. Be whoever you want to be and I'm going to be over here cheering you on all the way.
I'm an AMAB person and am considering taking E. I relate to a lot of what you're saying.

As a person with Asian heritage, I've wondered how having less Asian non-binary and trans representation affects my ability to 'see myself.'

I personally identify as agender because as far as I know, I have no internal sense of being a man or a woman.

Genetics gave me this body, and it just happens to be 'male.' I've asked myself so many times, 'why can't I just accept my body for what it is?'

Society treats me a certain way because it perceives me to be male. I deeply wish it didn't, and I don't know how I would feel if we lived in a world that had a more expansive and liberated concept of gender. 

With where I'm at in my life, I find myself at the edge of, on one hand, being utterly exhausted of society perceiving and treating me as male (and knowing that without changing my presentation, that likely won't change in my lifetime), and on the other, being scared of how society will treat me if I present more femme.

Here are a couple links that have been shared here that have helped me.

For now I've decided to try some of the more low-stakes options ‚Äì pronouns, hair style, accessories, makeup, clothing. (Even laser hair removal feels relatively low-stakes to me because I've never liked my facial hair anyway, even when I thought I was cis.) I'll see how I feel in 6 months.

You don't have to rush into a transition. But you also don't have to wait.
i don't have anything particularly helpful to add, just wanted to say that i relate really hard <3
Sounds like you might have social dysphoria - body dysphoria is not the only kind.

This info helped me a lot on my journey - I don't experence a lot of well defined body dysphoria, but a *lot* of unbearable social dysphoria.
Thanks for this post! 
It actually feels like you‚Äôre in my head. I have the exact same thoughts right now.!!!
Except i‚Äòm not asian, already 29 and my partner is a woman who 3 weeks ago said ‚Äûif you don‚Äôt feel like being a woman, that‚Äôs fine to me, i will love you no matter what and i will help you explore who you are‚Äú

That last part is an important difference. I don‚Äôt have to be ashamed for not feeling fine with who i have been and not knowing who i am or want to be. 

I really hate what people see in me, expect of me and so on. I‚Äòm not sure yet, if I really need to embrace another label or change my body. Part of me wants to no NOW and is so nervous about it and wants the whole process to be over. But another part knows, this will need time. From the first moment i officially formed this/your question in my head i knew it was going forward but it might be a slow ride... that was 3 months ago. Since then, most helpful were 3 things: reading/watching what others (trans, enby, researchers, drag kings) had to say, talking to 4-5 good friends who have questioned their sexuality&gender too (all of them came to a different conclusion so i really went for a broad horizon) and last but not least, my therapist who told me ‚Äûbe gentle and kind, don‚Äôt rush, you will find out, i‚Äòll be there for you. For a start, stop pretending and stick to what you know, the rest will come eventually‚Äú 

And my tip for you is: don‚Äôt tell yourself you‚Äòre not strong. You are! You‚Äôre finally accepting and following those thoughts. It‚Äôs only a start but don‚Äôt let anything stop you. No matter what your conclusion is, (physical/name transition or not, enby or mor, pulling the middle finger towards society or not) it‚Äòs possible to find it. Believe in yourself and you will know once you have found the answer

In the meantime: if you feel like exchanging thoughts don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me :)
yeah wow that's a very succinct way of putting it, I am in approximately the same place about that ;/

And man yeah, I guess it's hermit time lol

I really appreciate your response - I think I needed to hear that it would be okay to do something like that to be able to rest easier. thank you xx

Any tips from AMAB enbies on affirming your gender? T is making me physically euphoric, but I miss my androgyny	"**TLDR; I‚Äôve been on T long enough to ‚Äúpass‚Äù as a cis guy to most people. I dressed pretty masculine pre-medical transition, and I haven‚Äôt updated my look, so people don't think I'm queer anymore :(. I‚Äôm looking for advice on (hopefully simple) style and expressions that help you affirm your gender as masculine-assumed and/or AMAB-perceived enbies..**

*Edit* My apologies, I didn‚Äôt mean to imply that I cared about AGAB with this post, everyone‚Äôs replies have been very helpful regardless of AGAB and you don‚Äôt need to share it with me! I tried to emphasize masculine/AMAB-perceived, as a way to describe someone to whom femininity is GNC and femininity makes them feel androgynous, which would not be an accurate description of a lot of enbies, regardless of AGAB. My comfort zone style pre-T was using masculinity to feel androgynous, so I‚Äôm now I‚Äôm a little lost and ended up more gender conforming than I wanted. (Anyone know if there‚Äôs an easier way to describe this ?)

For background, I‚Äôm a queer enby in my mid-20s, I started T and got top surgery 1.5 ish years ago. I took to T very quickly and have developed a lot of facial hair and a *very* muscular frame extremely quickly with little effort (I come from sturdy folk). It‚Äôs been nice, I‚Äôm feeling present and euphoric in my body, and I‚Äôm happy with my relatively gender-neutral voice, as I‚Äôve also been able to keep a good bit of my upper vocal range. However, I am now experiencing way more social dysphoria due to passing as a cis guy 95% of the time. My gender identity is queerness; my femininity is inspired by femme gay men, and my masculinity is inspired by butch lesbians. 

Pre-transition, I was ‚Äòeffortlessly androgynous.‚Äô This was largely due to my being thin and white with female secondary sex characteristics and short hair. I also tend to dress like a geology professor or an exercise goth as those are my easy comfort zones. I‚Äôm socially very used to being perceived as a butch lesbian, which was wrong but fun. I had relatively minor social dysphoria that either came from a small minority of lesbians (who couldn‚Äôt fathom how I could look so butch AND be bisexual with a lot of feminine mannerisms), or from the few straight men I dated.

Suddenly, about 6 months ago, I must have hit a critical masculinity point where I am perceived as a cis straight guy by the vast majority of people? If I‚Äôm inspired to dress up for queer events or parties, I am perceived as a cis gay man, which is still incorrect but significantly better. However, casual or dressed up, I‚Äôm feeling really alienated from nonbinary and wlw queer communities. Even when I introduce myself with they/them pronouns, and the femme-sounding name I‚Äôve had since birth, it feels like people don‚Äôt relax around me until I out myself as trans. I stopped doing this because I don‚Äôt want to reinforce transmisogyny; I have no desire to be a part of a community that requires AMAB-perceived people to be hyperfeminine and/or medically transitioning to be accepted. Most people in queer bars (trans people included), literally refuse to believe that me and my (classically attractive, very queer lesbian) girlfriend are together unless they catch a glimpse of my top surgery scars. I am coming to terms with this, especially as my girlfriend knows me for me and I have an affirming community with close trans queer friends who know me too. I don‚Äôt feel the need to change myself to fit into a shitty queer scene, but I do socially feel most euphoric when people can‚Äôt gender me consistently and assume I‚Äôm queer before I open my mouth, and it‚Äôs jarring that this has changed essentially overnight. 

**Any suggestions for how affirm your queerness/androgyny when your body is perceived to be inherently masculine?** My fashion priorities are usually ease and comfort for daily wear in a mostly casual office. I‚Äôm willing to try most things as my limited funds will allow, but I have a few constraints beyond just dysphoria. The only things I‚Äôm unwilling to try due to dysphoria (for now) are skirts and anything with a structured bust. More generally, I have to work around some sensory issues‚Äîcan‚Äôt do most dangly/flowy things for more than an hour‚Äîand I have to consider the reality of my ADHD, which means I‚Äôm *highly* unlikely to form a new makeup habit. I enjoy goth aesthetics, but I would also love to get over my fear of matching colors ‚Äúwrong‚Äù and feel more confident in putting together a louder outfit.

I understand not all affirming things have to do with fashion. Any help is very appreciated <3"	"I don't know if this will help but for me it's in the accessories - bright pink watch, cute earring, cute phone case, and painted nails - either in a subtle sheeny colour that isn't obvious or sometimes more obvious colours. At formal events I wear eyeliner. I find it still allows me to enjoy my ""masculine"" appearance (which I don't want to change really) but is also my way of expressing that I'm queer that's kind of subtle but people still notice and read me as queer. Even if other people don't notice I find it affirming especially when I'm in a formal setting where I tend to feel more uncomfortable with binary norms.
i'm not AMAB, but i've felt similarly to you before. honestly just growing out my hair, wearing earrings all the time (u can get ones that r rings and stay in always if u dont wanna deal with picking em every day) wearing a skirt or even a dress now and then, ponytails too lol makes people second guess me. basically just stuff only girls are supposed to do, or acting very femininely with your behavior at times i think makes people go ""huh??????""
Long-ish blue hair, earrings/piercings, jewelry, painted nails.  All in matching blue üíô
Like others have mentioned I will wear a rainbow, trans, or non-binary flag colors bracelet.  I have pins on some bags and my work name badge lanyard with the LGBTQ flag and my pronouns. 

I try to find pastel colored more feminine colored shoes. Usually this is very hard due to my size but All Birds thankfully makes some very comfortable shoes in cute colors in ‚Äúmen‚Äôs‚Äù sizes. Same with clothing but it can be doubly hard to find fun colors because I need a tall size. 

I also style my hair in a more feminine way and keep it longer. I recently got it died purple (mix of purple and brown) and it‚Äôs almost been a month so now it‚Äôs this light lilac and blue color which is pretty cool. 

I also shave everyday and have a skincare routine to try to keep my skin clear and healthy. I also pluck and shape my eyebrows. 

I think those are all the things I do as a amab non-binary person to try to feel like myself and not try to force myself to act and look like a cis man. Nobody is going to mistake me as not being male normally. The only exception is if I‚Äôm sitting with a mask and they don‚Äôt get a good look and just go based on my hair. 

So I‚Äôm just trying to embrace the more ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù things I always liked without shunning them for fear of how other will perceive me. But I don‚Äôt wear dresses or skirts or other jewelry.  I do have a shoulder bag I use though because it sucks having your pockets jammed with a bunch of junk pulling your pants down, lol. 

My top recommendation to you would be the pins and bracelets because those are affordable and easy. The hair dying and maintaining is a lot of work and extremely expensive so I don‚Äôt recommend it if you‚Äôre on a budget. 

Just my 2 cents!  Hope some of it helped. You sound cool AF!  So glad you have made these changes to feel more like yourself and are still doing such thoughtful self exploration üíúüåà
I personally know I don't owe anyone androgyny, but it makes me feel good. For me it's any fem accents I can do without highlighting parts of my body that make me see myself as masculine. For someone in your shoes, maybe leaning into some of the things that used to make you feel uncomfortable might help. Now that you have changed aspects of your physical self, simply dressing more fem, especially in a style that speaks to you. might help you achieve that sort of double secret meta gender that feels so good. Higher waists, queerer haircuts, makeup, or pretty accessories. Good luck, and may you feel deeply hot.
I‚Äôm AMAB and identify as genderqueer. I try to dress androgynous for work such as chunky shoes with detailed trousers, a contrasting vest and bow tie. After work, my clothes lean more feminine with an emphasis on comfort.
Painted nails, kilts, and femme-colored hair are all great. Most folks pick me out as an enby, and I'm a 300-pound powerlifter and rugby player
So, I am AFAB but pretty masc in some aspects already, like you I suspect that if I took T I would pass as a cis man VERY quickly (especially since I'm nearly 6 feet tall).  When I had my hair cut short, if I was dressed in a way that my hips/ass weren't immediately obvious (usually when bundled up for Canadian winters) I'd get ""misgendered"" ie. called sir occasionally until I started speaking haha.  I certainly didn't mind but yes definitely tipped me hugely towards the masculine side.  A big thing I did was grow my hair long again to have a bit more versatility (and also I just like my long hair), but I intentionally keep it natural coloured and in a more gender neutral cut so that it can do androgynous well and doesn't seem TOO femme *on me*.  Maybe this could be a technique for you, grow your hair out and/or dye it in a more feminine style?  

My new person is AMAB but also gender diverse, and while obviously AMAB is also obviously queer.  They also have long hair, and often wear clearly feminine pants - tight high waisted skinny jeans or leggings, high waisted wide leg linen pants in a pastel colour, etc.  The biggest tip I'd give you as far as colours is pick one to go in an outfit and then keep the rest of it in neutrals, that's a pretty easy way to do fashion without being super fashion savvy haha (I'm not really either, no shade).  I luckily tend to gravitate to the same 3 or 4 colours that I like and thankfully look good on me when shopping so my wardrobe tends to be pretty unintentionally cohesive.  Another big one is learning about undertones and what colours fit together in ""families"" so to speak."	12look6	NonBinary	16	1.0	2023-04-14 07:46:31
Laughing at the idea of me never coming out at work...	"So, I'm transmasc and I've been on a medium-ish dose of T for a couple years and have had top surgery, but I'm almost always gendered as a woman still and that's how I'm perceived at my new-ish job--which is in a fairly liberal field (e.g. Trump bashing is encouraged in company wide meetings). 

But I feel like, eventually, I'm going to start passing as a man--especially since I'm thinking of upping my T dose. So I've been just sort of idly imagining what that would look like if I just.... never said anything. I mean.... people would eventually have questions--they probably \*already\* have questions, but.... who's going to say anything? 

And since the changes happen so slow, they might not pick up on the fact that there \*are\* changes for a while--especially since I started this job mid-transition. Will they just look at me one day and be like... wait.... was she.... always like this? And since I'm sort of masc now, they might not really be able to remember!

And the thing is, I really don't care about pronouns--he, she, they, are all good to me. And I'm already being called by my new name at work. So I'm unsure when to come out or even why that would really be necessary, in the sense that I'm not asking for any changes to how people refer to me and the bathroom issue is void because of remote working. 

I feel like the only thing that would ""make"" me come out is when, inevitably I'd imagine, someone from another department calls me ""he"" in a meeting and someone I know ""corrects"" them, because I certainly wouldn't. And if that did happen,  I would just have to be like ""actually, any pronouns are fine"". And who knows what would even happen from there. 

I wonder if my manager (or potentially someone else?) would eventually reach out to HR to be like... what's the deal? But how would they even phrase the question? Like... ""why is she a man now?"" Lol. 

Right now, the plan is to come out once I've been there a year. Just in case my manager/coworkers can tolerate GNC people but hate trans people and I have to find another job. But even then, what is my announcement going to be, ""Here's an explanation of my gender because I'm guessing you're confused. No action required.""? 

I'm worried about this issue in a real way, but every time I think about it I just have to laugh at the idea of just letting everyone be silently confused and just letting it play out. I feel like that must be a bad idea for some reason, but I honestly can't really think of why."	"No don't come out, it's much funnier that way. Actually, for less trolly but similar reasons, i am not planning to come out either. We need to make this more common, because if there's no coming out, there won't be this strict divide between cishets and queers anymore, normalizing what should have been normal in the first place.
this is honestly what I plan on doingü§∑üèª love it!
that's so funny

firstly you're not obliged to come out ever, no one is owed that information about you, and if you're comfy with the status quo why change it? 

secondly this is the ideal opportunity for the world's greatest prank. please, please do this.
I‚Äôm sorry if laughing at this is not what you are looking for but this would be so funny. Really pull one over on the cissies. I love it
That is a really good point! The only reason I have to come out would be to mollify other people's confusion, but I'm not actually obligated to do that. People should be free to just exist as they are without explanation.
precisely my point :)"	s0e3md	NonBinary	15	1.0	2022-01-10 07:18:41
Feeling fake	"Rant time, bear with me. 

So I'm starting out on my social/non-medical transition and it's been rocky. 

I've always identified as being ambivalent towards gender. I just didn't care about what was for boys and what was for girls, I did what I wanted. That said, I've always presented very feminine and prefer to wear skirts (pants are evil). My main beef with my AFAB has always been 1. My uterus, i hate that thing so much 2. That my genitalia should determine how I act and feel. 

For the most part, I am comfortable with my sex (the physical characteristics) but my gender does not line up with that sex. I mostly blame a binaty culture for this. If I could be a female sexed person in an androgynous role within society (that everyone accepted and understood that my physical characteristics did not determine my internal gender), that would be my dream.

Now that I' taking steps to look more androgynous, I sat down with my husband to revisit my gender. We've been talking about it regularly to make sure we're on the same page. After talking through the above info he mentioned that he would support me through this but would always see me as a girl who wasn't a ""girl"". 

I honestly just don't know how to feel. Part of me is worried that I really am a girl playing at being agender. Another part of me wishes I was a sexless genderless being so I didn't have to deal with thia crap. The final part is worried that when I get where I'm going I'll realise all of this is a mistake and that I was being a fake all along. 

Do any of you guys have these thoughts? How do you deal with it?"	"you're not ""playing at agender."" i'm sorry you feel that way. i feel that way sometimes too. transition doesnt help with that feeling bc now i feel like i'm a trans dude ""playing at agender"" so to speak. but i got accusations of being a ""confused lesbian"" from within the trans community (aka from binary trans dudes) before i transitioned and that rly messed me up.

what your husband said was messed up and insensitive. even if he feels that way *now*, he should have kept it to himself. that's a very invalidating statement. edit: also, feelings change over time. when i first got w my fiance he wasnt sure he would be attracted to me post-top surgery. hasnt been an issue in the slightest.

as for worrying you will regret your transition, everything that is non-medical is reversible. even some of the medical stuff is. that's a common worry, but worst comes to worst & you can turn back and change your mind. experimenting with your presentation is normal & natural & doesn't mean youre faking anything. and even if you go back to presenting ~as a woman~ that doesn't mean you're a woman.

hope this helps, sorry you've been having a difficult time.
Re ""uterus issues"": I'm not sure I get what you mean, but I'm AFAB and periods have always been about extreme dysphoria for me (not to mention extreme pain). And my doctor got me to try a mini pill that doesn't contain any estrogen (because needless to say estrogen makes me even more dysphoric about being ""too feminine"" body shape wise) and which would hopefully eliminate my periods altogether. It worked, and when I googled the active ingredient (desogestrel), it said ""mild androgen"". And after years of taking this I've actually noticed that my face has got more angular and my breasts are even smaller than they have always been, and that with exercise I can get much closer to the androgynous look I've always wanted. It just makes me incredibly happy by making me more myself.

Anyway. You're valid. And I hope you get to a point where you can always be comfortable.
This helps a lot. It's relieving to hear that my feeling aren't uncommon. At this point I've accepted that I'm probably going to end this journey looming more butch lesbian than truly androgynous, but anything is better than right  now.

Being able to reverse my transition is why I chose non medical for now. Maybe I'll find down the road that I'm okay with my female presentation, but if that happens I'll deal with it at the time. For now my best bet is to keep mvoing forward and remember that self doubt is common.

As for my husband. Yeah, he's like that. He is a great man and incredibly supportive, but he sucks at articulating his thoughts. I get what he was trying to say (which is that even if I present as a girl, he'll think of me as with physically feminine charateristics but not a girl).  He's trying so hard and I don't want to burst his bubble by telling him to watch how he words things.

Edit: spelling and typos
Yeah, periods suck. I hate having a uterus mostly because I hate that I have the capability to produce children and am so markedly female. For as long as I can remember, I've hated having a womb and wanted it out. One day my doctor will let me remove it. It's just a constant reminder of my perceived place in life.

I'll have to look into desogestral. Lord knows my boobs are too big already. Anything that could help with that would be amazing (I like them alright, just wish that I didn't have frickin Es)."	9ywusu	NonBinary	14	1.0	2018-11-20 22:00:35
How do I know if I'm non binary?	"Hey all, I'm new here and recently started questioning my gender.

I'm afab, and have always thought of myself as just a butch lesbian, but recently I've been questioning if I'm actually not as cis as I thought. I get a sense of euphoria when I'm referred to as not female, and I've been really enjoying presenting super masc. I've found I get uncomfortable about my chest when I'm in public, and I just got a binder and I feel so happy when I wear it. I love how I look in male clothing, and got a haircut that I adore because I look more masc. I've gotten uncomfortable being referred to as a girl and have been intentionally lowering my voice and moving in a more 'masculine' way. I despise my hips and curves and want a sharper jawline.

That's not to say I don't like my feminine side though, I like skirts and crop tops and makeup and my lesbian identifier. I don't want facial hair and don't care about my chest when I'm alone or naked (most the time).

(TW: ED) I have a diagnosed eating disorder and body dysmorphia - so I guess what's really messing me up is am I feeling this way because of dysphoria or dysmorphia? Am I questioning being trans as a way of coping with my general hatred of my body and with the hope that there's a way for me to like myself (by transitioning)? Or am I actually trans but just confused by my mental illness? 

I guess I just want to know how you guys realised you were non binary and what your thoughts about my situation are? 

(I'm not currently in a place where I can speak to a gender therapist about this, and I feel I guess disrespectful talking with my trans friends about this cause my dumb brain thinks that if I'm 'faking it' then I'm just invalidating them by bringing it up :///) 

Thank you all - sorry about the long post"	"I'm not qualified to discuss how to separate body dysmorphia from body dysphoria (besides the definitions), but the only way to fake being trans is to purposely lie about it. So don't worry about that. Questioning is always valid and you should feel free and empowered to explore your gender, regardless of the answer.
It definitely sounds like you're nonbinary to me, without a doubt. Being an enby doesn't mean you can't enjoy your feminine side or ID as a lesbian! Feel free to dm if you want more directed support, I ~am~ a gender therapist lol
As an ex-anorexic AFAB, the confusion between dysphoria and dysmorphia is a Big Mood honestly. In all seriousness, though, you do sound a lot like you're nonbinary as opposed to just experiencing issues from eating disorder nonsense. The euphoria you're getting when presenting more masculine is a pretty good sign to me that you're not just fixating on body image in a way that furthers your eating disorder. 

Really though, if you're happy presenting in a nonbinary way and it feels good to call yourself nonbinary, I would talk to a close (non-cis) friend and basically say that you've been struggling a bit with your gender identity lately and think you're non cis and would like to explore that more in-depth (from experience, hearing other people use they/them pronouns for me and being aware of how I was feeling about femininity/gender was very validating for me and let me know that I was on the right track). They should be more than understanding, if they've questioned their own gender identity at all, and I don't think any reasonable person would think that you're invalidating them by having thoughts about your own gender identity. Best of luck!
Thank you!
Thank you! It's really good to hear someone else dealt with this stuff...
Oh btw every single trans person I know, myself included, has worried that they're ""faking it."" Ask your trans friends if they'd be willing to talk to you about it!
Thank you that's really good to know, thinking about it I thought the same way when I was coming out as gay"	byy1vm	NonBinary	14	1.0	2019-06-10 13:46:27
I feel like I dont belong anywhere.	"I need to write this down cause I feel like I'm going crazy and there's nobody here that could help me.

&#x200B;

I'm trying to figure out who I am and so far I've been feeling so miserable it's even hard to put it into words. I feel like a joke. I don't know if there's a place where I can belong.

(I'm not a native speaker of the english language so forgive me if it's gonna read a bit funny. Im also on the autistic spectrum, which makes me a bit rigid sometimes. Hope it's ok.)

TW: mentions of abuse, hard feelings

Growing up, femininity was over imposed on me in all the ways one could imagine, and I hated every single bit of it. I hated all things that made me look ""pretty"". Makeup felt like an aggression on my face.

I would get euphoria when seen as a boy. I tried so many times to fit in with them, to no avail. I wasn't super interested in getting with the girls since I felt like I was so different from them. But I still had strong feelings for girls that felt one of a kind - like me.

I was trying so hard to do many things that were boy like, like pissing while standing or get into fights. When picturing myself, I would always imagine myself being muscular and flat chested. I was even drawing myself that way.

But then I hit puberty and my chest started to grow and hated it so much, I would dream and fantasise of getting into an accident so bad that they would have no choice but to remove it. It made me feel so frustrated that all of a sudden my body changed in this way. My hips widening and the like. I couldn't stand to look at myself in the mirror and see this body that didn't feel like it belonged to me.

But then again, coming from a country that has EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING gendered, even tables and chairs, and where neutral things dont exist... I just assumed my natural task was to ""become"" a woman, and that that was it.

I didn't even challenge the thought cause all my life I just loved life until that point. But with puberty there came the sudden conviction that I was so different from anybody else. That I couldnt' belong. That I just wasnt like other girls.

Any form of alternative womanhood than the default one was my biggest aspiration. I desperately wanted to look like a cute emo girl, the outcast I felt that was me. I had quite the turbulent childhood, not really living with my family for the longest while... I just wanted to finally get by. To find my next of kin. That has always been my obsession: finding someone that I could see myself in. And I really did try everything out to find out who I am...

I ended up getting obsessed with a guy in my school, someone I was SURE was that one for me without even knowing him while, all the while, I was getting this super intense feelings for my best girlfriend, to the point where I was desperate for her to just love me. And I had these feelings all the time without even questioning what they could really mean. All I know is that if I look at my journal entries from back then I was constantly... constantly worrying about what she thought of me. Praying that I would mean to her what she meant for me. Feeling so honoured by having her writing me back. All this while I was consciously so sure that what I felt for the guy I was talking about was love and that that was perfectly normal and that to spend all that time just waiting for him to fall for me, without even speaking to him or having met him, was just natural, normal. He was the boy, and I was the girl, could I make it any more obvious? Things of that nature.

I spent all high school navigating these complicated feelings, consciously thinking about one thing while at the same time feeling so strongly about another. With my nowadays awareness around love and affection I cant even bring myself to understand what that obsession for that guy was. While I desperately miss this girl that used to be my friend, oh so dearly.

And, of course, nowadays understanding of gender and identity does bring into question my feelings about my own gender... but oh... where to even begin?

I said my past has been wild. The thing is, in actuality, not to dwell into details, I was HEAVILY abused by multiple men in many ways. Growing up, since I was very young. And, when high school was wrapped up, I met a guy. He fell for me. He abused me. Then he left me and for years, years, years... I couldnt stop loving him.

There's parts of me that still do. I saw the vulnerable abused child in him and just wanted to take care of that so badly. But he treated me poorly and left, accused me of being fucked up and all the like. There again, I spent years... years just doing everything I did in the hope that one day he'd realise I was the one for him.

Do you notice a pattern? Oh yeah. Never once in those years... never once I thought about me for me. Always somebody else.

Eventually I was the one who left home, went living away, had a chance to make my own life... and, how do I say this? All these things lurking in the back of my head came to the surface and made me question: who the fuck am I? Removed from these landscapes, from the orbit of these people I was so dedicated to other than myself, who the flying fuck am I?

It was when I started hanging out with people that I found out that there are more than just two genders. I didnt even... didnt even remotely thought about the possibility for most of my entire life. Just now... in the recent few years... just now the concept entered my mind.

As soon as I heard that there was such a thing as non binary I started thinking that maybe I'm not all that cis. More than that, it was the first gf I ever had to tell me that my childhood feelings had a name. But I brushed it off. I didnt feel that strongly towards my body anymore. I dont think I do even now. And yet..

and yet I kept thinking about it. My friends would tell me non binary is made up. That just people that have interiorised gender norms to the core would think that that existed and that the problem wasnt gender itself but gender norms. That girls can be masc and boys can be fem without that saying anything about their gender. I said ok. I guess I'm just a masculine girl.

But again... that stuck for some reason. I kept on hanging out with queer people that then became my friends. It felt awkward to vocalise these feelings sometimes: mentioning them, calling it ""dysphoria"", immediately made them perceive me as a man. And I felt... iffy. Like that wasn't correct for me either.

And that's the kicker: all this? All this still feels quite... iffy. Am I nonbinary, or am I just fooling myself into making up a non existing gender to escape the pressures of womanhood? Is it that I can't just accept that I'm a masculine woman? Isn't it that I'm just a woman trying to invade queer spaces?

All these questions, these voices in my head that dont feel like mine but sure do look like they are, fucked with me. When I started associating with being non binary more often in public I started playing around with a few new names. I started looking into top surgery and hormones. I told myself, this year is the year I'll transition. That will be enough to prove... that I'm not making this up.

Yet when I felt like it was time to do all these changes, I started feeling sick to my stomach. Why? Why would I do all this if it wasn't autenthic? I kept asking myself. But for much that I like my chosen names, that I feel like they belong to me to an extent... I see myself completely in my given name. Of which said chosen names are a variation of.

I used to have this intense dysphoria about my chest. Here I am asking myself: do I still have it. And the answer is... I don't fucking know.

Some days I just fucking hate my chest and want all of it to disappear. Some days I just wish it was smaller. Some days it's ok, actually.

About hormones... how do I feel about the changes they would bring? I surely dont want to lose all of my hair, but I'd love a bit of facial hair. Bottom growth sounds like a lot of fun. Fat redistribution? Oh god, please!! Take this motherfucking curves away from me, make me feel ok at looking in the mirror again!!!!

Deeper voice? Mmmh... just a bit deeper maybe? Not looking forward to look manly.

How do I feel about my body, overall? I mean... its estabilished Id want some changes. but do I hate it? No. After all this time... I learnt to love it. I do love it. It's mine.

I look at all this and think: who the fuck is this freak that wants these kind of changes? Keep their very, VERY feminine name, maybe use every now and again the chosen ones, get hormones to get some changes but keep their chest as is? Who the fuck does that other than some kind of conservative joke about trans identities?

And most and foremost: am I trans? Do I identify as something other than girl, actually?

Well... oh, fuck me. Sometimes I get it. Being a girl and stuff. Sometimes I get being a boy, honestly. Man and Woman feel fucking foreign to me, but the attitude, the ""im just a girl"" or ""im just a boi"" kinda thing? That thing that, to me, feels more like a state of mind? That thing I get. Sometimes Im listening to a song and Im like fuck, im a boy. Sometimes I read some poetry and I wanna die cause I feel like im the biggest impostor. the sickest monster for even thinking that my journey has anything to do with nb and trans identities, cause of course Im a girl. But then I try think about it again and all of a sudden those things are gone, and Im left with something that is never that clear, never that obvious.

When I was a kid I used to think that it must be so fucking cool to know your gender. I had the biggest admiration for trans people because i felt they knew something i didnt. I asked myself if i wanted to ""become"" a boy and told myself that it would be fun, but then i would want to switch back to my girly body probably, so that would be impossible probably. and shrugged.

And... jesus... another thing I used to think? That I just wanted to grow up to have my name legally changed to something neutral, that could work for ""both"" genders. What happened to that? Well... that name was the name of my abuser. The first one, the one when I was a kiddo. So no, couldnt do that. I did open a FB account with that name and email, some time ago... and it felt so odd. Like, I was so scared that somebody would find out that I was taking the name of my abuser. I thought, then theyd know im crazy. theyd know im a joke.

&#x200B;

Whats the meaning of all this?

Fuck, I wish I knew.

If you were to ask me what do you feel about your own gender, your journey, pronouns etc... what would I say that I didnt say already?

I'd say... I'd say that I miss being a kid.

I miss feeling just ok with my name, presentation, body. I miss the time before being one or the other had a bigger meaning I cant see myself into. I miss the time when I just thought I would figure it out by growing up, when my only dream was to be ME, as an adult. To go on adventures. To become the one of a kind I felt I was.

I miss feeling that im entitled to my choices and that I get to decide who I am.

I feel absolutely miserable about the idea that what im doing is assimilate nb and trans culture to invade these spaces and bring them discomfort. Which is why, after all this time, I went completely AWOL on social media and removed any information that could make anybody think Im queer.

I dont wanna be that person. Im trying to figure out who I am. I dont wanna do it if that means being the kind of queer person that would hurt their community.

How am I feeling doing that?

A bit better... cause I feel like Im under the radar. Anonimity gave me some relief from the tension of being someone else's idea of who I should be. As either a cis or nb person. I dont wanna fucking hear judgements about my character coming from people who dont know me... who will never read this, cause im writing it under an anonymous username.

But again... do I feel like I fit in in the rest of the world, in general?

Oh, absofuckinglutely not.

Do I feel like I belong with cis people? No.

Do I feel like I belong with trans people? No. I feel like I cant do anything right. That Im just weird.

I look at myself and see somewhat of a ""woman"" experience - cause in a way Ive been one for years. There was a moment where I thought that all women experiences are similar in so many regards, but honestly when I look at my life I dont think thats true. The femininity that was coerced on me isnt the femininity that was coerced on a lot of cis people I know. I hated every moment of that. But femininity, as a whole - I dont hate it.

Im not eager to distance myself from what is perceived as feminine anymore. Some parts of being feminine I really like (like playing with makeup, to look a bit extra), but Im not sure those parts make me a woman. Again, its a feeling I get. I get the feeling of being a boy sometimes. Theres so many parts of masculinity that I adore and am enamored with, but I wouldnt think for a second they made a man. I love listening to song that deconstruct men's feelings about the world. I love listening to songs about women empowerment. I feel like they resonate with me in the same, very odd way.

When I started this journey of questioning, the first thing Ive ever written was that I feel like a boy dressing up as a girl. I still think thats true... in a very fucked up and weird way. I also used to say that my primary identity was my passion (which shall remain nameless), then there was gender. I feel that strongly. My passion brings me solace and clarity about who I am. if only I could do that with words too. If only understanding myself was as easy in any other way but through the lens of my passion.

&#x200B;

Why am I writing all this?

Cause... I'm all alone. I feel like nobody understands cause nobody even tries. and while I figure this out I dont wanna go into trans spaces and hurt trans people, especially trans women. I will never know what they have to go through. Im heartbroken by the idea that they might feel uncomfortable from what im saying, cause maybe im being a huge ass bigot and reiterating systems of oppression im not even aware of.

So forgive me if I come here to talk about this. I thought that this, maybe, could be the right place. Im running out of options. I just wanna be me. I just wanna be. And I feel like Im not even supposed to exist, most of the time. Its exhausting.

&#x200B;

Sorry for the wall of text.

Hope it didnt disrupt your day too much.

If there's anybody who... who maybe can help me understand. Who maybe relates, and has some experience on their part to offer to this mess of a person, that would be very welcome.

Thank you for reading all this, I appreciate it immensely."	"I've never struggled with my gender the same way you did, so I can't give you a lot of insight in that regard, but I would like you to know that no matter who you are, no matter what your gender is, you are valid. You are worthy and valuable and valid. You deserve to take up space, without worrying about whether you're appropriating trans/nb identites or not. You are not appropriating them. You have the right to experiment with labels you feel might fit, with names, everything. You are not hurting anyone, there's no need to feel bad.

I am so sorry that you struggled so much in life. You didn't deserve to be abused. You deserve to allow yourself to embrace all that you are. And you do belong. No matter what your gender turns out to be, it's okay, and you do belong. You are loved.

And it's okay to not know. Take all the time you need, maybe do some research into nonbinary identites and microlabels. Maybe you'll find a label that accurately describes what you are feeling, maybe you won't. That's okay though. What matters is that you treat yourself with all the kindness that you offer others and just do what makes you happy. 

Sending you lots of love :)
I understand some of where you‚Äôre coming from. I‚Äôm older and have identified my whole life as a girl (woman has always been something I couldn‚Äôt align with even when I identified as cis). But even as a kid I had mixed inclinations. I hated having my hair done, hated having it long, and screamed bloody murder when anyone came near me with makeup. I even had picked out a neutral nature-inspired name that I tried getting my family to call me. I was abused by a relative, and I shoved a lot of that down, deep (mentally at least). As I aged, I would switch between feminine and masculine clothing styles (not that it was perceived as masculine), and also hated my chest as it developed. 
I think, the only reason I hadn‚Äôt identified as nb more recently in my life (I‚Äôm mid 30s and only came out a few months ago) was because I didn‚Äôt have the language. 
That said, I‚Äôm terrified of my trans friends finding out and hating me or thinking that I‚Äôm mocking their struggles. I have some days where I wonder if correcting people on my pronouns is worth the hassle, or if I‚Äôm fooling myself into thinking I‚Äôm something I‚Äôm not. 
I do have the fortune of supportive friends who reaffirm that my feelings are valid, even if I don‚Äôt always know what those are. 
This community is very supportive and kind from what I‚Äôve seen. Take some time and read through other stories and maybe you‚Äôll find some things that help you with your own.
Hi, I‚Äôm autistic & nonbinary. 

And I have to say that I relate to a lot of  your post. 
It‚Äôs completely normal to suffer from imposter syndrome, to have these feelings that you don‚Äôt belong with cis or trans people, or anywhere. 

But it doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs true. And from what you‚Äôve described about how you feel kinda ambivalent toward gender, that‚Äôs very nonbinary. 

About the gender dysphoria, it‚Äôs 100% normal for it to come and go, just like if someone is depressed they‚Äôre going to have good and bad days, but being happy for 10 minutes or 2 days doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôre not depressed, it just means they‚Äôre momentarily feeling good.
Which, arguably, no one feels good all the time, so even if you‚Äôre not depressed, you also only feel ‚Äúmomentarily‚Äù good and that‚Äôs okay. You can‚Äôt be happy all the time. 

It‚Äôs absolutely okay to feel like a boy sometimes, a girl other times, and even neither or both on occasion, that does not mean that you aren‚Äôt nonbinary. 
And feel free to tell me to fuck off if you‚Äôre not interested in any labels beyond nonbinary, but maybe looking into genderfluid will help you feel more seen. Just let me be clear, I‚Äôm not trying to label you gender identity as a whole ass stranger over the internet, it just seems like you‚Äôre looking for community (which you absolutely have here as a nonbinary person), it just sounds like you may share some same experiences as genderfluid people (they also fit under the nonbinary umbrella).

There are also autistic people who feel that feel that their autism is intrinsically linked to their concept of gender and gender identity because of how they view social norms (gender being one of them). 
I don‚Äôt personally identify as autigender, but I do feel that my autism is intrinsically linked to my gender identity and how I view gender as social norms weren‚Äôt something that came naturally to me as a child. They were hard learned and I never have and never will understand gender norms. I understand why they‚Äôre so deeply ingrained in us at birth (capitalism, patriarchy, colonialism, etc.), but I don‚Äôt and won‚Äôt understand why individuals value them so much in their own personal lives.

I also wanted to say, even if there‚Äôs a remote possibility that it turns out, that you‚Äôre not nonbinary, that you aren‚Äôt invading anyone‚Äôs space. You aren‚Äôt coming in here trying to make anyone uncomfortable or invalidated, or being rude in any capacity, so you are not invading this space. 
And you aren‚Äôt invading women‚Äôs spaces if you‚Äôre nonbinary and you‚Äôre in a woman‚Äôs space. It‚Äôs not rude or invasive to acknowledge that a person shared a lot of experience with women even if they‚Äôre not necessarily a woman. 
Just like I‚Äôm not invading women‚Äôs spaces when I use the women‚Äôs restrooms as a transmasc person; I use the women‚Äôs restrooms because I‚Äôm afraid of being assaulted if I were to use the men‚Äôs.

Im tearing up as I‚Äôm reading this. Thank you so much. I guess I‚Äôll take some time‚Ä¶ and figure out little by little. Thank you so so so much.
I resonate so much with most things you‚Äôre saying, it‚Äôs so unreal. Thank you so much for sharing your experience! It‚Äôs helping me clearing my own head. Especially the part of not having the language. I often feel that if non binary genders came into my life while I was still developing I would have never had doubts about it, whereas right now it feels like I‚Äôm making it up, especially cause in my native language there‚Äôs no ‚Äúnatural‚Äù alternatives to binaries in every single minor thing. Thank you so so so much again. It‚Äôs great to feel this less alone.

And by the by‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry about what you‚Äôve been through. I know it fucking sucks. I‚Äôd hug you right now if I could.
Also! You can absolutely be nonbinary and a women, nonbinary and a man, and plenty of people are nonbinary lesbians. There‚Äôs a lot of queer history that backs this up. 
The idea that all labels are super strict and have very clear boundaries and rules is just something that exists in mostly online spaces (and also an idea held by younger queer folk who are trying to themselves and their place in the world). 
Absolutely nothing wrong with online spaces, they‚Äôre beautiful and helpful and they can be incredibly good places to build community, they can also be very toxic depending on where you go. So just be careful with yourself. 

And about physically transitioning, if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôre interested in, and you feel is right for you, then just remember that it‚Äôs your body and you have to do what‚Äôs best and most comfortable for you. 
If that means top surgery and some hormone replacement, then that‚Äôs fine and completely normal. And a lot of nonbinary people do opt for limited HRT instead of ‚Äúthe usual‚Äù (whatever that means). 

This may not apply to you whatsoever, this is just my own personal experience, take it with a grain of salt:
I‚Äôve started my physical transition. I started (full dose) testosterone about 6 months ago and I‚Äôve found that most of my feelings of discomfort around being perceived as masculine or as a man, are related to trauma I‚Äôve experienced. 
I‚Äôve never had a good male role model and I‚Äôve almost exclusively had bad experiences with all of the men in my life. 
I was afraid that I would start testosterone and it would feel wrong. But I‚Äôve felt more myself and more comfortable in my body than I have since I was a baby (before puberty).

The only time I‚Äôm uncomfortable being viewed as masculine or a man is when people are weird about it (medical settings, bathrooms, etc.).  So like I‚Äôm only uncomfortable with people‚Äôs perception of my gender when people go out of their way to make me uncomfortable.
Any other time it feels good and natural. I‚Äôm still nonbinary, and ideally I‚Äôd prefer people to not see me as a man or woman, but I‚Äôm much more comfortable being perceived (incorrectly) as a man than being perceived (incorrectly) as a woman.

I originally planned on being on testosterone temporarily, but I think I‚Äôm just going to stay on it. This just feels right.

And all this is just to say, do what makes you comfortable. Because the only person that you owe anything to, is yourself.

I hope this has been helpful. Please dm or reply if you want to ask anymore questions (I suck at answering in a timely manner and my life is hella hectic right now, but I‚Äôm happy to help when I can).
I hope you are having a lovely day, you find what you‚Äôre looking for, and you have a joyful journey. üíõ




Here are some things that I‚Äôve found helpful for me. Gender, sex, sexuality and identity is so much more expansive than people think. It can be beautiful and freeing to learn and explore that.

Am I trans?	"I've been asked a few times if I'm trans and have no idea how to answer. I've been saying ""I don't know?"" and ""sort of."" 

Backing up a bit: I'm an AMAB genderfluid person that doesn't really care about pronouns and encourages the observer to decide what they want to call me on their own, based on the day or circumstances. Some days I look femme, but most days (because of work and stuff) I just look super normal with my stubble coming through, no makeup, and nondescript work clothes. I'm pretty masculine those days, but not necessarily by choice as much as default. I don't intend to do hormones, but I am going to vocal therapy to get a femme voice that I can use when I'm being more ladylike/possibly more often. I really really like PIV sex and am pretty accustomed to it, though I'm also down for any variation of gay stuff. I really like the dynamic I have with ""straight"" girls whenever that works out, and I'd hate to lose that in a full transition... Plus I'm pretty sure I don't want to go all the way into ladyhood by any metric.


Idk. That's kind of a big 4 am stream of consciousness rant, but I guess the fact that this question has come up multiple times and I still don't know how to answer is bothering me."	"If you identify as something under the nonbinary then you can identify as trans if you want. Nonbinary falls under the trans umbrella and it is represented by the white stripe on the flag.
I just want to talk about something you mentioned in your post which I've struggled with too... There's no obligation for you to go through a ""full"" transition. Wonder where that idea came from. Did someone say you can only be trans if you intend to ""go all the way""? Nah. And I think it kind of implies or reinforces the idea of the gender binary, which we do not fall into. 

Rather than seeing transitioning as a multitude of stuff to do, you can say to yourself, ""I want to try just this one thing today,"" like putting on a piece of jewelry or something little, and just try it, and if it makes you uncomfortable, you can take a step away and take it off, and still be completely valid in your identity. You can be trans and never take hormones.

Anyway I suggest that you also consider words like ""gender nonconforming"" and see if you like them, or not. It's 100% up to you, don't let the expectations of others drag an answer out of you before you're fully comfortable with it. 
You can be trans and only feel the need to present feminine at certain times. I would also explore the idea of being gender-nonconforming or a crossdresser and see how those labels feel versus transgender. You said you wouldn't want to present as a woman always, but also present as masculine just because that's kind of the expectation. In a world where gender didn't matter, what way would you want to present yourself? Also would you not enjoy relationships with women as a woman in the same way as a man? I don't need to know necessarily, just some questions to ask yourself. 
I mean, when I'm a woman I'm a woman. I never actually feel like a man and am uncomfortable being called one but never contest it out of awkwardness. I don't really care about pronouns, but I don't like being called a boy or a man.

In a world where nobody cared I'd do exactly what I'm already doing, but I'd be more vocal to more of my coworkers and family about it. I have no problem telling friends and strangers because I tend to dress differently and it comes up organically, but work sort of requires a certain appearance (I'm in a production environment, so jeans and a tee-shirt with hair pulled back is the uniform) that doesn't really make people question what I want to be called. 
I think the fact that the idea of being a man makes you uncomfortable definitely indicates you may be trans. "	7dsm7e	NonBinary	12	0.94	2017-11-18 12:26:56
I'm thinking of coming out as nonbinary, having previously transitioned MTF within the binary. Advice or pointers for where I might get good advice?	"Hi everyone! So I want to firstly preface this post by saying I'm not one of the ""detrans"" types, I know that's a problem on Reddit sometimes, I'm genuinely someone that feels perhaps nonbinary might be better for me and want honest advice about some of my worries and feelings.

I transitioned about half a decade ago from male assigned at birth to female. I've had hormones, and I generally pass decently, but I don't actually pass. I look cis, but my voice is a problem. I've also been too chicken to finish electrolysis and I don't exhibit every stereotypical behaviour so maybe that gets read a little bit too.

When I transitioned half a decade ago, I literally said in a old Reddit post that I would rather stay male than be obviously trans, and while I don't actually think that's true now because I'm happier in a femme identity, I have struggled with the reality that I probably won't be one of the special few that goes totally stealth, even if you could argue my big problem, my voice, is fixable. (I realise there's some major internalised transphobia here, but I wanted to be honest for this post that it's part of my feelings and thoughts.)

I have this feeling that being trans is actually very lonely. I'm very accepted by my friends, some of which are straight cis people, but my experiences of the LGBT and queer community is that MTF people are almost shunned in some way by many, certainly nobody dates them, and I don't like being alone, but I see the people who are nonbinary basically being fawned over. Again, not the right thing to build your identity around, but one of the triggers for me think about this.

But beyond this, when I transitioned, nonbinary people honestly weren't all that visible. I hardly ever met trans people before lockdown, let alone nonbinary people, but now they're everywhere. It's totally changed, and it's made me realise that binary gender identity isn't as important as it used to be. Almost as if, if I was a little younger, and was transitioning now, I'd see if it as a much more viable option and might have went that way to begin with.

Quite a lot of things appeal about it really. For one, I feel like it might lift significant weights like caring about a shaving rash enough to stay inside, or not doing things I used to enjoy online because my voice is male. I also would stop feeling offended when people ask what my pronouns are. Things like that which would just improve my quality of life. I also feel it may be fun to sometimes experiment with different ways of presenting myself.

There's obviously more to it than this but I'm at a very early stage of thinking about this really, and I'm just putting my thoughts down here.

But if I do decide to come out as nonbinary, I'm a little bit worried about how it would go and work for me. For one, I have a very distinctly female name. Changing that would be difficult and I don't even have one in mind. I have an online content nickname sort of thing I could partly use in certain environments but it's not something I'm ever going to be using, like, professionally or something. So I like my name, and don't want to change it really, but it'll never give any other perception than ""trans woman"", especially if I stop caring about femme behaviours so much.

I also definitely want to stay femme and on hormones, obviously that's easy enough, and don't want to stop using female toilets, so I feel I need to still look broadly presented female, but then maybe it won't actually seem any different to other people.

I'm also definitely living in an echo chamber of the alternative community, the LGBT community and other queer-friendly accepting places for the most part, and benefiting from being visibly cis across a room in other spaces. I feel like any changes I might make from that could make me experience issues... I've not for example ever had to worry about employability, I have no idea if that's higher or lower if I'm nonbinary but medically transitioned, but I suspect it'd make me have a hard time in society as it's not caught up yet, perhaps more so than not quite passing.

I suppose I'm just wondering if I'm thinking of this for the wrong reasons, or if it's just my binary trans mindset making me question if certain things are still important. I think fundamentally I just want to be myself and be accepted for being myself and I feel like in a lot of environments it might be easier for that to be the case if I wasn't tying myself to this insistence that I am female and of the importance of passing, but in other environments I imagine it would be harder.

I've also wondered if there's some sort of thing like a nonbinary mindset where I could just not make massive fundamental changes and remain as I am, but try to see myself differently and come to peace with not really caring how people see me, and just be myself and behave as myself and do what I want.

I've even considered whether perhaps a nonbinary ""alter-ego"", which I guess would be being nonbinary in a way anyway, might be the way to go, and to use that for things I might enjoy doing online I'm too scared to while saying I'm a girl. But I don't even know if this sort of nonbinary is a thing or valid.

I've not even considered things like genderqueer or genderfluid which I just remembered exist while writing the last paragraph.

I probably sound like an idiot or a narcissist or something but I hope somebody can maybe give me some advice on this. Or point me to somewhere I can talk about it more. (And I'd really benefit from hearing from anyone else that's gone MTF for a long time and then gone non-binary later.) Thank you."	"Hmm I think one thing you should keep in mind is that nonbinary doesn't equal androgynous - like non-binary people can still dress for example within a certain gender stereotype - I mean, that really counts for all genders. You can be female and experiment with your style all the same. You don't have to have a different name unless you want to, or stop taking hormones, right? Your gender expression and your gender don't necessarily have to ""align"" - masc presenting lesbians are still women for example (if they identify that way).

Being nonbinary is more about how you feel and what you think fits you more. If it gives you comfort with the things you feel insecure about, go for it, try it out and see if you prefer looking at yourself in that way and being called that way. But it's not some guaranteed fix for dysphoria. I'm enby and I definitely feel dysphoric about certain things, sometimes more sometimes less. 

In general, nonbinary isn't a third neutral gender somewhere in the middle, try looking at it more as a hundred+ possible genders outside of male and female. And this can encompass anything and enbys can really come in all kinds of colours and can look all kinds of ways and use all kinds of pronouns (including he or she pronouns).
I think this is all real and legitimate. It's easy to look at the narratives people put out there about themselves and think that everyone else has this all figured out, but actually, it's usually complicated and involves some murky thoughts and feelings we don't necessarily like to admit to. And outside society *does* have a huge impact. A lot of us have experienced the difficulty of growing up before there were words for our existence available to us, and how we tried to fit where we could. I could very much imagine a version of myself who decided a binary transition was a reasonable option, if it had seemed like the way to not be ""stuck"" as the other binary gender. As it was, the biggest impediment to it was that I became aware of it too late, in my opinion, after puberty #1 had finished, and I too saw massive social advantages of remaining cis-passing compared to being noticably trans. (Eta: I wish to caveat this as having been an unhealthy and inaccurate mindset. The problem was other people, not me, and it's not you either.)

Regarding you: if calling yourself non-binary feels like it'd be freeing, it seems like there are two main possibilities. One, you're actually non-binary! Two, you have boxed yourself into a very narrow definition of what being a woman means, probably out of fear of being seen as not-a-woman. But maybe the only way to tell the difference between those two is to try it. It doesn't have to be a huge commitment right away. Finding spaces where you can experiment can be hugely beneficial. What that looks like depends on what kinds of things you like to do, but maybe starting a new hobby, or going out to a new coffee shop, or some other social experience relatively isolated from your usual life, might be a great chance to show up in your ""non-binary"" presentation. Or if you have a close friend who won't judge you for it, even just telling them you're getting tired of always trying to ""pass"" and want to try easing back on it could give you a safe space to relax on the stuff like your voice and facial hair.

Your second to last paragraph is basically the other thing I was going to say. There is no one single way to be non-binary. If you're non-binary, literally whatever you do is by definition a non-binary thing to do. This is the corollary of what I was saying about you maybe having too narrow an internal definition of what you're ""allowed"" to do if you're a woman. Just as a woman is always a woman regardless of clothing or hobbies or physical features, so is a non-binary person. Some people do go for androgyny, some go for neutrality, but plenty are femme or masc or just dgaf, and all of that is perfectly fine. A person can be she/her and choose the girliest name imaginable and still be non-binary. So if you want to dip your toes into the idea, be welcome, and please don't feel like you have to change anything you don't want to or do anything you're not ready for.
> Hmm I think one thing you should keep in mind is that nonbinary doesn't equal androgynous - like non-binary people can still dress for example within a certain gender stereotype - I mean, that really counts for all genders. You can be female and experiment with your style all the same. You don't have to have a different name unless you want to, or stop taking hormones, right?

But then surely I'm just being to be perceived as a trans woman all of the time, and I think that's what I'm uncomfortable about, if I can't be perceived as a cis woman by people, then maybe nonbinary is the next best thing. And the desire I think to just be myself, and I am quite a unique character with a unique style, rather than binding myself to something - but I care about how other people perceive me too, and I don't see how they'd perceive me any differently, which means it may not solve the problem of me being unhappy at being read as trans and treated badly for it.

> In general, nonbinary isn't a third neutral gender somewhere in the middle, try looking at it more as a hundred+ possible genders outside of male and female

Does one of those hundred genders cover ""I'm just going to be my unique self and don't think gender is that important to me now but I'm broadly going to look female and very femme and say I'm female when I have to in order to conform to the binary""? That's probably the best I can sum all of this up in a sentence. If there's some form of nonbinary that fits that, maybe I should be reading up on that (I appreciate it's not about fitting a form of it, but the experiences of others and so on might actually help me.)
Thanks for your reply! I'll guess I'll reply to some bits in case you can offer some more insight.

>I too saw massive social advantages of remaining cis-passing compared to being noticably trans.

One of my problems I think is that I see not passing as cis as some sort of failure and impediment on me. It's undeniable that MTF is the hardest identity to be, and even though I have it better than many, I'm still not really happy with the outcome. I can look great in a photo or from afar, but my identity has started to become ""trans female"" which is something I never ever wanted it to be, I just aspired to be like the cis girls around me. Now I don't aspire to be like that, most of those girls are annoying, I just aspire to be myself.

Also, if I came out as nonbinary I'd still not pass as cis, if anything I'd be less likely to pass as cis. For a start, if I stop planning my life around my shaving rashes, that'll out me more.

>if calling yourself non-binary feels like it'd be freeing

I feel like not holding myself back in the fear of being perceived as trans would be freeing. I'd just like to be able to open my mouth or go outside and not care if people know I was male assigned at birth or not, while still being happy in who I am, I suppose.

> Just as a woman is always a woman regardless of clothing or hobbies or physical features, so is a non-binary person.

Here's one of my biggest things, I guess: I don't actually really want to change how I look. I have a very feminine hairstyle, I want to keep it. I wear eyeliner (but not much make-up), I want to keep doing that. I probably want to keep dressing femme while maybe caring a bit less about it, because the times I've tried jeans I just found them restrictive. I certainly don't want facial hair. So I'm not even sure how people would see a difference. I guess it's more of an attitude thing for me, but I can't see how I'm going to benefit if I still present female and have a super female name.
I'm not sure if I can help with the first part tbh, cause as much as I'm out to my friends, I'm not out at work for example so I'm mostly passing as my agab in my daily life (even when I wear more masc clothing). I'm not sure there's a very definite way to be regarded as enby by most people, probably when you mix-match very typical things from male and female? 

But I guess the second part, what you're describing sounds like you might be agender? You could try looking into that"	uaxdl6	NonBinary	13	1.0	2022-04-24 15:37:06
Trying to Figure Out How High Estrogen Dosage Can Go for NB Folks	"I have the luxury of a primary care doctor who is not only working on informed consent, but truly seems to let me run the show depending on how I'm feeling and what my effects are.  I had an orchiectomy 2 years ago, so testosterone is long gone, aside from the trace bits from adrenal glands.  I gradually increased over time from 1mg/day of estrogen to 4mg/day.  Then the damn VA insisted I see one of their docs, who insisted that I drop back to 3mg/day.  I tried that for a couple months, and just didn't feel good, so I'm just going back to my regular doctor.  He had me boost back up to 4/mg, but he knows I'd actually like to go with a higher dose.

I'm finding that even though my outward presentation (including full beard) is mostly what folks consider masculine, I feel better and better the more feminine my body becomes.  Having gone back to 4mg/day, I'm finally starting to see some clear action in terms of my chest (overweight with ""moobs,"" so it's not always been easy to tell for sure).  On the other hand, erections started coming back when I was down to 3mg/day, and they really haven't disappeared at 4mg/day this time.  I've had some body hair reduction, but I'm getting to a point where what was once mostly genital dysphoria has grown to include things like body hair.  I feel like I need more changes toward the feminine than I ever thought I would when I began transitioning.

For those AMAB folks who are non-binary and on HRT, how high have any of you gone with your estrogen dosage?  I'm starting to think ""low dose"" isn't cutting it for me anymore, but not sure how high to think about increasing to get the changes I'm feeling I need.  Help?"	"I've been on HRT for 3 months. My Endo started me on 4 mg/day (one 2 mg tablet twice a day) with the option to go to 8 mg/day if I wanted.
Wow---so as a non-binary person, the endo is open to you going to the full spectrum of dosage.  Good to know!
Yeah. That's probably how much it's going to take for me to achieve the androgynous look that I'm going for.
I feel similarly--51 years of masculine development are taking some work to shift!"	6yycwm	NonBinary	15	0.94	2017-09-08 23:17:05
Could I be an enby? How did you know you were enby?	"Im afab and I experience both social and bodily dysphoria from my agab. Terms like woman/girl/lady etc make me cringe and she/her feels really dissociated from me. I also dont my body, or well, the way my body is seen by society. Especially my voice/height/waist and chest make me uncomfortable. I always refer to myself with non-gendered or masculine terms.

I didnt had this as a kid tho. My parents never forced gender roles upon me. But for some reason I always hated typically feminine things like make-up, dresses/skirts, hairstyles etc. Whenever I had to wear it, it would always make me so uncomfortable. I also went through my ""im not like the other girls"" when playing with boys. Refering to the fact I was not as ""girly/feminine"" as them. None ever talked about gender much. I thought gender = sex. If you were born with a girls body = girl. If ur a ""girl"" who wants a boys body = transboy. I never had problems with gendered bathrooms or lockerrooms. I just thought ""oh girls = female body so this is just my place to go"".  I never considered being trans as an option. Only a year and a half ago I found out about enby indentities.

But recently a kid asked me if I was a boy. Ppl asked me this before as I present kinda tomboy-ish but this is the first time such comment made me amazingly happy. Most of the time, ppl ask this with a harmful intent but I could see this kid was just curious and genuine. I wasnt necessarily happy he saw me as a boy, but bcoz he didnt saw me as a girl. This made me really question stuff. I started to experiment with presenting more masc/neutral online and it feels comfortable so far. Thinking abt having chest surgery and bottom growth is nice as well as having an androgyne voice. But even if I wanted to transition at some point I prolly cant as my family is really enbyphobic.

I feel more masc compared to the average woman but fem compared to the average man. It kinda feels like im stuck in the middle. Im greyromantic and asexual so I never really cared about gender roles in relationships as I was romance/sex repulsed during the one time I got a romantic crush on a guy, so I wasnt looking for a relationship anyway. Like I said, I feel fem compared to guys so that one crush didnt question my gender either. But maybe im associating my asexuality and greyromanticism with dysphoria, so are there enbys who are also aroace-spec who can tell me about their experience with gender?"	"I realised that gender isn‚Äôt an obligatory consequence of what my sex organs look like, and then started to take my lack of connection to both the notion of manhood and womanhood seriously (am agender).
Friendly reminder that labels are meant to help explain how you feel, not meant to put you in a box. I hear what you're saying and you're valid, but only you can decide if a label feels right for you. As a community we'd gladly take you, and if you found other labels that fit better than nonbinary those people would also accept you. You don't have to feel or look a certain way to feel more comfortable with the nonbinary label than identifying as cis. A lot of people also like to just say gender queer until they find out more about what feels comfy, it's all up to you and what makes you feel happiest! 

I hope you find what works for you, and im sorry about your family. As someone with an enbyphobic family it can be really tough sometimes, but having the transmasc community for support can really be helpful. Good luck on your journey friend <3
I actually always thought I was a trans girl my whole life. I didn‚Äôt realize I was an enby until I came out and started transitioning. I started using female pronouns and soon realized that it was just as cringe for me as when someone used male pronouns for me. Non binary transfem here.
so i started to question my gender because i feel that i dont fit in the male or female but and im genderfluid either so the non binary pop out in my brain"	104rueo	NonBinary	14	0.95	2023-01-06 11:26:35
Journey as a Transgender Demi-Boy.	"I am Elliott. I am a Transgender Demi boy. I go by they/he pronouns. I came out to my old foster mom in 2019 as gender fluid when I was first exploring my gender identity. I was with my ex at the time he was very homophobic and transphobic. He didn't wanna admit it.. it put me in that place where I was stuck. And since my gender was ""fluid"" I could just easily just say I was a girl to my non supporting ex and guardian.  I couldn't express my true self. By 2020-2021 I was experiencing alot of depression and things that go with it. In July of 2021 my ex broke up with me this was devastating. Because I didnt see his true colors.. this was also the same time where my foster mom wasn't accepting me and also the same time with exploring my romantic attraction and sexuality which I am pan and demisexual. This ended up with me being put in hospitals and not doing good things with my body. Then I met a wonderful woman I can actually say I love. She is trans and she understands me and my struggles. Because she had to deal with her parents not supporting her as well. She was person who got me through those years every day after school I'd go home and I'd just vent, or have those deep talks. Some of them ended up with me laughing so hard. She made me happy, seen, supported, and loved. Something that they couldn't do. So with that please no matter what. I care and support my trans sisters, brothers, and siblings. No matter where you are I see you and your pain. Please keep fighting. I love you. rainbow_flagtwo_hearts (Btw for context I am in a better place now and a supportive family and I am planning to start transitioning by talking to my doctor after I move out in four months)."	"Thank you for sharing this painful story. It proper sucks to have a need to express yourself but a transphobic partner preventing you from it. I'm glad you're in a much better place now and you should be proud of all the hard choices you made to get there.

Big hugs!"	tz0jku	NonBinary	13	1.0	2022-04-08 10:34:22
Struggling with Identity	"So I cam out as ENBY in February, and honestly it's been the most freeing experience of my life.

But in these last few month of Quarantine I have been really struggling:

TDLR: I would like to present as more of a Femboy but I am scared I will regret the transition. I want to know how other people have felt or what advice they'd give.

I've been very lucky in my life to live fairly apart from gender. My mother is a very masc energy in my home, and my Father took on all the traditionally feminine roles. I went to an All Girls school, so I did all of my puberty years without any gender dynamics, and I played games, scouts and sports all through my schooling. I have PCOS and Ovarian cysts, so I have never had natural periods in my life. I have small boobs, and a loud fashion taste. I have never cared what people think about me, despite living in a very sheltered community.

 I didn't stop to question my gender until I came away to University, after having only Monogamous Heterosexual relationships, I opened up and started exploring my Poly responsibly for the first time. 

Having relationships with women, ENBY and fellow Queers made me feel so much more comfortable than I had felt before. They didn't have expectations for my body, or my gender expression. I started growing my body hair out, working out more and cut my long hair short. I was using toys, and experiencing euphoria from having a penis in sexual encounters. And I felt unstoppable. I even felt attractive with no makeup on, and started using a gender neutral name to ease the dysphoria.

But since being trapped inside for the last two months, my self image has been deteriorating. I've been installing fake dreads to give me my long hair back, not being able to look at myself in the mirror as I gain a lot of my weight back. I've found some solace in dressing and trying to pass masc, even with my fat face. But with longer hair and no facial hair I just feel like and ugly girl, and it's making me feel very dysmorphic.

I've always struggled with eating disorders, and I am suddenly scared that all of this journey has been fueled by my dysmorphia and not dysphoria. I was considering starting T, but I am terrified to start and then detransition at some point. There are lots of things I love about my natural body that I will loose if I transition, and lots of things I cannot change unless I do.

I understand that there are no rules, and the flexibility of expression ENBY gives me has been the truest blessing of all. But I feel very lost and scared about making decisions that will put me in a worse situation overall. I just wondered if anyone had any words of advice they could give me? Or if they had experienced anything similar on their journey. Thanks for trawling through my braindump :)  

[The full spectrum of my daily life rn](https://preview.redd.it/hknutsxywez41.jpg?width=5500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d3225ac69f4c71d637607693ab8350fb7f663cc)"	"I also fear that my desire to transition is fueled by my dysmorphia. For me, it helps to recognize and differentiate between the two. I have dysphoria because of my hair and voice. My dysmorphia has more to do with my weight and build. The best way it was explained to me was dysmorphia is hating the size/shape/look/etc of your anatomy, while dysphoria is not wanting that anatomy no matter the size/shape/look/etc. Once I could recognize that I was having a dysphoric episode, rather than a dysmorphia one, I could deal with it a lot better. It kind of sounds like you've already found some ways of comforting yourself and those can be useful in getting past especially rough times. Best of luck to you! üôÇ‚úå
You are gorgeous any way you want to present!
You look so good anyway you present. I love the diversity of your style and hope you find a good way for yourself.
Thank you, that's very sweet üòä

Please help me with my Gender Identity? (AFAB)	"Hey guys! I'm curious about my gender identity. The following will be a long freakin' post lol. Sorry for that, I just want to make sense and not confuse people here. Anyway. since I was a little kid I preferred boy toys over girl toys. My Halloween costumes were also more boyish or gender neutral. I did wear some girly costumes too though. When I was about 4, I cut all my hair off because of how uncomfortable I was. There was always an issue with caring about my looks and making myself look ""pretty"" or feminine. I hated long hair and always rejected it and just my whole appearance in general. Even before puberty, I had an issue with slouching but more so during and after puberty. I just always felt uncomfortable with my chest, I guess? Most of my friends were boys, and I traded and played Pokemon cards with them. Didn't rlly feel like I was a boy deep down, but being like ""one of the boys"" came more natural to me. I felt like I was being fake if I tried to ""act like a girl."" I was always kinda rough and tough and enjoyed wrestling boys and girls. My sexuality used to be a bit more straight-forward before I got into my teen years. I've always been attracted to females, and maybe feminine guys but not like females. I've dated girls, but always had the issue of sex and kissing. Especially, when I discovered what Transgender meant. I didn't like to show my chest or downstairs area. Now, I don't like it, but I can stand to look at myself in the mirror. I don't want others seeing it. Not because it's ""ugly"" either. My body feels wrong. I've been seeing a gender therapist for about 4 months now and she diagnosed me with gender dysphoria, anxiety, and depression. We also talked about me being nonbinary. Tbh, I've kinda embraced that identity. It feels less constricting and stressful. Since I'm not being pushed into a binary box. I'd rather be called a boy than a girl. But, full on transitioning to a man doesn't appeal to me much. The problem is, I'm not sure how to transition or what I want. I don't know how to feel comfortable. I've gotten boy haircuts, I bind, I wear boy clothes, ect. Yeah, it makes me feel better and stuff, but I just feel lost and depressed still. Heck, the physical changes from T, I don't really want either. A lot of people want their beards, genital growth, ect. Honestly, I'd just take the muscle growth, fat distribution, face shape change. The changes that are more temporary, y'know? Even the acne. Anyway, I don't pass. I'd rather pass as a boy but, I don't wanna be 100% male either. I know I can't control the T, and how fast the changes are. I know I don't need T or top surgery to be trans. That's all well and good. But, I don't know if i'm satisfied with doing nothing either, if that makes sense. I'm just really trapped because I don't rlly dig the effects on T. I just want to feel better mentally, and not dissociate constantly. It's bad, I dissociate when I'm talking because I don't feel like my real self and I stutter, ect. I just want to feel confident and be comfortable with whose looking back at me in the mirror. I just don't know where my goal is. I don't know where my truth is. There's times I actually wanna commit suicide, because I feel like I've never be happy and be my true self.  Whatever that even is. Kay, I'm nonbinary but am I supposed to be more masculine looking? Am I supposed to look like both? Am I gunna be happier with a beard? Ah, I'm exhausted. Can somebody help me out here? Anyone else feel this way? :("	"Hey, I'm coming from the other direction (AMAB) and a different route (figured I was binary trans for a long time and only recently I'm like ""hmm, there aren't just 2 options..."").

Something you should consider is that hormones do not just have physical effects, but mental effects as well. From comparing my experiences with others, I seem to be a bit on one end of the bell curve, but HRT made a night and day difference for my mental/emotional well-being within the first 48 hours. I went from a dysphoric mess to somehow feeling positive and comfortable in my own skin. Even if there were no physical changes, you would have to pry my E out of my cold, dead hands.

Other thoughts: going on T doesn't mean you *have* to have a beard. It is entirely possible to shave, can even get laser if want.

>Anyway, I don't pass. I'd rather pass as a boy but, I don't wanna be 100% male either.

This is something I relate to pretty hard. I was surprised at how comfortable I am with people being kinda confused about my gender. I just wish they would default to ""woman"" instead of ""man"".

It's entirely cool to want to medically transition without becoming a stereotype or even fit inside the ""acceptable"" range for a particular gender. Transitioning has given me the opportunity to express myself in certain ways that are authentic but I didn't feel comfortable doing before because they felt too ""manly"", but now they just feel more balanced, if that makes *any* sense at all. For instance, I'm a naturally fairly muscular person (my brother-in-law and I are the same height, but I always had more muscle mass without working out than he did when he was working out), but pre-HRT, building muscles was a trip to dysphoria city because getting bulky in that way just felt wrong. Now, with more female fat distribution and skin changes and stuff, I can work out and stay strong but still feel kinda sleek and smooth.

Also, for the record, not all endos feel the need to follow a script and do things the ""right"" way. Some, mine included, actually understand to prioritize the patient's goals and needs. You just might need to shop around a bit.
I‚Äôve got basically the exact same situation. 

Transitioning for me being NB means that I want top surgery and to maybe go on a low dose of T, but not go the full hog into manhood.

And that‚Äôs super fucking hard to explain to people because they think that being trans is all or nothing. My parents are really bad at understanding. My mum was mourning the old me and was sad I wouldn‚Äôt be able to cook or clean or sew any more because those are all traditionally feminine things. And I just don‚Äôt understand what the hell went through her mind when I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a girl but I don‚Äôt really feel 100% like a boy either. Gender is a spectrum. I don‚Äôt want all the surgeries and I‚Äôm not sure about hormones yet but my pronouns are they/them‚Äù because to me it‚Äôs like she didn‚Äôt fucking care about that and just heard ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a girl‚Äù and assumed a million things and didn‚Äôt listen to the rest. She‚Äôs not once respected my pronouns and thinks because I‚Äôm not actively trying to get hormones or surgery that my ‚Äútrans phase‚Äù is over.

Oops this turned into a rant about my mother :/ but anyway my best advice for you is to try not to worry about what others say or do. Try doing what makes you feel right in yourself. If wearing a binder and using they/them pronouns makes you happy? Then do it! If not? Don‚Äôt stress. 

Use resources to find what makes you happiest but don‚Äôt try to follow them like they‚Äôre a guideline on how you should act.
I feel the exact same about T and what you (don't) want from it. I'm AFAB and identify as non binary. I identify like this because I know I'm not a woman, but don't want to be a full on man, though I would prefer being seen as one over being seen as a 'she'.

As I see it, gender identity is not something you would have to stress over. Sure a label could be calming, but I think it's good to understand that your gender identity is not your entire identity. I'm neither woman nor man and for me that is enough. Wether it is enough for you is something only you can decide.
You can look up taking finasteride (DHT blocker) together with T. DHT is responsible for the growth of facial hair, male-pattern baldness, and body hair, as well as bottom growth. So, theoretically, if you take finasteride with T, you would only get increase in muscle mass, voice drop, and fat redistribution. But. You also get to be a guinea pig since the effects of such HRT have not been properly studied yet, and there are very few people who have done it, even less so long term, and even less so have reported their experience online. 

Good luck with your journey <3
> DHT blocker)

Whaaaat??? This is actually a THING?? This is really awesome lol. I'm gunna def bring it up with my therapist. I mean I might dig those T changes eventually but everything just feels too fast. Atleast, thinking about it. Even downstairs growth happens like the first week."	9iqo3a	NonBinary	12	0.94	2018-09-25 09:30:07
POC and Androgyne? Am I alone out here in space?	"I've been waffling around in the trans space between trans man and some form of nonbinary for a while. I am not-binary/outside the gender binary, but my presentation and transition is typical of most trans guys, so functionally I am that. I use trans guy to explain to people I don't really care to elaborate about my gender to.

But on the other side of that, I do feel the desire to use a not-binary label for myself and with my friends/close people. I don't like the term nonbinary for myself because it's defined on a negative rather than a positive. I have been toying with androgyne, but idk I feel nervous. It doesn't seem like a very common label and I feel like an outsider entering a space I don't belong. I have met a few (like two) people who previously used the term androgyne for themselves but both of them now use something else.

I guess I really just want validation and to see if there are other people like me. Are their other POC that want a label of positive identification rather than negative? Are there other POC that use the word androgyne as their primary label for their not-binary identity? I hate feeling alone out here."	"Not poc but like using androgyne more often than nonbinary as it's more specific to my gender.
i'm a poc and i'm also very drawn to the label androgyne! like you, ive had some hesitation with using it because i almost never see anyone using it. but i really like the label. i just worry people won't know what i mean if i use it.
Thanks for responding. Do you know other ppl who use the androgyne label too?
Yeah, I've seen various uses of it (including conservative ppl using it to refer to all trans ppl??). There's also some mythical religious thing called ""The Divine Androgyne"" which talks about in the past there was a 3rd type of human (male/female/androgyne) and the androgynes were too powerful or smth so god split them into the other two. Tbh after I read about that I felt even more attracted to the label lol... I haven't really tried it out with friends or anything because my presentation pretty much aligns masc though so I feel kinda weird.
I've seen one or two others on discord."	hzqiud	NonBinary	14	0.95	2020-07-29 00:27:41
How do you deal with being visibly queer?	"Hi all,

So I‚Äôm a femboy/transperson 5 months into my transition. Back when I was presenting as a straight-passing gay guy, I could go about my day without worrying what others thought of me. Now that I‚Äôm visibly queer, I feel a lot more exposed whenever I‚Äôm out in public.

Today, I went for a quick coffee run, and I got stuck at a crosswalk with a guy walking his dog. I noticed he noticed me, but I didn‚Äôt really pay him much attention, because I‚Äôve been trying really hard to not care about how other people might react to me. As soon as the light turned green, I started walking and made it to other side before him (I‚Äôm a fast walker, lol). That‚Äôs when I heard him chuckle. I didn‚Äôt see a phone in his hand, so I don‚Äôt think he was laughing at a meme or anything. I think he was probably laughing at my backside, since my butt and waist are a little too curvy for a cisguy now.

Anyway, I got my coffee and went about my day. However, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this incident. It‚Äôs not that I care what this guy thinks. It‚Äôs just that being visibly queer is such a new experience to me, I‚Äôm not sure how to deal with these kind of situations yet.

How do you guys do it? Do you guys just learn to live with the stares? My mentality so far has been *‚Äùthese bitches ain‚Äôt paying my bills, so I should pay them no mind!‚Äù* and *‚Äúokay, but did I die??! no, I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù*"	"Ok so YMMV but I spent my formative years hanging out with (and being) absolute weirdos. I got so used to strangers barking at us because my girlfriend was wearing a costume tail that nothing phases me anymore. I don't even notice what strangers are doing around me unless they're directly addressing me. And sometimes not even then.
Made me think of the ""gays walk fast"" memes, could be that's what he was laughing about
I own it. I don't currently have coloured hair because covid (and I'm aiming for a viking braid look which I don't think I want to do with bleaching), but I used to have a short coloured mohawk, and I still have a denim jacket covered in pins, many of which are pride based. I have rainbow plugs in my ears, my t-shirts are often pride themed, and I often wear colourful patterned leggings to finish it all off.

So if someone laughs at me, y'know, big deal. I'm wearing armour.
Honestly, that last one is the one I use the most for survival. But there's also a similar option of ""what's the big deal to them anyway? I'm just being me, any problems they have are in their own head."" And from that I can lean into it to actually enjoy it or I can pull back to relax a bit
Devil's advocate: he could have been chuckling in surprised enjoyment of how curvy your backside looked.  I know I've checked people out from one side or the other covertly and then been startled into a quick giggle if they turn and the other side is just as attractive.  Maybe try to focus on the idea, ""That's right, check my ass out!  I worked hard to make my body how I like it and you should enjoy it!""
I try to ignore them. Or go as many places as possible with other people. Or wear headphones. After getting threatened a few times, sometimes unprompted and sometimes after I told them off, I don‚Äôt say anything back. I moved, though so aside from a couple times being told I‚Äôm in the wrong restroom people are chill. ü§∑

Edit: I found it very hard to deal with the constant stares and intermittent harassment where I was. I am super fortunate to have been able to leave.
When I was young and an egg, I was always outed and bullied for being the weird one. It hurt! Though my family is full of weirdos, so they told me it was good to be weird. I never understood until recently! I realized how much I love to see people out in the world, just killing it, wearing whatever they want! I love seeing people be extra as hell! So now I strive to be like them, wear whatever the i want and rock it. I dream that one day, someone will see me and think, ""they're so cool, I wish I had that confidence!"" and hopefully it'll click with them too :) I never did anything to get bullied before, might as well ignore it and be happy instead. End rant. Good luck!!
I completely understand, for me most of the time I usually forget how I'm dressed and just accept it as a part of me but other times I'll realise how bright and flashy I look and want to curl into a ball when I realize people are looking. My suggestion? Say ""fuck it, this is me, this is always going to be me."" You don't owe anyone a toned down version of yourself, do what you love! Own it!
Honestly I‚Äôve been through so much that I just don‚Äôt give a shit
that's so bad ass!!

You see, I did the opposite, lol. I spent my formative years avoiding the weirdos, because in my head, the worst thing you could be was weird. Little did I know, you guys had it right all along. You guys are the ones that give the least fucks about other people's opinion and are happier because of it! I hope to one day live my life as unbothered as you do!
Lol, I walk fast, because my father instilled it in me. He absolutely hates slow walkers. Growing up, he would give me and my brothers shit for walking slow, and now it's physically impossible for me to walk slower than 25 mph, 15 mph near a school zone.
That meme is so funny and had no idea that was a universal gay thing hahahahahaaha i always drive very fast and reckless which i hear is common too lmao
Ah, I remember being outside in fairly crowed areas weaving between people like I was trying to run from the cops but not make it too obvious... Now I hardly go out.
This was my first thought honestly, like damn ok! you just walkin around out here with all that cake??
I'm sorry to hear that you were threatened. If you don't mind me asking, where were you living and where did you move to? I live in LA, so queer people are super common here and being openly homophobic/transphobic is a big no-no.
One day you too will be awarded a costume tail, and on that day the legend will be passed on anew
I used to live in rural Michigan but now I live in Philadelphia.

Also the shock of being mildly street harassed wears off. I‚Äôm afab and started transitioning like 2 years ago so I was used to being harassed as a woman. Being constantly stared at though was what got me. I love being aggressively ignored now. The east coast aloofness is fine in that regard. Lol"	lz9mbj	NonBinary	12	0.94	2021-03-06 19:52:54
Unsure of my gender after four years	"I'm eighteen years old and AFAB. This past March, I legally changed my name, and this month I'm supposed to be starting testosterone. I've been identifying as a transgender guy for almost four years now, but lately I'm just really unsure. I know I wanted my name change, and to be on hormones. I realize it's completely possible that I'm just going through an unsure stage because I'm about to finally start a big change with medically transitioning and that after a bit of time I might be more certain again that I'm FtM. But looking at the other trans men around me, I don't always feel like them. I have a friend who's a trans man and a friend who IDs as a demiboy/transmasc person, and I have the same feelings towards my gender as the second friend rather than the first. I feel less like I want a male body and more like I don't really care about what anatomy I actually have as long as I can live and pass as a boy. I want top surgery, but mostly because I'd then pass as male without having to bind and would be able to take my shirt off, not because I can't stand to look at my chest/feel like it shouldn't be there like other trans men. I've never wanted bottom affirmation surgery because I'm perfectly happy with my genitalia and would actually prefer to keep it. I told my doctor that I'd only want bottom if the surgery methods were better, but I kind of feel like I only said that as an excuse because I felt like it was what a trans guy should say. 
I'm wondering if I fall more on the non binary spectrum rather than a trans man. I'm really not sure where to start on how to figure myself out. I know I could just say that it doesn't matter what I am and just be myself, but I feel like I need to be sure. I'm really frustrated and have no idea what to do. I feel like I should just wait it out, but if I really am a demiboy or a non binary person in general, it's going to come up later again eventually, right? Either way, I know I'm going to pursue medical transition, but I know that people can ID as demiboy/transmasc and pursue transition for their own reasons. I'm just not sure where to start. How can I go about figuring this out? Are there questions I can ask myself to at least narrow things down?"	"There's no reason you can't be both. 

I'm in a similar space, albeit on the other side of the spectrum. I feel like I am more like other non-binary people in the way I think and feel about gender, though I'd like to look like a woman and use she/her pronouns and be read as a woman.

Would being non-binary vs. being FtM change what you are wanting to do? 
I've had really similar struggles as a nonbinary transmasc person pursuing medical transition. (I felt a lot of what you're feeling when I first started, and even still now.) Honestly, even at 3 months on T, I'm still not 100% sure on my gender, I just know that I'm not a girl, my bf and I are gay, I like being on T, and I want top surgery. Am I a man, a demiguy, androgynous, agender, who tf knows?? I just know I'm most likely some kind of nonbinary and I'm feeling good about the direction I'm going! 

I just want you to know that, regardless of your gender, or whatever you end up labeling it as, you can take (or not take) whatever transition steps make you happy. Whether or not you start T doesn't have to depend on or influence your gender. Taking T won't make you a binary man, and not taking T (even if it's because you don't want to) won't mean you can't be trans, binary, or a man. Being nonbinary (in any way, even something like agender, genderfluid, or androgynous) doesn't mean you're not allowed to want/pursue medical transition. I come across this idea a lot that if you're nonbinary (especially identities like agender or genderqueer), you shouldn't care about what your body looks like (this kept my from addressing my body dysphoria for years). It's just not true; sure, that's some nonbinary peoples' experience, but not everyone's. And on the flip side, not experiencing certain body dysphoria doesn't mean you can't be a binary trans man, either.

Additionally, there's nothing wrong with taking things slow to make sure you're ready, especially for something that changes your body, permanently in some ways, and affects how other people see you. I think we have this idea that if we *really* wanted to transition, we'd jump at the first opportunity to start T, but in reality, a *lot* of us have doubts at first. If you're having doubts, that's good, it means you're taking this decision seriously. It doesn't necessarily mean you aren't meant to start T, but there's nothing wrong with pausing and working through those feelings first if it would make you feel better and help you feel more sure.

But on the other hand, there's also nothing wrong with trying something you aren't 100% sure about with the idea that you can always stop if you're not feeling it. I'm on a low dose of T in order to get slower changes, giving myself time to check in with myself and make sure I'm still liking it. I inject once a week, and so every week I have the choice to stop if I'm not feeling it. (sidenote: if you go this route, make sure you're okay with a little bit of bottom growth, that shit is FAST.) 

I guess my overall message is that you're in control of this! This is your body, your transition. Don't feel like you *have* to do anything if you're not feeling it. If you decide to pause on the T for now, it'll still be there for you in a year, 5 years, 10 years, whatever you need. And starting doesn't mean you have to do it forever, either. You are in control, I promise!!

(Feel free to PM me if you wanna talk about any of this! :D)
Sadly, I do not have the experience to help you, but I did want to say one thing:
It's always okay to change. You used to think you were the gender you were assigned at birth, and then you changed what you thought. And it's okay if what you think you are right now isn't the last step. 
Idk if you do but I know I worry a lot about ""what if I'm wrong"" and I just thought you might need to hear that
This is very familiar to me. I transitioned (T, top surgery, docs, etc.) in 2010. I was 19, and had probably also ID'd as trans for 4 or 5 years at that point. I really only had any kind of uncertainty the night before surgery, but I suppose that was probably to be expected. However, I can also say that the medical aspects of my transition never felt 100% necessary -- that is, I never experienced extreme dysphoria, nor utter certainty that transition was the right choice and for all I know I could have been fine without transitioning. Even back when I thought I had to be binary, I knew I wasn't very masculine, and I was never able to identify with the transmen I knew, and the way they felt about their bodies and transitioning. But T and surgery still helped me be myself. (Idk if this makes any sense.) 

Anyway, it's been 7 years, I identify as nonbinary and am comfortable with my feminine-leaning androgyny. Currently, I am preparing to go off T (for financial as well as identity-related reasons). While part of me is panicking (the sort of panic I probably should have experienced 7 years ago, tbh), I'm also trying to remember that I can still express my identity regardless of what hormones are flooding my meat-prison. 

My point is, I speak from experience when I say that you do not have to be 100% sure -- is any of us ever sure? -- to move forward. Certainly you should be having the thoughts you are having, and be aware of the permanence of some aspects of transition, but beyond that... 

It took me 5 or 6 years to ""figure out"" my gender identity (as if that's possible), and I have been on T for the duration. Pursue medical transition, and if 5, 10, 20 years down the road you decide that it's no longer a necessary element of your gender experience, then you are free to stop. 

**tl;dr** I don't have any meditative questions for you. I just want you to know that there are infinite ways to do a gender, and for every trans man you can't identify with, there's a gender-weird kid ready to swap stories (hello). 
Not really, because either way, I know I want medical transition to be in the picture. I'm already about to start T, and I do plan on having top surgery because I'm tired of binding and I can't make myself leave the house without doing it. I guess for now, it doesn't matter, because I'm certain of the steps I want to take. I'm just one of those people who do like their labels, I like knowing who and what I am and being able to easily say those things to myself and others. 
I worry about what if I'm wrong all the time. I had a huge panic attack before my first T appointment because I was really unsure if that's what I really wanted. I knew it was, I've been envisioning it for years, but I still had all these doubts and insecurities before going.
I suspect that's probably pretty normal. I mean, pretty much everyone second guesses major decisions. It's good, it helps us make sure that we're really making the right choice. But if you are a certian as you are, sometimes it can just be overactive and stop you from moving forward. "	6mxlqo	NonBinary	12	1.0	2017-07-12 22:52:48
28 AMAB And Married, And Just Now Realizing I'm NB	"I've had so many problems in my life. I've struggled with ADD, Depression, and Anxiety problems, at school and work especially. I've been so focused on powering through the general anxiety that I didn't realize I was casually dismissing any notion of desire to be feminine. I had all kinds of anxious thoughts that I gave full credence to, such as:

* ""It would be insulting to the trans community to just decide I'm trans.""
* ""I don't have crippling dysphoria or hate my male body, so I can't be trans.""
* ""I just want to be trans to get attention.""
* ""Most men would enjoy fantasizing about being women if they were honest and open minded.""
* ""This is all just a feminization kink, and it would be unethical to try to force that on anyone else.""

Big thanks to /r/egg_irl for cracking my shell. I've realized that euphoria I experience experimenting with makeup and women's clothing is valid and more than just a kink. I've realized that I'm really into the idea of being able to present femininely and pass as female at times I could choose, but I don't want to lose the ability to present masculinely either. I don't hate my beard or my body hair, but I'm kind of desperate to see what I look like shaved, made up, and dressed as a woman. I want to know how pretty I can be. I want to learn how to dress well and wear makeup. I really love the idea of going out with friends as a woman. But I don't want to lose the ability of being able to present masculinely when I want to. 

I'm honestly not sure if I will stay genderfluid long term or if this is a stepping stone towards being a transwoman. Right now genderfluid, bigender, or something like that feels right, and I honestly don't think I'm a full on transwoman.

I apologize if this is a dumb question, but I feel like I need to hear it from some actual genderfluid people. Do you consider yourself to be trans? Do you find that others consider a genderfluid person as a type of transperson? How do you go about explaining your gender in public social situations?

It seems like it's a common story for transwomen to go through a phase of considering themselves genderfluid at first. Does anyone have a sense of the ratio of transwomen with that story vs people who remain genderfluid long term? Have you noticed anything that tends to differentiate these people from the long term genderfluid people? 

Also, how do you feel about pronouns? I don't feel like I care right now, although it's a special kind of rush to be called a girl since it's so new. Do you ask people to use different pronouns when you're presenting differently?

Do you present androgynously most of the time, or do you switch back and forth between masc and femme presentation?

-----------------------------

I'm really excited to explore all of this and find out for myself how I can express my femininity in a fulfilling way, but that excitement comes paired with twice as much guilt over what my wife is feeling right now, and her fear for the future. We've both had one individual session with the sex and gender therapist. She's scared that I'll make a full transition one day and she won't be able to tolerate it. She has had many traumatic experiences in her life, on top of an experience of general romantic rejection from men while easily attracting lesbians. For her, I was a man who reinforced her idea that she is a conventionally attractive woman, but this whole revelation has her feeling insecure about her body and feeling like she's not attractive to ""normal men"". Honestly, she does have a bit of a butch vibe to her, and I absolutely love that about her, and it makes me feel terrible that she doesn't feel good about the way that I'm attracted to her.

All that said I think she's taking the whole thing very well, considering that in breaking this news to her I'm hitting all of her insecurities with a sledgehammer. Not to mention that she hasn't fully processed the traumas of (all separate instances in different years) her grandfather molesting her mother, abusive drug dealing parents, eviction from her childhood home, the death of a friend in a car accident in high school, her own rape in college, and a 3 month torturous hospitalization that left her with PTSD. Now she can't help but to see me as her most recent trauma, and further evidence that everyone is out to hurt her. She's been suicidal in the past, and now I have to contend with being the cause of suicidal thoughts that she's having now. She resents not having anyone else to talk to (I've given her permission to talk to friends but she's not really ready to do that) and being around me is making her anxious, so she's going to visit family this weekend.

The whole situation seems really bleak right now, but despite all of that, we're having respectful discussions, and she's comforted by the fact that nothing has really changed yet. She's making an honest attempt to resist her anxious thoughts, and I'm trying to give her plenty of room to vent and not take anything personally at this point. When I showed her a picture I took with lipstick and mascara on, she smiled and admitted I looked cute. She's said she definitely has no problem with men wearing makeup. She hasn't articulated any specific fears she has for the future except that I might transition totally into a woman and she wants to have me as a man.

Further complicating things is that fact that her own traumas have left her unable to really feel comfortable with herself as a sexual person, and since she's also taking libido killing anxiety medications, she hasn't felt up for sex in months. She's barely even sure what she wants sexually, touch in general just makes her feel defensive. That's what we were originally going to couple counselling for before I had my own revelation that introduced all of these complications. The resentful part of me feels like ""Why do you even care how I wanna look if you're not looking at me sexually anyways?"". I know that's not how she feels, and that she is attracted to me, she just has a mental block around sex in general. If anything, the fact that she was ever comfortable enough with me to fuck me says something about how much love and comfort she is able to feel towards me.

I don't know what I'm expecting anyone to say about all this but I don't have anyone else to vent to at the moment. I'm hopeful, excited, scared, and guilty, and  I think I kind of just want to see your reactions to the shitshow that is my life currently."	"Hey! Congratulations on opening up so much excitement about gender exploration! It's awesome that you are so stoked about it.

Gonna match your wall of text with a wall of text, if I may. I'm not married, but I am AMAB and have been in relationships with women who were very dependent on me for validation (to a degree that became deeply unhealthy for each of us), and have also struggled with anxiety, depression, and ADHD-PI, so a lot of what you said felt familiar to me.

I can't pretend to have the answers you need, but based on my own experience I want to encourage you focus on actions and feelings and what makes a positive difference to you in the present, more than on trying to figure out ahead of time where you're going to end up. I've been trying to figure it out for more than a year, and I still don't know whether the best fitting label for me is genderfluid, trans femme, trans woman, agender, demi-something, grey-something, or if someday I'll wind up considering myself a gender-nonconforming cis male whose pansexuality is more important to him than he used to think. If you want to ask more people who identify as genderfluid whether they consider themselves trans, you could try at r/genderfluid. But I want to ask you: why does the ratio matter? You're not a data point, you're a person. You contain multitudes. Finding likeminded people can be wonderful and so can feeling a sense of belonging as part of a larger group, but if you go with an open heart and good intentions you can belong wherever you go. Sorry if that sounds corny, but it's the most important thing I've been coming to recognize lately. I've been extremely lucky in having a cis female friend (who is more gender-conscious and gender-literate than probably any other cis person I know) invite me to a couple of women's groups she attends, which I never would have had the courage to inquire into myself. I have literally never called myself a woman to anyone, but the thing is, nobody actually cares! Once I show up, I'm treated like I'm supposed to be there, and my imposter syndrome slowly starts to melt away. Same goes for trans support groups. I still wonder every time whether I should really be there, and it can be hard to feel a kinship when most people there are either on HRT or pursuing HRT and talking about HRT and congratulating each other on their progress with HRT and I have no idea whether that's a path I want to go down. But nobody else ever acts like I shouldn't be there. So the question I'm starting to ask myself now is how valuable that space and that support and those conversations are to me, rather than whether I'm qualified for them.

Yes, there are a lot of trans women who go through a period of IDing as genderfluid, bigender, etc. And there are also trans women who pretty much know their trajectory the minute they realize they're not cis ‚Äî or who give that impression, at least. But I think that, no matter how your process looks from the outside, when you're the one going through it, there are no shortcuts. For me, there is nothing that proves to me I'm trans and no way to ""know"" that I'm nonbinary. But I do know the feeling of relief I get when introducing my new pronouns and names to a new group of people, or dressing more feminine than I previously allowed myself to, are valuable. I don't feel euphoria, exactly. I don't necessarily feel like there are any ""right"" pronouns or ""right"" looks or styles for me. It's just piecemeal relief and release from the perceived social pressures that I've internalized for the better part of three decades and have messed me the heck up.

All this to say, as a fellow person with ADHD and anxiety, that the disorientation and inconclusiveness you feel may not go away with time. Our brains are better with global thinking than linear thinking, right? So as tempting as it is to try and discover the perfect direction for you so you can follow the formula and feel great about it, it may not work out that way at all, and the search for the best formula might never stop exhausting you. What I'm finding most fruitful to me is focusing on what concrete actions and specific interactions have produced a positive feeling or allayed a negative feeling. This has been helping me feel more like I am grounded, growing, and strong enough to take on major changes in my life.

Pausing to acknowledge that it's completely possible I'm just projecting my own shit onto you and none of what I've word-vomited in the last three paragraphs will apply or be helpful to you.

And so back to you. As far as how to explain your gender in public, you don't owe anyone an explanation. You don't have to teach people who are clueless or find a way to make things sound neat or simple when, based on what you've written in your post, they aren't. I can only speak for myself, but I've been consistently surprised how seldom people bring it up if I don't first. The vast majority of people still read me as male no matter how I present, and the best thing I can do for my own health is to (1) expect that that will be the case indefinitely, and (2) choose who it's most important for me to address it with, how, when, in what situations. I mean, I still get emotionally sidelined by gendering all the time and it fucking sucks, but I've found that reacting defensively or indignantly doesn't really get me anywhere. Prescribing names and pronouns does help, because many people know exactly what to do with that and so they don't feel accused of not knowing enough or not being good enough ‚Äî and because, if they *do* react with confusion or protest, I don't have to take on their reaction; all I have to do is stick to my story. This is my name. These are my pronouns. That's how you refer to me. (Subtext: I'm not responsible for your worldview and in this moment I'm not asking for you to change it any more than in those tiny, tiny ways.)

As for your relationship with your wife, that's a whole lot for you to be navigating with. It sounds like you have an extraordinary capacity for consideration and empathy, as many people with ADHD and/or anxiety do. Have you ever been to an Al-Anon group? Totally regardless of whether your wife is an addict or recovering addict herself, it sounds like it could be worth a try for you. Some areas even have designated LGBTQ-inclusive groups, but it depends on where you are. I'm in a city that's known for being ""liberal"" but out of dozens of groups here there's only one that's specifically queer-friendly. Unfortunately, other groups can be full of older people who really don't get it if you try to bring up gender or sexuality issues at all. But I've found the program helpful.

Wishing you many good things, whatever forms your journey takes! üíú

I'm writing this before reading the rest of your post. I appreciate that you're the kind of person to take a step back and reevaluate your thoughts and feelings, but in this particular instance I feel like you totally understand what I'm going through and I want to read this a thousand more times.

The rest is also great lol. Thank you so much. It's just nice to see someone has gone through this before me. I know I'm not necessarily on your path, but we're struggling with the same things. Can I ask what pronouns you use?

I'm not in any kind of club or group lol. Al-anon sounds like a weird fit for me. I'm happy with reddit and my two therapists for now. My support group is actually great and I have some friends that I really want to bring this stuff to, I think they'd be incredibly supportive. I'm just afraid of having to ""revise my story"" later. If it were me, I'd be out right now, and I'd be talking about everything I'm dealing with my friends, but it's not. I have to really put my wife first and as new and surprising this is for me it's so much worse for her. I want to show her that I'm prioritizing her and not doing anything to make it harder for her to process this news. Our next couples session is on Thur so I'm planning on just not doing any kind of exploration until then, but a lot of thinking and talking.

One bright spot is just the fact that I get to talk about this with her at all. She is my favorite person in the world and I have extraordinary respect for her. She's really scared and anxious right now but I can see how much she's trying to do right by me and come to terms with what's going on, and living in the moment and be comfortable with how things are right now is a big part of that.

The ratio's are important because I want to be able to tell my wife exactly what's going to happen, and what I want to happen, and short of that I want her to have all the information possibly can. One thing she's contemplating right now is whether she needs to leave now in order to now waste her own time trudging through a grueling ordeal for a relationship that needs to end anyway. I don't think it needs to end and I don't want it to, but I want to support her happiness no matter what, If she decides she needs to leave me still want to do whatever is best for her happiness. But I know that she genuinely wants me to be happy too. One of her worries is that she is just sexually incompatible and can't sexually satisfy me. I believe that she will eventually discover the shape and extent of her sexuality as go through couples therapy and I think it might be pretty expansive and open underneath all the shame and trauma. I'm certainly vulnerable to hopeful thinking so I won't pretend like I I know her better than anyone and can predict her future. But I'm really hopeful, and I can imagine a life where even if everything feminine about me is disgusting to her, that I can find other avenues to express it and still feel fulfilled. I'm not confident that I'll always feel that way, but that's how I feel now.

Thank you so much. I'm very drunk right now and I really appreciate you taking the time to write to write every fucking word that you did.

now that i mostly pass as male i don‚Äôt really care what pronouns people who already know me use, i just don‚Äôt like when strangers say she/her/ma‚Äôam because it means i‚Äôm not passing - anyone relate?	"when i finally came out as trans a little over a year ago at 26 after questioning for 14 years, i wanted everyone to use he/they pronouns so i wouldn‚Äôt be constantly reminded that the physical traits that made me dysphoric were obvious to everyone around me. pronouns were a confirmation that my voice was high, my chest was large, my face was round and smooth, my hips were wide and curvy. 

now that i pass as male after T and top surgery, i don‚Äôt really care what pronouns people who already knew me before transitioning use because my dysphoria has largely been alleviated. i‚Äôm just non-binary and all pronouns are pretty whatever to me now. 

anyone else experience this? did you come out again telling people to use any pronouns?"		hxj9r5	NonBinary	11	0.88	2020-07-25 08:16:24
Finally have it figured out	"I just had to post this somewhere because, I feel really at peace with where I am right now.  Over the last almost 2 years, I've really been questioning whether I was a woman or not.  I never had the language to describe the feelings I have had, the discomfort I have being AFAB.  Last weekend, I had the worst dysphoria I've ever had, after having a dream about transitioning and it finally really got me to thinking about why I've been avoiding that I've sort of accepted that I want that transition.

I have always been worried about going on T.  I'm a scientist, I've read what it does, what it changes, I've read what feels like every post of people's stories.  And it really does scare me.  I'm scared of losing my hair, I'm scared I won't like some of the changes and for a while that was enough to keep me from doing so, but the longer I've sat with this body, compensating in other ways, I realize I'm just not listening to what I need.  And sort of having that realization and finally admitting to my therapist that the worst of my dysphoria comes from how my genitals appear to how fat has sat on my body in ways that has ultimately feminized me more over the years (I had a very androgynous look in high school/early college), we finally talked about a timeline.

I'm graduating with a PhD soon, my life is going to dramatically shift into a new job and such.  I currently live with my mom, who I know won't take my gender identity seriously, so I definitely want to move away first and have the space to come out to her and my family before doing anything physically.  I've decided for now that I want to focus on taking care of my body.  I gained a lot of weight due to stress in grad school and I know I don't want all of it to just migrate to new places.  And saying that I will eat better and work out feels to me like accepting that this is the beginning of my physical transition.

It's just really given me a sense of peace over the last couple of days, that I finally have gotten a clear mind on what direction I want to take to feel more myself.  That's all."	"I‚Äôm so proud of you! Continue living your fantastic life, I believe in you!!
Congrats! And congrats on the PhD and the new job! That's awesome. I'm still in I-might-have-an-academic-opportunity phase (graduating with my PhD in another several months) or if-that-doesn't-work-out-I'll-just-leave-academia. I'll only find out once I graduate of course! (grants..)
Don't have a job just yet, but it will happen.  Definitely getting out of academia.  I can't imagine trying to teach, write grants, papers, be on committees and train grad students.

Non-Binary and Perplexed with Conflicting Doctors' Hormone Opinions	"I am 50 years old, AMAB, identifying as third gender.  I had an orchiectomy 2 years ago.  I began estradiol shortly before that, and gradually increased from 1mg to my current 4mg (2mg morning and night) sublingual each day.  The goal has been to change my body to become more neutral-toward-feminine, and I've had some success with that (some breast development, erections very rare, body hair thinning and hope it thins more).  I feel good on the 4mg daily, though I'd be happier if I had more sex drive and stronger fingernails.  I've done all this through private ""civilian"" physicians.  My most recent estradiol level was 212.3 pg/ml.  I do not consider myself ""finished"" with physical transitioning, and I eventually want further bottom surgery once I lose enough weight to get it done.

The Veterans Administration has worked with my civilian doctor and provided my prescription meds.  Recently though, I moved to a new city, and the VA hospital here insists on reviewing everything with their specialists.  They now insist that I see a VA endocrinologist.  The primary care doctor there referred me ""electronically"" to one of their endocrinologists, and he returned a treatment note that was frustrating---both for misgendering and for oddball recommendations:

""Would start with baseline fasting AM total testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH and prolactin. As patient is S/P bilateral orchiectomy, she should not require high dose oral estrogen therapy and no spironolactone. Generally, transdermal estrogen patch therapy is recommended to provide adequate circulating estrogen (30 -70 pg/ml range) while at the same time avoiding first pass hepatic
matabolism and theoretically lowering iatrogenic DVT risk. Will still require screening mammograms every 2 years (is a generally recommended frequency).""

So, clearly this endocrinologist missed the notation that I'm non-binary, NOT female, just for starters.  The fact that he wants me tested for testosterone level is bizarre, given that I'm nearly two years post-orchiectomy.  I'm all for reducing the risk of DVT, as I'm overweight, etc.  HOWEVER, dropping from 212.3 pg/ml estradiol level to a 30-70 pg/ml range sounds like a TERRIBLE idea, especially if I'm still seeking further physical transition.  As I understand it, this would place me essentially at the level of a postmenopausal cisgender woman.

I am getting the blood tests per their direction, and I have to see their endocrinologist soon.  I realize others on here are NOT doctors, but have any of you dealt with similar conflicts in doctor recommendations--let alone such a directed reduction?  Thoughts?  Experiences?  HELP!"	"It might be an idea to lie about being non-binary if they they think those levels are for female. Also the bottom surgery.

Scared to openly identify as NB as ‚Äúbasically‚Äù a trans guy	"Okay, odd title, I know. But hear me out.

I‚Äôve been on a ‚Äúgender journey‚Äù for 5+ years and been though every label there is. At this point, I don‚Äôt really care if I have a micro label that perfectly fits me. I just am who I am and I‚Äôll transition the way I‚Äôll transition. The thing is, the way I‚Äôm transitioning is almost exactly the same as a binary trans man. I came out just ‚Äúas trans‚Äù and I use exclusively he/him pronouns as when people use they/them, it feels like they‚Äôre doing everything they can to ignore the fact that I am trans.

I had top surgery last November and I‚Äôm constantly looking into getting on T. But the best way to describe how I feel about my gender is ‚Äúoff color trans guy‚Äù. Like if ftm was sky blue, I‚Äôm more of a cyan. I‚Äôve got a bit more green in my blue. Point being, I technically fit the definition of being nonbinary. I am not a binary trans man. More like a nonbinary trans man.

But here‚Äôs where the fear comes in:

I don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äúyup, I‚Äôm NB‚Äù and then have people completely disregard my masculinity. I don‚Äôt want to be treated any differently than any other trans guy. I‚Äôm a bit feminine but more in the slight gender non conforming way (flower crowns with my hoodies if you will lol) and I don‚Äôt want people to take that as an invitation to treat me like I‚Äôm completely genderless and neutral. Or, even worse, treat me like I‚Äôm just a girl with short hair when they fully don‚Äôt respect nonbinary identities at all.

Basically, what I‚Äôm getting at and trying to ask/figure out is:

Do I say anything to anyone ever about technically being nonbinary? I like to show my pride in my identity and I recently made some pride frog keychains for my Etsy and I‚Äôm tempted to keep an NB one but I honestly don‚Äôt want people to see that I have one for the reasons mentioned above.

Any advice? What do you all think?

Edit: I am not looking for advice on my identity. I‚Äôm good on that front. I‚Äôm looking to see if I‚Äôll be automatically considered genderless/completely gender neutral if I were to have or show any Enby pride merch and/or tell anyone that I could be classified as such."	"I think context is important to answer your question. Do you have lots of nonbinary folks in your community? Do the people around you understand the language? I would say in general most folks aren't super up on what nonbinary means other than ""they/them"" (and if they are then they'll ask you about pronouns or what that means for you so you can clarify). So if you say ""I'm a non-binary trans man"" then they'll likely latch on to ""man"" because it's the most common term, or they'll get curious and ask. That also tracks for English in general, where the last term is primary and the ones before it are descriptors (like green blue).
Do what makes you comfortable
 

I am a nonbinary trans man. 

I consider myself genderflux, as my gender identity isn't static, it moves on a scale from agender/genderless to male, but my presentation *is* static. I'm always masculine. 

I use he/him and they/them pronouns, but outside of my close friends and partner I exist as a binary trans man... now I never state I'm binary, but I just openly share the man part and nothing else. 

I chose to do this for ease. For less discrimination. For less questions. To allow myself room to be mostly stealth(even if it wasnt 100% correct) Etc. 

But, I choose it because it was what *I* was most comfortable with. 

If being known as nonbinary is important to you, you can be out and open about it. You can be clear that you're a masculine nonbinary person! It might be difficult, but so is hiding part of your identity(or omitting it in my case). Both ways are hard. 

Which way is easier depends on your personal perspective...

In your case, and obviously one post isn't enough to decide what's best for you, sounds like you are saying your presentation is mostly what leads you to relate to your nonbinary identity. You could choose to just be seen as a slightly feminine man. A man who likes x things. Or you could choose to be openly NB and a man. It's up to you which is easier.
Really glad I found this, I feel the exact same way! I've also been on a gender journey for about 5 years now, and already experimented with every micro label there was. Ive been identifying as FTM for the past few, but now that I'm more comfortable in who I am I feel like I can explore the feminine  part of my gender now. I want to be physically masculine (top and T), but on the inside I feel like I'm male with a slight mix of female. I don't want to be seen as genderless either, but I still want to express this part of me. I'm like 80% trans man, 20% nonbinary lol. I present very masculine but I feel like when I transition I'll start letting myself present more androgynous on occasion.
It sounds more like you're a demi-guy than non-binary, at least in the way I use it which is more like neither. NB as a term is kind of confusing because it is am umbrella term but can also  mean you feel like both genders or neither gender or all the genders. Another way you could describe yourself is trans masc/masculine which means someone who is trans and masculine presenting but not necessarily a trans man.
So, are you saying you feel partly masculine, and partially gender nonconforming?
My community is honestly kinda transphobic. Not in the ‚ÄúI‚Äôll beat you up‚Äù kind of way, but in the ‚Äúyou are a girl and always will be‚Äù kind of way. I don‚Äôt know how many people really know about even being trans tbh. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd necessarily go around telling people ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nonbinary‚Äù, it‚Äôd probably be more like you said, ‚Äúnonbinary trans man‚Äù. So maybe people would latch onto that last word.ü§ûüèΩ

Otherwise I usually just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trans‚Äù and let them figure it out themselves.üòÇ But with pride month coming up, I feel like this is the time to embrace my identity somewhat with the pride merch I make.

I am traveling to alaska in a couple weeks though and I‚Äôm partially trying to figure out if it‚Äôll be safe to have any sort of trans or nonbinary stuff on or around me while traveling too, but that‚Äôs a whole separate issue.üòÖ
Thank you for this! What actually leads me to the nonbinary part of my identity is the fact that I‚Äôm not technically a binary trans man. I mention the small feminine parts of my expression (literally no more feminine than your average somewhat effeminate gay man.) to point out that people could use that to disregard how I want to be addressed. (I am very aware that expression does not=identity.)

Like I said in the post, the best way I have to describe how I feel about myself is ‚Äúoff color trans guy‚Äù. Like if a binary man is sky blue, I‚Äôm more of a cyan or teal. I have a bit more green than a binary trans man. And that‚Äôs what would make me technically nonbinary.

Nonbinary trans man is a far more comfortable term to me than ‚Äútrans man‚Äù on its own but when I put that out there years ago, people questioned me and told me I couldn‚Äôt be both nonbinary and a trans man. So I stopped saying that and just would say I‚Äôm trans or transmasculine and let them figure it out.

I understand the omitting part of your identity for the ease of it. I do it literally every day. I just recently, with pride moth coming up, felt like maybe I should let that part be known too, but I don‚Äôt want people to then disregard how I actually identify to instead go ‚Äúnonbinary means neutral! Use they/them! Dress more feminine, you‚Äôre too masculine and not androgynous!‚Äù

That‚Äôs the main issue. I know how I identify. I don‚Äôt need help with that. I just need help figuring out how people would or could react to hearing I‚Äôm technically nonbinary. Would I even want to say ‚Äúnonbinary trans man‚Äù if people will treat me less like a guy if I did so? That‚Äôs the main issue here.

Once again, thank you for your comment and for sharing your experience! I just felt like I needed to clear some stuff up because I don‚Äôt want people here on this post thinking that I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm technically nonbinary because I‚Äôm barely gender non conforming.

I have done hardcore research on gender identity since I was 15 or so and I‚Äôm now turning 21 this year. I‚Äôm ‚Äúfully‚Äù educated on how identity and expression can sometimes be confused for one another and all sorts of identities people may have. I‚Äôm now just looking for stories of personal experiences like yours! So thank you again for that!üíõ It is extremely helpful! /genuine
I‚Äôm glad you could relate! Feeling completely alone in one thing or another sucks so much. I feel similarly about expressing myself differently after transitioning some. I feel like after I get on T, I may wear more feminine colors or feel more comfortable with my hair which has always felt feminine because it‚Äôs so curly. Top surgery already has been a lifesaver in so many ways! Including being able to feel more comfortable in crop tops.üòÖ I still don‚Äôt really wear them out anywhere because I‚Äôm not on T, but at least now I‚Äôm comfortable in them!
As I know it, the definition of nonbinary was anyone who doesn‚Äôt identify strictly as only binary man or only binary woman. Under that definition, I could technically be classified as nonbinary.

I‚Äôm also not looking to find a label or pinpoint a specific identity. I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if I let anyone know in any way that I would technically be considered nonbinary (including random pride merch) are they going to suddenly decide that I MUST be completely neutral and genderless.
No, gender wise, very masculine. I‚Äôm just somewhat gender non conforming in what I like.

I‚Äôm honestly not looking for help on figuring out my identity. Just trying to figure out if people will treat me like I‚Äôm completely genderless if I mention that I‚Äôm technically nonbinary as the definition is basically anyone who doesn‚Äôt exclusively identify as man or woman and I‚Äôm just like a sliver off from a binary man.

I want to be treated as a binary trans man even though technically I would fit under the nonbinary umbrella.
Oh I wasn't trying to say that it was only your presentation. My apologies, I was trying to say as you acknowledged that as a large part of your outward identity and you could (to outsiders) present as that being your identity exclusively. As I go as a binary transman you could go as feminine, but binary transman, neither of us being less nonbinary in reality. It's just what the outside world would know. 

I wasn't in anyways questioning or furthering the discussion about what your identity is, but rather giving more possibilities of how you could allow others to think of it. 

It can be difficult having your masculinity disregarded due to nonbinary identity. I honestly feel like that comes with a lot of educating, and I decided I didn't want to always be educating(do it enough being known as binary trans), which is why I chose not to share my nonbinary part.
Yes! I wanna try out wearing crop tops too, and I made one, but I'm just overall too feminine looking to feel comfortable with it just yet. I wanna try growing out my hair as well, but it'll all have to wait till I go on T.
It kind of has two definitions because it is both an umbrella term AND a term people like me use to describe our identities. Kind of like how trans can be used both for people who are binary trans people and non-binary trans people, or how many people use the word ""gay"" to mean ""queer"" or LGBT but it is also used for men who are attracted to men. Yeah I think if you're labeling yourself as non-binary but lean more masculine and want to use exclusively he/him pronouns people won't necessarily code you as androgenous but they may assume you're comfortable with they/them pronouns which is why I made the two suggestions I made for identifiers that fall under being NB.
I would recommend just telling them, and then asking them to continue treating you the same way they always have
It‚Äôs fine! Thanks again! It is a tough situation for sure, especially if you don‚Äôt want to be constantly educating people. I‚Äôm okay educating people if it means they‚Äôll be more respectful to both me and others in the future but sometimes I don‚Äôt want to have to, especially for anything other than a binary transition because peoples minds around me basically explode just at that.üòÇ
I would grow out my hair for dreads or braids after T but having short hair is much better for me sensory wise. It‚Äôs always kinda hard balancing sensory needs, style, and dysphoria üòÖ
It‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm just not looking to change how I label myself. Thanks for the help!
Maybe a good compromise for you is to have specific people who you know will respect you as a nonbinary man be aware of your nonbinary identity, but complete outsiders(strangers, people you meet once but never again, maybe some coworkers depending on your comfort and support in your work setting, or fellow students with the same stipulations) remain seeing you as binary? 

That way you are having it acknowledged and you can share more in times you feel like educating, but the people who you know will never get it or will struggle and ask a million questions or could potentially invalidate you can remain seeing you as binary for ease? 

It's so hard navigating this type of thing and really is a nonbinary only experience!
Oh yeah same issue here lol. I have really thick straight hair and when it's long it can get to be too much, especially when it's laying on my ear and hitting the side of my face. For now I'm sticking with ol' reliable: the fade.
It is ridiculously hard!üòÇ Is hank you for the advice!

Wanted to react on the detransition Ask-Reddit post (trauma and clumsy transition)	"So the discussion was pretty interesting on this Ask Reddit post, with multiple people talking about the link sometimes with transition and trauma, especially for AFAB people. The comments are done so I wrote one to post here, to testify on my own situation 

¬´¬†Not really de-transition or exTrans. I‚Äôm a 23 y.o born female and as plenty of people commented, indeed I had sexual trauma as a kid. I started a FtM transition when I was 16, clearly unhappy with my life, body, family, how they see me, how people see me, how men see me. I was in total denial of my traumas at this time and decided I wanted to be fully male, feeling it really strong when people didn‚Äôt accepted my new gender and became a pretty aggressive transgender advocate. 

Then I grew up. I was 19-20. Went into therapy for my traumas. Took testosterone (half illegally also). Had changes in my body. My life. Family. Mental health. Jobs. At some point I found my way in life, dream studies, new social environment, where people mostly saw me as a guy. 

At this point, I stopped taking testosterone. Started to wear feminine stuff again. Started to feel seen, understood, valid. I was very indeed, trans, and people see me that way, in the middle. I started questioning my gender again: am I a lesbian girl? A guy? Non binary? But which kind of non binary? Gender fluid, agender, other kinds? 

I realised I was happy with who I am. Being guy or girl didn‚Äôt mattered to me. I still don‚Äôt know what I feel about gender. Just decided that if everyone see me in the middle, and I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm just non binary by fact. I stopped asking myself these question. Going about my life forgetting how people look at me. Didn‚Äôt wanted to detransition neither ending it. I feel free to explore myself in a non gendered way. It gave me, indeed, distance with my trauma, so I can actually really consider it in my life and psyche. 

I can get lot of violence from random people or administration because they just don‚Äôt know the fuck if I‚Äôm a boy or a girl, even having some files against me for identity theft and being both a male and a female for administration. We don‚Äôt aknowledge how much being visibly trans / non binary make people weird when you don‚Äôt have a clear answer to give them else than ¬´¬†neither¬†¬ª 

So here‚Äôs a 23 y.o happy non binary testimony about clumsy transition / de transition¬†¬ª"		sx88dc	NonBinary	10	0.86	2022-02-20 18:48:42
"The transdar vs the terfs ""We always know"""	"This post is inspired by this post and the comments I read there:  https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/zhg9kw/one_of_us/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button


I think we can separate the terfs ""we always know"" from the queerdar. About the queerdar, aka trans/enby/gender queer/etc people recognizing each other: There are clues that people present very deliberately, like putting little flags or symbols somewhere on them, and other more traditional hints as mentioned in the discussion below the Fry meme post. In addition to this I think that when we're longer in a community we probably develop and pick up indeliberate social habits and clues that only other members of the community know and therefore notice. Or a mix of that like for example that many of us are trying to speak very ungendered and are maybe more used to using certain words, like neo-pronounce or stuff associated with transitioning, etc. A person who had similar life experience may be able to pick up stuff like that, leaving eventually this unclear gut feeling of I think this person is part of my community. It's not always perfect but also not non-existent. In opposite to this are the terfs that just can't, because they are not part of the community and do not share these life experiences with us. They are also looking for different things then the transdar. Probably terfs won't notice or understand a little pride flag on someone backpack that is not the rainbow or the trans flag, if they even know the trans flag. Not to speak of even more subtle hints as those mentioned above.. What they do is try to read into someone something that they think are ""biological"" characteristics of that persons sex, and that just doesn't work and also is not at all what the queerdar does. I understand fully that people are scared of being clocked or recognized in public and this is very sad. It is ultimately the result of transphobia, like propagated by terfs. I also understand that this affects the queerdar, which with less transphobia might be a nice thing making it easier to find like minded people. So I don't think we can and should turn it off, but we must use it very carefully. Just my thoughts, any opinions? Very interested in discussing it.

tldr: I think the queerdar and the terfs trying to clock trans people are very different things but we must be aware and cautious using the queerdar because of transphobia, as propagated by terfs.

Edit: Changed from transdar to queerdar, because of the valid point that most of the time if there's not a specific flag or something like that no one can probably tell any specific identities of a person. Queerdar is more vague so probably more what I mean. Can't find an option to change the title, not the most experienced redditer here.."	"I see trans folks everywhere (also likely where they, in fact, are not) but I think it's because I desperately want an IRL community, know it exists in my city, but still have no friends. Wishful thinking I guess.
I‚Äôve seen like one other trans person in my life I knew about. There‚Äôs probably hundreds I interacted with I didn‚Äôt know. Saying you can clock other trans people if you are trans is just funny, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true at all personally.
I found online representation of local groups and reached out to them also online first. It was a lot less scary that way for me (greetings from social anxiety). Then it basically started a cascade of being introduced into smaller and smaller communities and groups. Maybe you can find something similar in your area?
I didn't said I can clock someone all the time or want to, but I bet most of us sometimes meet someone and think ""mmh maybe they're also trans"". To me it happened twice. One time we eventually recognized each other and got around chatting very nicely. Second time it happened to me we started following each other on Twitter afterwards, because of professional reasons and I found a lot of flags in their bio :) Also nice experience. I don't think it works all the time, but I'm also pretty sure it kinda exist and happens to many of us sometimes. Point I'm trying to make is that it's rly something different from the terfs transphobic claims and we should recognize it as that.
when I see someone who looks or sound lgbt I couldn‚Äôt tell you if they are a gay man who‚Äôs very feminine /likes to do drag or a trans woman. They could be either. I would have to be told. I can‚Äôt decide in my mind, so I use they pronouns for the person. When I see someone who looks androgynous /punk I couldn‚Äôt tell you if they are simply a rebel or non-binary. And then there‚Äôs just passable trans woman / trans men who I would never know. If I ever saw a trans man irl I have no idea.
Yes, that's true its not like that you can differentiate that much. Maybe queerdar would be a more accurate word.
Yes and I love when my queerdar goes off. Like around employees at shops and stuff. But I never assume they are trans. I may think for a second then I‚Äôm like nah I have no idea. But there was one trans person I think I saw. I did identify her as trans . It was cool. I wanted to go up and say something but I was pretransition and a shy scared boy moder with no social skills
Love it too! Wanted to differentiate from the gaydar, which probably has it own nuances that I wasn't rly talking about. Like f.e. gay men recognizing each other maybe also for dating purposes, which has a super long history of clues displaying in specific ways, the hanky code, etc..

detransitioned and probably a bit non binary but I'm worried I'm being intrusive	"hello! this might be better suited to r/detrans but i wasn't sure if that's a bit of a transphobic sub or not so didn't want to risk it. 

i have had a complicated relationship with gender (im afab), when I was 13 i started to use they, later he/him pronouns, changed my name with my friends, cut my hair and i guess socially transitioned as much as i could. i never got to the point of speaking to a therapist or doctor about it. at some point i just stopped cutting my hair, defaulted back to she by 16 ish but id constantly have moments of uncertainty where it felt totally wrong. i had bdd around this time which was separate but i was Not an attractive boy, the hair was impossible to maintain, i couldn't bind etc so i just felt ugly & couldn't figure out if it felt Right besides that. i am in my early 20s now, i use she her only, i look/dress pretty feminine. 

i really don't want to appropriate the term or force myself into a community that isn't mine but i believe I felt real gender dysphoria & still occasionally do, it just isn't intense enough for me to need to change how i present, or i just dont have the energy to when it didn't help last time. if i could shapeshift occasionally that'd be ideal, i don't identify with a middle ground/being they/them or looking androgynous necessarily, sometimes I'd just really like to be a man for a bit. and it's fine it doesn't distress me very much. maybe that's just a normal cis experience.

because of my experiences with (possibly) dysphoria and sort of feeling non binary but not wanting to call myself that because of how i present, and having sort of detransitioned, i can't help but subconsciously feel like i have more experience with trans issues than most cis people and that im Part of the trans&nb community. and i dont Like this it feels really intrusive of me. i have a trans sibling who i adore and many friends who are openly nb or trans and because i know so many people who identify in this way i especially need to be careful about treading on toes or speaking over people. i am desperate to be a good ally but maybe some of this is because i still feel like i have a personal stake in trans issues?

i feel like I'm straddling this weird ally/actually part of community grey area and i don't know how i should be using this, if at all. it sometimes feels like my experiences have given me some authority (over 100% cis people) to speak on trans issues, but i don't know if i slip too much into thinking of trans/nb identifying people as 'we' and if i should or not.

basically, if one day in my life i realise i need to be male and transition then I would not be surprised, but also if i live my whole life as female that's also very feasible. i am happy to bumble through life and am not really in a rush to reach a conclusion about my gender, whereas it seems like most trans & nb people have more certainty and urgency. i think this is the main thing keeping me from calling myself non binary, right now it just feels out of order, like how can i as an afab female presenting she her person use the same label as people who actively face prejudice and danger for being themselves. the thought of being a Woman makes me want to vomit a bit but looking and behaving like one feels mainly fine. but maybe thats good old fashioned internalised misogyny

sorry for horribly long post and probably oversharing - would be grateful to hear from anyone who feels similarly but also, id welcome being told where the line is. i am very conscious that to people who don't know me, i would seem like a trender (if that is still a term) who does not belong within trans communities. and that is fine because maybe i don't. i follow a lot of trans influencers etc and educate myself, i dont just pull from my own life, regardless of where i sit i want to help. I've made it sound like i go round shouting about Us Trans People and i definitely don't!! & i don't speak for or or over trans people but when the topic comes up it feels like something that concerns Me and in conversation i am instinctively drawing from my own experiences"	"you could consider genderfluidity :) or just that your identity is fluid and you can identify as however you want at any given point in time.

you could also look up r/actual_detrans if you want a detrans community without the transphobia.

you're always welcome here regardless!
It sounds to me like you belong.  You have trans/nb experience and perspectives and you are still on a journey that might not be over.  You have a desire to share your own perspective without trampling over others.  You sound like a great person and I don't think its all overstepping for you to say you that you have a valid transgender perspective.
Like another user said, read a bit about genderfluid. 
Being non binary is not just not having a gender and not relating at all to the concept (Agender). 
It's everyone that doesn't fit in the gender binary. 
So firstly, you are very welcome here:)
Secondly, things change and that's ok. I told my friends that I want to use they/them pronouns and later on changed to she/they. I'm still learning about what I feel more comfortable with and it's ok for me to want to be addressed completely as he/him (I'm AMAB and present pretty masc) and STILL be nonbinary. 

So again, you are welcomed with a hug and a kiss, you are valid as you are and as you will be in the future!
The idea of ""trenders"" is pretty frustrating.  If you feel comfortable here, I think we're pretty welcoming.
I understand how you feel, I had a lot of queer/trans friends that I felt very close too, I felt very strongly about queer/trans issues, I didn't like a lot of aspects of my AGAB, but I thought of any and all excuse of why I wasn't/couldn't/shouldn't be trans. Here I am 3 years later openly nonbinary, changed pronouns, on HRT, post op, and happier than ever. I remember feeling exhausted with matching some trans experience but not others, being in that state of not confidently cis but not confidently trans either. It can be draining. I remember seeing my trans friends figuring it out and being jealous that I still wasn't sure. People figure things out different and at difference paces, don't compare yourself. All this struggle is part of the process, you'll get there. Progress seems slow and it's hard to tell it's even happening but when you look back you'll be amazed how far you've come. 

Exploring your gender can take a really long time, it can be stressful too. And it is exploring, going back to things that are associated with your AGAB is ok, it's just part of testing the waters of what you do and don't like. You're exploring you don't have to know. 

Ask yourself if you were AMAB how would you feel? Would you be content or would you miss parts of being AFAB? If you were AMAB would you transition? Would you be nonbinary? As you are now, would you feel happier being non binary? 

Non binary can look like anything. You don't have to be androgynous or have to have more masculine qualities than feminine to ""count"". You don't have to look any different that you do right now to be non binary. You don't have to want to transition medically at all. You can ""look like"" your AGAB and still be non binary. If you would be happier being nonbinary, embrace it.
This is an experience that I have not had myself but I've spoken to a bunch of people (who identify as cis) that have said this. Essentially they don't think they are entirely cis but it's easier this way and it doesn't bother them enough to care.

And I'm fine with that because I am not the gender police. (No one is btw). I figure that's in some way not cis and therefore it counts. 

They can use whatever terms they like and I'm gonna respect that. But the fact that you have those feelings and the fact that you are worried about hurting others, tells me you're fine. I would say ""trenders"" probably don't care about being hurtful and that's part of the problem.
Queer is fantastic!
I'm glad you feel comfortable with it:)
I will just say that gender fluid people can change every year/month/week/day/hour/minute and it really varies from person to person:)
you‚Äôre definitely welcome here!! 

I don‚Äôt wanna force labels but perhaps [genderflux](https://gender.fandom.com/wiki/Genderflux)? its sorta similar to genderfluid but not really. 

tbh who cares about labels. just be yourself and that‚Äôs valid as heck :))
thank you for this !! i had a closer look at both subs and it's a shame the big one is a bit of a cesspit. i don't regret that period of my life and it's something I'm glad i tried out :---)
thank you for this ! <3
thank you very much for the welcome !!

im pretty familiar w some labels and never really identified with genderfluid, i think im lacking Fluidity. i don't tend to feel differently day to day/more male or more female on some days it's pretty arbitrary. if i Could shapeshift id probably just do a week on and a week off lol. who knows !! I'm happy to just say im queer really.

things certainly do change and they have for me and that's quite a fun thing sometimes ! when ive had different pronouns it's because that's what fitted at that time and I quite like it that way
thank you - sorry i did not mean to speak out of turn, i would not think of someone else as a 'trender'
thank you for sharing ! I'm glad you figured stuff out and are happy :---) 

my gender and uncertainty around it doesnt trouble me at the moment, and i don't feel like there is a fixed conclusion i can come to about it, at least not now, which I'm really fine with. if one happens at some point that's fine too. i know i am somewhere on the nb spectrum. i feel pretty detached from gender itself to be honest, but i enjoy presenting and performing female and male ness (i just wish i could pass as male occasionally without compromising the things i enjoy about fem presenting the rest of the time). if that makes sense !!

not to give you my life story but i hate having only One life to cram in as much as possible. like i wish i could study every subject and travel everywhere ever etc. so the thought of being only a woman forever makes me restless, it feels like a waste of who i am. sorry that makes it sound really frivolous but it's still frustrating.

if i was to wake up amab tomorrow I'd enjoy it for a bit but I think I'd be upset if it was forever. But if I was amab from the start i don't know if I'd feel any different to how i do now. i dont think i will want to medically transition in any way because it's kind of unwinnable, i like my body mostly but I'd also like to have a different one sometimes. which i cant really but c'est la vie i am happy to be uncertain forever !
i was not actually aware that gender fluid included quite long term fluctuations until now and that actually reflects my experience quite well, very interesting stuff !!! i thought it was really weird of me to feel So male for two years and then kind of fade out of it feels so nice to know that is not uncommon :--) queer is good though i like it and it works for me
that reflects my gender fluid experience pretty well. most of the time I'm gender neutral and when I'm feeling femme I can just dress up a bit, but it would sure be nice to shapeshift male once a month or so! either way, though, you're still enby and still totally welcome in this space ‚ù§Ô∏è
No worries. I didn't think you meant that.
I'm really glad to hear!
I might also relate to gender fluid. I'm figuring so these things now.  
I did present my self as queer yesterday at my work place because I didn't feel comfortable yet to tell them I'm NB.

I'm genderfluid: chopped off all my hair as a guy, now I'm a girl and I don't know how I feel about it	"Cutting off all my hair as a guy was one of the most euphoric things I've ever done in my life. I looked in the mirror and I finally saw myself. It allowed me to explore further into masculinity and was a stepping stone into me changing my name. I would never change it for the world. It's one of the best decisions I've ever made. 

Having said that, I kind of miss my hair. I would never grow it out again, it caused me too much dysphoria, and honestly it's much easier to take care of now that it's basically buzzed, but when I look in the mirror (now that I'm a girl) I kind of feel like something's missing. I used to have really long really curly hair and I find myself looking at old pictures and I don't know what I feel exactly. I don't know how to name this feeling. Has anyone else had the same experience?

Edit: To clarify, I'm afab and I've been a guy for over a year. I've essentially been living like a binary trans guy. I'm gender fluid but my gender switches very very slowly, usually once every several months to 3 years. 

So I was a guy for a long time. And now I'm like transitioning into being a girl, I don't know if I can say that, and everything feels weird and wrong and all of my girl clothes are from a long time ago and they're not my style anymore and I have to completely reinvent myself and I don't have my hair anymore and I just don't know who I am..."	"It sounds like another flavor of dysphoria. Given that your hair is really short, you can easily make use of good wigs when you feel the need. A quality wig makes a huge difference. Hope this helps.
I have this!! One day I buy something because I want to be an elven druidic princess in style. The moment it gets here weeks later, ""why did I buy this? This looks fucking awful, I'm not wearing this because I would never wear this.""

And then rinse and repeat every day of my life.
Wigs when you want long hair. Cropped when you don‚Äôt.  

Problem sorted! 

I love my wig and plan on getting more!!
For some reason my answer is always a mullet and I should really stop recommending it to everyone... But here I am again recommending a mullet.

Why? Because it's neutral and versatile. You can have a mullet both on femme days and masc days, it reads as feminine or masculine depending on how you and your outfit looks.

Besides that, it's quite easy to work with dysphoria wise. When I have dysphoria because my hair is getting too long I can easily stuff the long part of the mullet into a beanie or hat and it'll still look natural/intentional. If you have dysphoria bc it's too short or not feminine enough, you could either grow it longer in the back, or switch from a mullet to a shag; They're quite similar hairstyles so you won't have to grow out your hair for years. (Also shags are more femme imo)
Wigs.
A few non-hair options‚Ä¶ Do you have your ears pierced? You could experiment with big, dangly, colorful, or otherwise fun earrings, especially because they won‚Äôt get hidden or tangled in long hair!

Also, clips, headbands, and handkerchiefs/scarves could help depending on the length you have! I like my short hair because I can keep it messy, slick it back, brush it to the side, or shape it a bit more with a cute headband or my curling iron. 

And of course‚Ä¶ a good ole beanie for when it‚Äôs just not behaving"	sj9r6n	NonBinary	12	1.0	2022-02-03 04:23:38
Am I NonBinary? Warning: Long - Questions Welcome	"It's coming upon the end of a the 2010s, and I've felt like I might be non-binary for a while, but I kind of want to decide once and for all before the year is out. So, much like I've answered many questions on the r/asexual, I'm going to describe my experiences and feelings as best I can here, and see how well they line up. Also, since I will be speaking from my own experience and doubts, please know that I don't mean anything as offensive, or doubting to the identities of others. Also, I understand that gender expression and gender identity are two different things, but I will be discussing my gender expression as it can be an indicator. 

&#x200B;

I am AFAB, and have never been really feminine. Growing up, I never really learned how to do make-up, or deal with long hair, but a lot of that had to due with emotional abuse. My grandmother (my grandparents raised me) was the kind of person who would criticize, but not really teach me to improve. As I got older she had to bribe me to do things like get my eyebrows waved because, ‚ÄúThey're growing together!‚ÄùI hated girly clothes because of the shame cycles associated with buying them. I've always been overweight, and so it always felt crappy. I hated the extra time that things like make-up and long hair took to deal with. 

  
 I also hated being a woman for a long time. I hated having periods that were sometimes so bad that I had to skip class. I disliked having boobs because they kind of get in the way. But other than that, I hated the social expectations put on females. I hated that my emotional intelligence was expected to be higher, when I've always been socially awkward, not to the point of autism, but some of the social issues associated with ADHD and just lower emotional intelligence in general. I hated that being overweight is always seen as worse in women, even though all genders experience social BS from it. Once I realized I had ADHD, I resented that it wasn't caught sooner because I was a girl and wasn't hyper like my dad was. I hated how some people had doubted my intelligence or ability in the past or else felt like I only got ahead because I was a woman, even though there have only been a few examples of that in my life, thankfully. I hated that I already had mental illnesses that made my life difficult, but this thing I couldn't really change just added to that. But again, most of that isn't so much hating my gender as hating the way I'm treated by society because of my gender.

  
 However, at the same time, I didn't want to transition to being male. For one thing, men have a ton of BS standards on them too that didn't fit me, and frankly, I know that the BS of being a woman is nothing compared to what trans people go through. So I don't really want to put myself through that. Also, I'm kind of fine with she/her pronouns, because that's what I'm used to now. The times I've been misgendered, once or twice when I worked at Subway and once by a professor in class, I wasn't terribly insulted. I was surprised the first time, but when the professor did it, I remember my friend was more angry on my behalf than I was. I was just like, ‚ÄúMeh, I was in the back, and I look a little masculine, and maybe his eyesight is crappy.‚Äù  

  
But a lot of this has changed over time. Now that I'm with an amazing woman who loves me unconditionally and reminds me that she thinks I'm gorgeous every day, I've come to accept myself better, including my female anatomy. She loves long hair (on both men and women), and I've agreed to keep it long, so long as she cares for it for me, because I can't stand her sad face whenever I mention cutting it. She isn't repulsed by the facial hair I grow due to chronic illnesses, though she does help me shave it because the way it grows wouldn't look great even on a male-presenting person, and she even thinks my faint mustache is cute.

  
 In writing with her, ironically in male characters, I've realized I do like pretty things. I like ballgowns and bright colors, and while I have no interest in buying them, I can admit that side of myself. However, whenever I dress in bright colors and really put in effort, I often feel like I'm just wearing a costume. And I also don't think liking pretty things, or any of my other interests, should be just male or female interests. I love musicals, video games, writing, sci-fi, fantasy, etc... but none of that should be gender specific.

  
 I feel like if I woke up with a penis tomorrow, I wouldn't be terribly fussed about it, except for the scientific concerns. When I play characters in stories or video games, sometimes I play men, sometimes I play women. I feel like my gender isn't a big part of me either way. I don't have a big interest in presenting more androgynously because I've developed a style I think is often separate from gender, and well.... I still don't like putting tons of effort into my clothes, make-up, and hair. I have given serious thought to a more gender neutral name, something that can be for either gender but is typically more often seen on males. Like, the opposite of Lindsey. Problem is, Alex is my mom's name, and that's got emotional baggage. And Sam is my love's name, so that would just get confusing. 

  
So, basically, am I non-binary? Or do I basically disqualify myself by not caring enough to really express it in any meaningful way?

  
 I know this was super-long, but I wanted to get out everything I can remember right now. Thanks for reading if you got this far. I'm sure I forgot stuff, because covering 27 years of experience is difficult, so feel free to ask me any questions that might help.   
 

Thanks all, and Happy New Year."	"hey this may sound rude but you don‚Äôt need this big essay on if you are nonbinary, Not completely a woman? Not completely a man? Awesome You are üè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàüåàNONBINARY üåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

seriously tho, there‚Äôs no right way to be nonbinary. if you feel like you are then you are :)
No one can be 'disqualified' from being nonbinary / trans. You don't need to justify your gender. All that matters is what feels right. Do you feel right thinking of yourself outside the gender binary? Then you're nobinary. 

There's no correct way to express your gender, and you don't need to be super androgynous to be nonbinary. I'm a trans guy, and in my day to day life I have no problem with people assuming I'm a binary man. I don't really feel like one all the time, and people I'm close to know I'm a nonbinary guy, but I just present and a slightly effeminate dude. Your nonbinary identity can just be for you if you want -- expressing it outwardly isn't a qualification. Presentation =/= gender. 

Just focus on your feelings. There's no ""correct"" answer, just what's right for you.
Non-binary is simply being outside the gender binary norms. You are outside that, so you are non-binary.

How you feel about that and what you do with it will be unique to you as an individual. 

We're all very different, the only thing non-binary people are guaranteed to have in common is that we don't conform to gender norms. It's in the name. We're very diverse.

There are niches and sub groups/labels. Discovering those might be interesting for you, it might help you answer questions about yourself. Exploring the non-binary spectrum takes time though. You've discovered what you're not, now you can discover, create, and define who you are.
I guess its something I've been thinking about for a while and I was afraid of being seen as a poser, claiming a label I haven't ""earned."" That's why i just laid it all out.
Ive looked into the basic labels. Sometimes I feel gender-fluid, sometimes I feel agender.
Some people might throw something like that at you someday. But they're wrong. Brush it off and stay positive if it ever happens. 

Nobody else can define your gender for you, and you have no obligation to present a certain way, use certain pronouns, or anything else they might try to push on you.

Be yourself, present how your comfortable presenting, use the pronouns you feel fit you."	egqgh1	NonBinary	10	0.92	2019-12-28 12:56:27
My Egg Cracked	"I've been on Estrogen & Spiro since the start of the last administration, probably the hardest and scariest years of my life if I'm being honest... But if I'm also being honest I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I identified as a *Binary* trans woman for those years entirely because I was terrified of exploring my gender, the binary made me feel safe.... But it wasn't me.

My Enby egg cracked a month ago and I've started using She/They pronouns, Scrolling through wiki's and looking at the definitions of words that fit how I saw myself in reference to my Transition and how that related to my end goal... But I think (And what's probably the most non binary vibe ever) I'm more comfortable with creating my own term for my own experience.

Femby is a term I've coined for my experience, That being the experience of someone who was AMAB, Transitioned In their 20's and who wants bottom surgery. See, I love femininity and womanhood but I'm not so in love with societies definition of what those should mean, how someone transitioning should present or how we should relate to those words.

My transition (up until this point) been about blending in with Cis Women and adopting the Binary, but I undeniably started to feel suffocated by those little boxes society wants and trying to defend myself from the terfs /gender critical folks who chronically wanted me to defend my right to exist in a comfortable way.

Last month I had enough. No notable trigger, I just stopped caring about the rules, the expectations, the stereotypes and stealth and I've started just allowing myself to vibe as me.

A Femby Country Singer, Singer / Songwriter, Old as hell millennial with a great Girlfriend."	"Glad you were able to find something that felt right with you. Femby sounds mad cool. It inspires me to come up with my own word. I'm AFAB and I do consider myself an enby but I also don't feel like it totally covers how I feel. Think I'm somewhere floating around between being enby and a trans man. 

Thanks for the inspiration, maybe I'll find my word someday. Or not, maybe I'll just exist as genderless blob üòÄ
That's valid ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Personally I just got tired of other people telling me who/what I needed to be inorder to be ""Trans enough"" to be seen as ""one of the good ones"" and I just kinda decided that I'll create my own identity to describe my femininity.

You're just as valid my friend. If you want to make your own word, do it. It'll piss off the TruScum and that's always worth it."	p0cwk2	NonBinary	11	1.0	2021-08-08 11:20:09
Top Surgery?	"I've been seeing top surgery posts lately and as I identify as nonbinary and given my own feel of gender identity and expression I never really saw the need for it. But as I go on with experimenting different expressions there are days when I wish I didn't feel so dysphoric because of my body. I don't plan on getting top surgery any time soon, or maybe at all, but I'm curious as to other's thoughts on any transitional surgery. Would anyone care to share their experience or thoughts?

Edit: Could people that are comfortable sharing also what made them or why they decided to get surgery?"	"Hi! I just had top surgery around three weeks ago! Here is my experience and thoughts:

Tldr I'm so happy I got it! I feel like a whole new person. Like I really feel like myself. Im having a few complications with the insurance, but overall has been a painless experience.

I had a total mastectomy with free nipple grafts (no upward incision). I used to be a double h and felt a lot of back pain, couldn't wear buttoned shirts without pinning the chest closed, always felt self conscious exercising, my skin actually was starting to break down, it was... A lot. Plus on top of that I had a lot of dysphoria about them too.

Since the operation I have literally felt so much better. I am actually  excited to start exercising once I'm all healed, my shoulder and back pain is non existent, and feel about 1000 times more confident in myself. It truly was like night and day. I will say in the second week I started (I'm not sure how to describe it) almost tricking myself into thinking I regretted it. It's a huge and permanent change, and I think my mind was so scared I would regret I tricked myself into regretting it. That has since passed and now I can't help but smile whenever I look at myself - which is a huge change from before.

I am currently facing some issues with insurance. Basically we decided to run it through as a complete mastectomy rather than the alternative option of a breast reduction. We were given incorrect information from an agent that I wouldn't need prior authorization and went through with the procedure. A week after the surgery I recieved word they did need prior authorization which by that point was too late to submit. We are now appealing for them to cover it. It's a bit nerve wracking not knowing what kind of ill I'll be saddled with. Could be in the range of 5-8k or 20k. 

The surgery and recovery itself went amazing. For context I'm 22 and pretty healthy besides being a bit overweight. I'm recovering super well and my bf and mom have been helping me with everything I can't do. I would recommend if you're thinking of getting this procedure done, go with a breast surgeon and not a plastic surgeon. My surgeon told me about how medical surgery scars are often much finer and smaller than plastic surgery scars. She was also able to help me with how I wanted to look afterwards much more than a plastic surgeon would have been able to. She actually was able to take my excess skin and wrap it around my clavicle to create a pec without being completely flat. I look so natural. She also was able to prevent dog earing (excess skin around the armpits) so I probably won't have to get revisory surgery.

I would say that this has definitely kind of awakened more masculine feelings in me and I can't tell if that's a gender identity thing or presentation thing. I used to id as a Demi girl - you know not totally a woman but definitely related to womanhood in a way. I still feel that way but now I just have more questions about my relation to manhood. Obviously though these gender feelings are all very personal and just my experience.

I hope this helps! I know this is kind of long, but truly it's a big thing and there's lots to consider. I think if you're genuinely interested in getting it done you've definitely taken the right steps in asking for others experiences. If you have any other questions feel free to send me a message :)
I'm very much transmasculine (I identify both as NB and as a trans guy), and I got top surgery but not T. I'd known I wanted top for the entire time I've known I was trans/NB, which is more than a decade. Very happy with my decision so far.
honestly I've wanted top surgery since before I even had the language to identify as NB. As a teen I read a novel called *The Book of Lonely*, it has a cis female character who was terrified of breast cancer and had a prophylactic mastectomy. It was a total revelation moment, I was like ""wow you can do that?! I'm going to do that!""
Thanks for sharing, I've been thinking about this off and on a lot recently, more on than off tbh and you've raised some interesting points for me to think about
I‚Äôve always hated my boobs as soon as I got them. I didn‚Äôt like how they looked and I didn‚Äôt like how they felt on me. They were a massive source of dysphoria, they felt ALIEN, like they didn‚Äôt belong. So I pursued top surgery. I had the massive privilege of being able to pay for my procedure privately. Insurance wasn‚Äôt helping, because they wanted me to recover from depression before making the decision however not making the decision was making me super depressed so it was a frustrating catch-22. 

Once the breasts were off, oh man, it felt SO GOOD. It felt natural, like this was how I should‚Äôve been all along.

This is just my experience, however. I know plenty of nonbinary people who don‚Äôt have a problem with their boobs or even like their boobs. You should pursue whatever feels right to you. There‚Äôs no rush, either, the journey to discover your gender (or lack of gender) is a long, ever-evolving one.
I'm not OP though I have a question - might seem stupid - once having the mastectomy, is there ever a chance of them 'growing back', especially without T?

This is something that I'm concerned about because they're basically made of fat and I am a bit chunk.
Thanks for sharing your experience. I do want to ask, if I can, what was the push for you to get the mastectomy and not a reduction?
Lots of people get top surgery without T. Except in very rare circumstances, nothing grows back after top or a reduction. There was an article about a woman who got a reduction and her breasts grew back, but that was published because it was so unusual and noteworthy.

Double incision removes breast tissue (but not all breast tissue unlike a cancer-related mastectomy) and also fat, and often includes some liposuction.
Haha I understand where youre coming from! It does depend on the procedure and your body. With a complete mastectomy, like what I had, all the breast tissue is removed and will not multiply, meaning you will never grow any more breast tissue. I've heard with breast reductions, however, they can grow back, thought usually not to the original size.

That being said, there is still fat and muscle in your chest and depending on your shape you may have large pecs after a complete mastectomy. For instance, while technically I am ""flat"" (as in, from the side I look flat) I do have a bit of a ridge where my stomach ends and pecs begin. I can send you a pic if you want to see what I mean.

But with a complete mastectomy, even without t, you will never grow breasts back. And while you may have larger pecs, they will never look like boobs (unless you have a very very unique body!), but rather like pecs. I hope this answered your question!
I don't know how to answer this question besides its just what I wanted! Ive never ever wanted to have boobs so it wasnt even a question for me. I wanted them gone plain and simple.

Also, I feel like its easier to be ""fluid"" when you're flat chested. Without breasts you can easily present masc, or pack a bra and present fem. With breasts you have to bind, which can be very uncomfortable, or in my case impossible, to present traditionally masc. 

Let me know if you have any other questions!
Thank you :) I had no idea it was an option without HRT until very recently so it's all new to me!
Yes, thank you!  That does answer my question!  I recently got into weight- and power-lifting so if I ended up with slightly larger pecs, at least I could work with that through strength training to try and get them more muscular :)

I only found out mastectomy was even an option for nb folk recently and can't stop thinking about it now.  I can't bind so I'm also scared any doctor will look at that fact and tell me i'm not serious enough.
Thanks so much! I actually just posted an ask about binders so I can better experiment with that.
I have never worn a binder in my life and I got the procedure done! A good understanding surgeon shouldn't care nor ask!
See, I'm in the UK and can't afford a private surgery so I'd have to go the NHS route, which from other people's experiences sounds harrowing to say the least.
Oh man, that sucks :( I wish you the best of luck!!
Thank you :) and thank you for sharing and answering my questions!"	cap8lj	NonBinary	10	1.0	2019-07-08 18:56:02
"Relationship Trauma and ""lacking"" masculinity"	"ü§ó Hello. 
My first relationship was 8 years ago, i was 16, and dated a girl that had( and to this day has) relationships exclusively with cis men. We were in love but she did things like secretly dating a boy ( tall, muscles and all) while we where togheter to kiss him in front of me later üíî. She broke up with me after 2 years, because she was someone who was very concerned with her social status and told me she needed to have ""a man by her side"". This literally killed my heart and to this day it is one of the worst  emotional pains i can remember.
 ( I am someone who uses he/him pronouns and overall i feel closer to masculinity than femininity, even if i am gender neutral)
After that i had some short relationship but nothing serious, and then i finally came out and started transitioning.
I've been in a relationship for 2 years now with a woman i think is the love of my life. She talks about her sexuality as queer cause she dated girls, boys, non binary and trans  people. That said all of her long (over 5 years) relationships have been with cis dudes. The other day after sex she told me ""she would like me to fuck her on the kitchen counter"" or mentioned that she would like to see me with short hair ( i have long hair and really care about them). I can't help but panic, and even if i know that she loves me for who i am this affirmations leave me feeling like i lack the masculinity that maybe she desires,cause i am pretty gentle in sex and i am not someone who pushes people into walls to fuck them. Then i cry and  am depressed for days cause i am convinced that the story will repeat and she will leave me for a cis dude  , and this fear is so real i can't stop stressing about it...
Can we share experiences? I would like to hear from other non-binary people and feel less alone in this..."	"Hey friend, it might be hard but talk to your partner. This is about how YOU feel, so make sure to use ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements when you do. You might just start by saying you‚Äôve been feeling insecure, even if that insecurity isn‚Äôt reflected in your current relationship, it made an impact on you previously. Communicate with her, and give her time to process too.
Finally consider this, she‚Äôs with you because she wants to be, not because she has to. Your insecurities can stop you from developing deeper relationships because they stem from fear (and it‚Äôs a valid fear). But obviously they see something in you, and so express yourself but don‚Äôt put that insecurity on her either. In the end, you have to love yourself before you can love others, lest you end up relying on your partner for happiness (which can be super toxic).
You are love and valued, tell her how you feel and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll feel better!
[deleted]
maybe masculanity is much more than that being tall or muscles etc.. I think you should try to gain stability, productivity, a willpower which last despite all the difficulties and you should offer this qualities to your partner. I am also very self consciousness because of my lack of masculanity and this is my only way to solve that problem. Its hard for me but I‚Äôm trying.
Thank you that is very good advice üòΩ
Thanks for sharing üê±"	y9wrb1	NonBinary	11	1.0	2022-10-21 15:34:14
I don't know what to do, I just wore makeup around my mom and it led to a whole fight	"I'm home over the summer, me and my mom keep having 'debates' over my transition. I was feeling shitty last night and put in some makeup to help. I end up having to go toher room she's currently in a state where she can't do much by herself, recovering form surgery, and when she sees my makeup she flinches. It's not pleasant but I expect it so whatever I go back to the living room and I'm just handing out on my phone until eventually she calls me again for something I go back and I don't even really remember exactly how the conversation goes I just remember that it leads to her saying out of the blue ""do you think that looks good on you"" I try to walk off but it ends up leading into a conversation that lead to an argument that leads back to a conversation again little hurtful things sprinkled throughout like ""I will never get used to you wearing makeup"" I said some hurtful things too implying that she doesn't care for me.

But I also brought up that she's the one who started the argument by bringing up makeup in the conversation rather than just ignoring it and treating it like normal.

She said I instigated the argument by wearing makeup but was I supposed to do just magically remove it with a snap of my fingers.

She implied that ignoring it would be lying to me or something.

And the conversation went on and on and on and wasn't cuz Austin going from guest makeup to my transition in general it was pretty awful when she wouldn't let me leave the conversation I didn't want to argue yesterday was Mother's Day and I was already feeling dysphoric which was the reason I was wearing the makeup in the first place.

She could have just ignored it she didn't have to say anything.

I have make up on now since I'm going to school to turn in my key and she says me wearing it is ""not respecting her feelings""
She was going to go with me since she had something to do there but said she was going driver own car because she couldn't be with me with makeup on 

(I also feel like I should know that I constantly get compliments on how I look with makeup and am told it looks good on me)"	"Parents are often idiots. We're all here if you need support and advice.
She's being an asshole and I hope you can get away from her soon
Oof my mom was like this when I first started transitioning (ftn). Saying all sorts of shitty comments like ""I thought you loved your breasts"" and ""are you doing that for some boy"". Like Uhm, why the fuck??? Like maybe that's what you would do, but not me sis. I'm doing this for me. I hate it that parents can't just think of their children as little indivuals instead of extensions of themselves. Like maybe I'm not you, huh? Ever thought of that one before? Maybe I hate all the things you love, just by virtue of existing. It never seems to occur to them that they have no say in what you do after you hit that age wall. They just keep pretending like you'll always be their precious little pet, and then act betrayed when you tell them you want nothing to do with them because they never listened to you. I'm so sorry, I hate that we should be forced to go through these shitty things..."	um4qcd	NonBinary	10	0.92	2022-05-09 23:43:34
New&confused	"Hello! I am new to Reddit and identifying as non-binary and just looking for some support. I guess it‚Äôs more of a rant so apologies in advance.

I‚Äôve always felt some sort of ‚Äúoff‚Äù about my gender, or rather, my presentation/expression. I am AFAB and in general haven‚Äôt minded using she/her or being called a woman. I have identified as a lesbian for the last 7 years and feel pretty comfortable with that community. 

For years I couldn‚Äôt quite find my footing. I dressed fairly feminine in hs, a mix in college before slowly skewing more towards masculine clothes, but that didn‚Äôt feel right either. In the last few years, I‚Äôve been more comfortable in the middle, dressing slightly more androgynous. I am definitely read as a cis woman, maybe a lesbian if anything. 

I‚Äôve had thoughts and quirks for years that I either didn‚Äôt notice or thought they were crazy. Every time I try on an outfit or a new piece of clothing for many years I instinctively compress my boobs to my chest to see what it would look like flat chested, and immediately feel relieved. I am so envious of men with flat chests and women with small boobs. I recently bought a compression bra that has felt amazing, but I think I‚Äôve resisted wearing only binders/sports bras because it doesn‚Äôt make me feel sexy and also maybe makes me feel less desirable as a lesbian (?). I can‚Äôt tell if my desire to be feminine is genuine or because it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve seen myself and wanted to be seen by partners.

But when I would see boys who dressed feminine, that was when I felt the strongest desire and admiration, but not in a romantic way necessarily. But I thought it was crazy to be a woman who wanted to be a feminine boy/andro person. And I was confused because I thought to myself, ‚Äúif I like looking feminine, why does it feel so goddamn uncomfortable when I do it now? Why do I want to wear a bra with a flat chest but hate wearing one now?‚Äù I came to the conclusion (helped immensely after reading posts where others felt the same) that when I dress feminine now, I‚Äôm read and see myself as a cis woman, whereas I‚Äôm most comfortable being seen as an androgynous, non binary person who can embody masculinity and femininity at different times to different degrees. 

The thing I have been most stuck on right now is the thought of top surgery. The only reason I‚Äôve come to all these realizations in the first place is I let myself imagine getting a breast reduction, and the thought of top surgery crept into my head, and I frantically googled things like ‚Äúlesbians getting top surgery‚Äù to try to figure things out. But if I got a breast reduction all I could imagine was the doctor telling me how small they could make my boobs and feeling disappointed that my chest wouldn‚Äôt be flat.

When I came out as a lesbian, I actually came out as bi. Not because I was attracted to boys, but because I felt like it gave me some remnant of heteronormativity and I was scared of just being a full-blown lesbian and the shame associated with it. Later, I couldn‚Äôt even imagine why I did that, I was so comfortable and grateful to be gay. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm doing the same thing now‚Äî I‚Äôm fighting the idea that I could actually be non-binary and might want top surgery because it just feels too overwhelming, even though it also feels right. I suppressed admitting to myself I was a lesbian until my best friend basically asked me point blank because she knew, and I‚Äôve often looked at NB people w/ top surgery and thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that type of person‚Äù. But I think it stems from fear and stigma more than anything.

I never have overwhelming chest dysphoria‚Äî on good days I can recognize that I look beautiful, but they still just feel like they‚Äôre just ‚Äúthere‚Äù, not a part of me. But while i don‚Äôt hate my boobs all the time, when I get dressed, I‚Äôve really never once enjoyed how I look with my boobs showing even the slightest. There are so many things, including feminine things, I think I would love to wear with a flat chest. Also, in a weird way, top surgery just feels like it would restore my body to ‚Äúneutral‚Äù, like a blank canvas I could do anything with. I think I would even love having longer hair more with a flat chest. 

I think part of my issue is the trans narrative that is perpetuated that you have to hate your body to want surgery. I don‚Äôt mean to dismiss anyone who feels extreme dysphoria, but I think a part of my brain feels like I‚Äôm not trans enough for it, or that I have to despise myself to want change, which I know logically isn‚Äôt true. But I guess a tiny part of me is worried about regret? But when I think about it, I‚Äôve spent so much more time being envious and fantasizing about a flat chest than I have really genuinely loving my boobs (probably a sign that I used to wish I had a medical reason to get a mastectomy bc then I could get the surgery without explaining anything).

I know it‚Äôs nothing I have to decide right now, but I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed thinking about it, and the fact that I haven‚Äôt really come out to anyone. I‚Äôm lucky in that I know everyone who I care about will support me, but I think I‚Äôm most worried about telling my gf. Even telling her about a breast reduction was difficult, and she said she‚Äôd support me but (half jokingly) as long as I didn‚Äôt go all the way and remove them. I think she was worried (speaking generally) about a partner transitioning to a trans man (which I‚Äôm not), so I‚Äôm not sure how she‚Äôd feel about me being NB, but I‚Äôm worried it won‚Äôt align with her lesbian identity. It‚Äôs hard bc I still want to ID as a lesbian, or soft butch or whatever, which I know I can, but it‚Äôs more complicated in a relationship.

If you‚Äôve read this far, I‚Äôm very impressed, this is the first time I‚Äôve put all these thoughts down. All I can say is, after finding a few non binary people on Instagram and desperately searching for people who looked the way I imagined myself, and found this Reddit and the beautiful pictures people post and the words written I thought only existed in my head and the support people give each other, my heart has swelled immensely. I can‚Äôt wait until I can fully embrace myself the same way."	"Also a new somewhat confused enby here! I feel that if you have given the situation this much thought and feel so strongly about it then top surgery is probably for you and by the sounds of things I doubt you will have any regrets with that situation but sit with it as long as needed to make the choice with full confidence. It can be difficult finding your place as a enby I for one would like to go on estrogen but I dont want breasts so im kinda out of luck there im lucky enough to have great feminine legs and butt so that balances my figure out enough to feel okay with my situation. Good luck on your 
Journey!!!!
Thank you so much! Yeah, I agree, and am happy to hear you‚Äôre also figuring out what feels best for you. Best of luck to you too!"	l8ece7	NonBinary	8	0.91	2021-01-30 05:01:29
Anyone have any issues with the terms AFAB and AMAB?	I‚Äôm realizing how polarizing these terms actually are. While it‚Äôs understood that one may need similar perspective whilst questioning their assigned gender/ transitioning is totally normal. I understand this. But we begin to generalize and objectify people when we say.. ‚Äú all AMAB do this or AFAB do this .. We all have unique experiences. please be careful... I swear we just use it as a way to call someone a boy or girl sometimes which we aren‚Äôt. Also.. Maybe this is just me but I seem to only get AMAB friends here which is nice but it can feel like I‚Äôm not welcome in certain spaces because of my AGAB, that could be me! But do others feel this way too? It‚Äôs not all harmful but I‚Äôm curious how others feel about these terms and it‚Äôs impact on the community	"I don't have an issue with the terms or with people using them to contextualize their own experiences. 

I have an issue when people use them to make inappropriate generalizations.

Afab and Amab are not body types. There are amab people with breasts, there are afab people with penises. Not all afab people menstruate.

Afab does not mean ""is read visually as a woman"". Amab does not mean ""is read visually as a man"". There are amab nonbinary people who pass as women. There are afab nonbinary people who pass as men. There are nonbinary people of every asab that don't pass as cis.
This very much. I think it is useful to contextualize and to talk about gender affirming care, but irl I think there is a lot more shared experiences. I‚Äôm in a support group now where everyone else is amab and despite this it has been incredibly helpful because we do have so so so much in common.
wait hold on.... how can an afab person have a penis? genuinely asking, not to be offensive or rude
because doesn't the doctor go ""well that's a vagina so we put F on the birth certificate""?
This is well put , thanks for taking the time to share!
I see this as well and feel the same. Thanks for the reply :)
Well there are several types of botton surgery, such at metoidioplasty and phalloplasty. In addition, taking testosterone (or having natal testosterone puberty for some afab intersex people) usually has the effect of ""bottom growth"", where the clitoris grows in length and width, typically 1 to 4 cm.
ohhhh that! sorry. I thought you meant afab people who were born with penises. sorry! I get it now. u make a good point in the original comment!!

how do i come out to my family as non-binary after i previously came out as a trans man?	"gender is something i‚Äôve always struggled with to find my identity, and i always knew i‚Äôm not a woman (afab). i came out as trans to my family, most of them being very supportive, but a lot of them just referring to me as ‚Äúhe‚Äù and ‚Äúson‚Äù ‚Äúnephew‚Äù ‚Äúgrandson‚Äù ‚Äúbrother‚Äù etc etc. it‚Äôs still not who i am as a person. i don‚Äôt feel any connection to a gender in particular, which is why i feel i fall under the non-binary spectrum, maybe genderqueer, agender, either way i like going by they/them pronouns and not caring about gender roles. my family is the type to be very traditional regarding gender roles, whether with clothes, makeup, hair, colors, etc. i want to medically transition (testosterone, top surgery, and a hysterectomy) but still be able to express some ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù appearances such as dresses and makeup and such.

i just have no idea how to tell my family without them thinking i was ‚Äúnever trans all along‚Äù even though non-binary is still trans"	"as long as you're comfortable with your family (ie: willing to share personal stuff without too much fear of judgement) i think that a solution to this could just be a long talk. you just have to make sure they understand that your relationship to gender is a lot different than theirs, and hope for if not understanding, at least respect. 

i actually had a similar problem, as i first came out as gay before coming out as non-binary and demi-pan. i was so worried that they were going to judge me for ""doubling back"" or whatever but it seems pretty ridiculous in hindsight now. if they care enough to respect you now, then i'd bet they'll respect you enough to hear you out and at least try to understand. 

just make sure they understand that they won't always have relevant advice or experience, and that they won't always be able to understand fully. emphasize what you want, and what makes you comfortable, and if they care, they'll listen. it might take a while of explaining though, but it should help. open communication can solve a lot!

hope this helps, and good luck with your transition!
Try not to stress out. It's cool to like boy and girl things."	11t9qiu	NonBinary	10	1.0	2023-03-16 23:18:24
I just realised..	"Bit of a back story but important.. I came out as lesbian at 18. I‚Äôve only ever dated women (but slept with the odd cis male) and are attracted mostly to cis &amp; queer females. However for a very long time I felt so uncomfortable about how I often look at a cis man‚Äôs package (it happens more than I care to admit). It always made me feel so uncomfortable. Like I‚Äôve been lieing about being a lesbian, or who I am or something. I have since realised that I‚Äôm actually just jealous!! Since coming out recently (at 31) as nonbinary, and exploring things like wearing packers, it‚Äôs made me feel so much more comfortable in myself. I have slept with cis men recently and didn‚Äôt feel so ashamed as I did back then. Realising sexuality, gender, etc is so varied and elastic is amazing üôèüèª

Side note; not thinking of transitioning at this stage, but open to how I want to present myself in the future. Comfortable as enby atm! üòä"	hey! im really happy for you! dont let anyone gatekeep how you truely feel inside okay?? :>	dhnhei	NonBinary	8	0.91	2019-10-14 08:03:31
How do you get ladies' clothes to fit decently on an increasingly masculine body?	"I'm bi-gender, both binary female and binary male, with hard swings between the two genders. Androgyny is dysphoric for me.

When I am on a female swing, I'm all girl, love pretty stuff and wearing skirts, sparkly dangly earrings, etc. I love ""ladies cut"" shirts, girly colors and patterns, etc, and when I'm in full girl mode, even wearing ""unisex"" clothes is dysphoric. My girly side priority is my social presentation, being perceived as all girl. I really don't care what's under the clothes, as long as the outer presentation is all girl.

My guy side is still emerging as a social presentation (partly because a lack of budget keeps me from adding men's clothes to my wardrobe), but has a strong need to fully transition physically, and I've been on testosterone for nearly a year and loving the effects. While I adore the physical effects on my body, especially the muscle growth, and some of the changes are making it difficult to wear my feminine cut shirts. My arms and shoulders are bulking up very nicely and I love my new masc body, but if I go with a larger size ladies shirt to accommodate my musculature, it just hangs ugly on the rest of my body. I prefer closely fit (but not tight) clothing. As a large-breasted person (not for much longer!) I learned early that you buy a shirt to fit the largest size of your body, and alter the rest to fit, but I can't afford to get them all custom tailored, and I don't have the skills or equipment (sewing machine, etc) to do it myself.

I cannot afford to buy new clothes at this time. Not even Goodwill. 

*Note: by some miracle, my face hasn't been masculinized by testosterone, so I still look femme that way. 

So, what can I do to help me present fully femme as my body changes toward my desired masculine shape and form? How do I deal with ladies' cut clothes that don't fit?"	"There‚Äôs not much you can do if your shoulders are growing out of your shirts, I‚Äôm afraid (except buying new shirts‚Äî the alteration to broaden shoulders is kinda a big deal). If they fit around your shoulders and are overly baggy elsewhere, you can use belts/sashes, skirts, or high-waisted trousers to nip them in at the waist‚Äî vintage fashion from periods where broad shoulders were stylish might be a good source of inspiration. A fitted jacket, vest, or sweater over a loose shirt works too. 

And if you‚Äôre interested in learning to sew, taking in the side seams of a shirt is a good easy first project. ;) Perfectly doable with hand needle and thread. 
Speed maybe :-) 
I know how to sew. I'm just very bad at it, and my sewing machine died a couple of years ago, and I can't afford to replace it."	8lceu8	NonBinary	8	0.91	2018-05-22 18:38:47
I told my parents I'm transitioning	"I told my parents tonight that I called a doctor to talk about transitioning, and that I'm going to start the process of changing my name.

I understand this stuff is hard on parents. But they seem to not realize how hard it is on me.

My dad responded with, ""I'm sorry but I'm not really thrilled."" I told him I know but I felt like he should know. I mean I'm still on his insurance after all.

My mom responded with, ""I don't want to talk about this at dinner. You know it makes me sad.""

Dang is it too much to ask that my mom, the understanding one, the one who knows I need this, to at least try to be nice about it? Can she at least acknowledge that I'm taking care of myself?

It's like she doesn't realize that I need this more than she needs me to keep my old name. And she doesn't have an emotional connection to my breasts either.

She still doesn't really try to use my pronouns. She's starting to try to use my name.

Seriously I'm just gonna stop responding to my birth name unless it's a freaking doctor or someone random calling. Everyone else calls me by my name. What if we meet someone new? Are they gonna continue to call me a girl's name and use girl pronouns for me?

Just stop it already and don't make a fuss when I gently correct you about my pronouns or name. I don't need to hear every time about how it's hard and you've been using that name and those pronouns for me for 21 years. I just need you to say okay, correct yourself, and move on. You don't need to remind me how female you thought I was every time.

EDIT: I got my name change request submitted to my county court office on April 5, 2021. I expect it to be approved. I'll find out in the mail.

Dad refused to ""enable"" me by taking me to Walmart where I could get a money order, but my mom felt bad and she said she might help, if she had the ability (her car was in the shop and she can't drive my dad's truck because she's short), but she didn't want to make things worse by getting sad. Which I understand, and the way she explained it to me was kind.

My mom uses they/them pronouns regularly and my friends either use they/them or he/him (he/him is what I like the best). Doctors call me Will (that's the name I chose, thoughtfully of course), and use my pronouns too. My dad calls me by my new name, and so do my sisters, and most of the time they use my pronouns (my dad slips up sometimes, and my mom slips up every once in a while). It definitely feels better, and now hearing my dead name is just very weird (and stings a little, but not as bad as it used to).

Soon I will be changing my name with all my doctors and on my ID and with insurance and the bank, etc. I'm very excited for that :)

I got approved for a grant with a name change project in my area and they are paying for the entire cost of changing my name and renewing identification, and I even get up to 4 certified copies of my name change certificate.

It's still tough but at least they are using my name and pronouns, and that eases most everyday troubles."	"Yep. Same with my brother. He doesn‚Äôt want me to change my name, and when I talked about changing my middle name, he just straight up said ‚Äúno‚Äù. Just ‚Äúno‚Äù. *Sigh.* I think he‚Äôs been watching Ben Shapiro lately, so maybe that has something to do with it. Oh, well. I guess we‚Äôll just have to wait for them to come around, I guess?
I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm in a really similar position. I finally filed for name change and have my court date next month. And so I had to ask my mom for my birth certificate. And when I said that I needed to do this now and that I genuinely couldn‚Äôt wait much longer, she said ‚ÄúI know, it just sucks for me.‚Äù And before that in an earlier conversation, she asked if it was really necessary for me to do this, and isn‚Äôt it enough for people around me to use my new name?

I haven‚Äôt corrected her or my dad on my name. (My dad is actually better at it than she is, sometimes.) Mostly because I know that changing my name hurts her, so I grit my teeth and let her call me that. Even though it makes me really uncomfortable, they‚Äôre really the only people left who use my deadname (alone  with extended family because the thought of telling them terrifies me.) I know eventually she‚Äôll come around. She still loves and supports me and if she can get the day off, she‚Äôll be the one driving me to court. I‚Äôm doing my best to be patient and let her have her feelings, but damn does it suck being guilt tripped for this almost every time the conversation comes up.

I don‚Äôt have any advice, and I‚Äôm not saying any of how I‚Äôm approaching it is a good way/the right way. I have no idea what the right way is. It‚Äôs a difficult situation to deal with and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through it.

I hope things get easier and I wish you luck on your transition. - Hugs. -
Yea.

I'm changing my middle name as well, but my middle initial will stay the same. It's just the masculinization of my given one. I haven't liked my middle name since I was six. Sadly it's all over anything my grandmother sends me...

Shoot, when I change my name, I'm going to have to have her write my check to my new name instead. We were going to avoid telling her because my parents feel like she definitely wouldn't accept it, and I don't want to upset her.

Might have to talk to my grandfather about it too. I'm friends with him on Facebook so he's seen my name change, but he hasn't confronted anyone about it.

My other grandfather is dead and my mom's mom and sister are both supportive of me tho. They live in the same city so I get to see them pretty often.

Maybe if I write my grandmother a letter about it to explain it to her and let her know I'm okay and she doesn't need to worry about me, that would be better? And I can write an email/Facebook message for my grandfather too.

I just mainly don't want to upset them. But... I can't keep letting them write me checks I can't cash either. It's not fair to mess with their finances. So I might as well tell them.

Hopefully I'll still have some time to let it sink in with my grandmother when I have my name changed and tell her what it is before she decides to send me a birthday check. My next birthday is next month and there is no way I'd get it done by then, so I don't have to worry about it this year.

Maybe by then I'll have gained more wisdom and sensitivity so I can explain it better and offer more reassurance?
*hugs* thank you

It makes me feel a little better knowing someone gets it.

I hope it all works out well for you too."	iqljfc	NonBinary	10	1.0	2020-09-11 06:49:33
Help with non-binary partner	"I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub so if a mod wants this removed/change please tell me but here goes. 

I‚Äôve been dating my partner (18NB) for over a year now and recently I really messed up, I need help fixing this please and I don‚Äôt know who to ask or where to go. 

They‚Äôve been struggling w their gender for awhile (like  a month or so of serious questioning) wondering if they might be fully Trans Male, wondering if they want to present more masc. etc. they‚Äôve identified as non-binary since before I even met them them though- almost 3 years. 

Recently though, with them thinking they might be a trans guy, they started to like vent to me about this and just started talking about their gender kind of negatively (there were a couple like panic breakdowns they had where they were talking about their gender and not wanting to get dressed) I gave them the advice of ‚Äújust figure out who you want to be and how much you actually care about labels‚Äù and they said that actually helped.

But while this was happening, I was also kind of freaking out. If they transition, how will I support them? What if my attraction to their current body means that I can‚Äôt find those same things attractive without causing them dysphoria post-transition? What if I find it harder to be attracted to men? I‚Äôm bisexual but I‚Äôve never actually dated a man and that really scares me that I won‚Äôt know what to do. 

So while I‚Äôm freaking out about this, since I have nobody to ask- I ask them. And I basically asked this at the worst time. I freaked out about all this in a bunch of long texts after they made it clear they were having a gender moment (they were wearing a mascara mustache, I actually thought it looked really cool, I didn‚Äôt really consider that they could‚Äôve also been freaking out ) 

In response to this, they basically told me what is obvious to me now- definitely not the right time to ask that, should‚Äôve phrased it better, and I should be attracted to them no matter what and it‚Äôs not my decision. 

I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôll lose them, and I don‚Äôt care what label they have. But I‚Äôm also worried that I won‚Äôt know how to support them during/after a hypothetical transition, that I won‚Äôt know how to interact in a healthy way if they start identifying as male, etc. 

Since then we‚Äôve talked about this but their attitude towards me hasn‚Äôt really changed. They don‚Äôt seem to want to talk to me, and I‚Äôm really starting to think they‚Äôre about to break up with me. 



Tl;dr: Reacted badly to my partner introducing me to the idea that they might eventually transition to being male, is there any way for me to fix my mistake?"	"apologize. reaffirm that you love them and will do your best to support them no matter what they decide and that you value their happiness over any attraction/lack thereof you may end up having in the long run, and that you'll give it the old college try regardless of what they decide
So from the perspective of an outside observer, this already seems unhealthy. Number one, your partner's label or identity should matter. They may do a more typical 'trans man' transition without changing labels at all or they might only do some aspects not others. They might not medically transition in the 'typical fashion' but still ID as a trans man. These are things you should reflect on and consider if you can navigate those scenarios. I would be honest with yourself. Are you comfortable with your partner expressing their gender and understanding their gender as anything but their natal sex-lite? Your sexuality is your sexuality and you might not be able to expand it to include someone who is male or is far enough from female that you won't find them attractive. You shouldn't guilt yourself or let anyone manipulate you into thinking that way. It is good if that flexibility comes naturally but you can't force it. That will put a pressure on your partner's transition process and on you to be both attracted to them and supportive. Simply put, you may not be able to do both and you shouldn't force yourself to try. Being with someone out of obligation or to be correct in  a social justice sense just isn't going to work. You do deserve a relationship where you feel secure and happy with someone they can see yourself with and are fully attracted to. They deserve to be able to have a partner who sees them as their gender fully,to be able to express authentically, and be with someone who loves them for who they are not despite it. Be honest with yourself and reflect on that reaction because there is a truth to it. Be honest about how you see your partner and recognize if that is incongruent with their own self-perception or disempowering to it. Ultimately, do you see them as they are or as you want them to be? That is okay but you should be honest and forthright about your own needs.

Best of Luck"	ke1ip0	NonBinary	9	0.92	2020-12-16 03:39:48
Top surgery consultation recap (just need to get this off my chest....lolz)	"****Possible trigger warning for anyone struggling with experiences of vulnerability and being exposed.****

(Note: this is a personal experience I'm trying to wrestle with, so please don't feel obligated to read and please, please don't be discouraged either...I'm just in a weird situation lol this is not the norm for these things)

I had my consultation with the plastic surgeon yesterday and it was a mix of feeling really prepared and really unprepared.

I was prepared to give myself over an hour to find the office which was 25 minutes away, but was not prepared to actually need that whole hour due to getting lost...showing up 3 minutes before my appointment was stressful as I've never been late to a medical appointment in my life and started panicking that I would miss this one as God's punishment or something lol... (sigh)

But I made it, and was brought to a room where I was told to take off my top and bra (didn't bother with a binder since it takes me thirty years to remove it), which I had been preparing myself for all week. It's top surgery...someone had to look at my chest at some point.

I was not, however, prepared to be informed that there was a resident shadowing my surgeon, so that would be two men looking at my chest and touching me, but I kept reminding myself that viewing my body from a clinical perspective was waaay different than from a sexual one.

I was prepared to discuss my history and why I wanted top surgery...I was not prepared to be told that as soon as we were done chatting, they'd run the insurance request and schedule a second appointment for right before the surgery. I was referred here by my primary care, but I guess....I don't know, I thought I'd have to fight for it or something, but the general vibe I got was, ""This is happening."".

I was not prepared to be measured. 

I was NOT prepared to be measured.

I kind of just turned my head to the wall and tuned everything out, waiting for it to be over. ((Both men were extremely professional and polite---the surgeon would not even move the folds of my gown away but waited for me to do it ----but regardless....I was not prepared to be measured)

They took pictures  (sans face), but only after asking if it was okay....I had signed the consent form to take photos and agreed again when they verbally asked but.....I don't know. Our generation has spent way too much time hearing about tech breaches, and having very specific tattoos didn't help me feel confident about my ongoing anonymity.......although, I don't think I could ever be prepared to have pictures taken of my body like that, even though obviously nothing bad had happened.

I cannot emphasize enough how incredibly wonderful my surgeon was....he was so polite, professional, friendly and easy to talk to, appropriate, everything you could ask for in a stranger that got to walk in and see what nobody except your spouse would ever see.

But then we started talking about the procedure  (the nurse assured me he would go over all the details and answer every single question I had), and I off-handedly laughed when he asked if keeping sensation was important to me, to which I replyed that I'd be fine if he left me with nothing but two scars on my chest. 

He laughed with me and dismissed it at first, but caught something in my response. He gently explained to me that a 100% flat chest is a mastectomy but a male chest is different  (something about the remaining tissue curving a bit to give the definition of muscles or something like that).....and he started asking me quietly (and very gently still), ""Do you want a flat chest or a male chest?""

And he repeated it in the silence as I mentally fought with myself, terrified that if I answered honestly I'd be denied and have my 38D monstrosity forever, and I couldn't risk messing this up when I was so close...

But I stubbornly repeated that I wanted a flat chest because it was the truth and realizing I didn't even want a male chest left me reeling and confused, which I think he picked up on but didn't say anything disparaging.....and he said I was more than welcome to try and push through for the insurance, but I might have a better case if I had gone through a breast surgeon and requested a cautionary mastectomy due to my medical chart being flagged at a high risk for cancer...

He assured me that if I did end up going through his office (with or without insurance), he'd be happy to give me the flat chest I wanted, but warned me it was unlikely insurance would cover since I hadn't socially transitioned yet.......but I explained to him that I can't ever fully socially transition without losing far too much, that hormone treatment was highly unlikely, if ever.....and he concluded that perhaps special circumstances could apply, but that it was up in the air.

I left and was prepared to get lost on the drive home (which I did), but wasn't prepared for the jumble of echoing emotions that were ghosting around me. I was stressed but not overtly so, angry but not feeling vindictive, exposed but not taken advantage of, and just a general sense of being overwhelmed even though I wasn't completely sure why. I felt fine and terrible simultaneously.

All in all, from getting in the car that morning to getting home took a total of four hours, and I more or less haven't stopped shoveling junk food into my mouth since, restlessly moving from one purchase to the next and hoping I can stay distracted. 


I know I need to sit down and talk this through with myself, figure out what's up.....not being able to freely discuss it with anyone around me has left me frustrated as well.......but my spouse does not support me at all and overtly mocks the whole demographic, so I've just been inwardly feing very overwhelmed and confused, wondering if I've been mistaken about things, or if there's any other factor(s) of which I'm not yet aware......but I guess that's a post for another time. 



TL;DR: Do I even want to be a guy? Is my dysphoria linked to gender issues or something else? Stay tuned and maybe we'll both get to find out lol


‚ô°"	"That sounds like it was really tough for you and I wish you could have had someone supportive IRL to help you through that. Also your spouse being unsupportive is really horrible and can't be helping you to sort out your feelings on this. Don't judge yourself though (and if you do accidentally, don't judge the judging, you're human) because seriously this shit is hard.

I'm also dealing with a lot of chest-related questions after my breast reduction that I now realize should have at least gone a lot farther if not actually to a masc chest (mostly due to me suppressing my enby feels for two years). I'm still not sure what to do about that.

But yeah, don't try to force yourself into the binary if it feels wrong, even if it just feels wrong for now and you change your mind later. Labels can wait till you want them, so just do what you need to do to feel like you own your body, not like it owns you (no matter how that changes/doesn't change your chest). I wish you the best <3
I can relate to some parts of your experience. I‚Äôm AFAB non-binary and don‚Äôt want hormones or social transition (not really). A few months ago, I had a consult with a top surgeon, and I had no idea what to expect. 

At mine, I was not measured, merely asked what cup size I wore (easy question). Then the whole appointment was pretty much looking at photos on an iPad. The surgeon wanted me to see photos of common mistakes that surgeons made when converting a feminine chest to a masculine one, as well as photos of his results‚Äîwhich were more precise and consistent. The gist of what he told me was that they would make the cuts under the curve of the pectoral muscles, which would give the appearance of a male torso. The thing was, looking at all those pictures, I kind of realized that I DON‚ÄôT want a manly chest.  I tried to ask, in a roundabout way, if I could get ALL the breast tissue removed, and he said he didn‚Äôt recommend doing that, because taking everything off results in a ‚Äúconcave‚Äù effect. He did say, though, that if I wanted a ‚Äúgender neutral‚Äù chest, he could work with me to get what I wanted. So yay there.   

As a side note, I DID once have a ‚Äúholy crap they‚Äôre putting a measuring tape around my body?!‚Äù moment when doing a personal training consult. I didn‚Äôt know that they would put measuring tapes around your waist, arm muscles, etc, and I was NOT prepared for that because I hate being touched. XP
Thank you so much for posting this. I've had a lot of experience with surgeries for other things, but never like this, and it'd been worrying me. Surgery is just one of those scary anticipation games that are never fun, especially when making a decision like this. I never considered the actual question of ""what do you actually want,"" re: the shapes and I really truly appreciate you giving the breakdown of the starting process as well. I hope you do find someone supportive irl, you definitely don't deserve to have a spouse that mocks your identity! Best of luck !!!
I wish I had something to say that would feel appropriate, just went you to know that I appreciate that you were brave enough to share this. It couldn't have been easy to experience this moment, much less rehash, record, and share it.
I'm sorry it was tough for you. I think things like this can be hard because it's common to spend a lot of time thinking about it on your own or talking about it with friends, so you feel like you've processed it, but actually talking to a surgeon can bring up new things to consider. Not to mention it can be intimidating. But I think it's ultimately good to consider things like how flat you want your chest to be and what your surgeon can accomplish for you, even if it's a pain. For what it's worth, none of this invalidates your desire for surgery IMO. It's okay if you don't want a ""male"" chest.

I'm sorry your spouse is unsupportive. You deserve better than that.

My brother showed us what a lucky deal we got with our dad, but...	"My little brother and I are both transmasc.

Since my brother was in middle school, my dad wanted some time to make sure this was what he said it was, but my dad was ready to bring my brother to therapy and find a doctor for HRT after the right amount of time. He‚Äôs watching his own language and everybody else‚Äôs to make sure nobody‚Äôs hurting my brother or attacking his gender.    
    
We‚Äôre both transmasc. But he‚Äôs a trans man; I‚Äôm not. I like he/him pronouns, but I prefer them with they/them pronouns. I don‚Äôt think my dad will get that as easily. He supports all GSRMs,* but there are some he doesn‚Äôt understand, and it frustrates him. The most questionable conversations he‚Äôs ever had about this are about how ‚Äúgender doesn‚Äôt exist anymore,‚Äù or just today, ‚Äúgender‚Äôs being taken from people who care about it,‚Äù etc. He doesn‚Äôt understand all the changes in languages, he feels lost about what is and isn‚Äôt offensive now, and he doesn‚Äôt think he understands how we‚Äôre supposed to see gender anymore. We were just talking about it today, and he says he doesn‚Äôt blame trans or nonbinary people for it. Still, he always gets a little riled up when this comes up. It‚Äôs just enough that it worries me.    
    
I‚Äôm not out. I don‚Äôt know how to come out. I don‚Äôt want my identity to be a hot-topic debate or some confusing mess. I just wish it was as easy for me to come out as it was for my brother. I‚Äôm not saying that to be like ‚ÄúbInArY tRaNs PeOpLe HaVe PrIvIlEgE oVeR uS‚Äù because they don‚Äôt‚Äîbut in this one household, I‚Äôm still really jealous that when my brother says what he is, our dad always understands. I want to be called my name and both of my pronouns; I want to see a therapist and start my own transition; I want to be able to joke with my dad about all the stupid stuff that I‚Äôve noticed or that‚Äôs started happening since I began transitioning online, like how kids at my school got more excited to talk to me when I became the only trans/NB person in the room, or the memes and the little social circles I‚Äôve found for people like me, or hell‚ÄîI want to talk about how confusing this is with him as an NB. To be honest, I completely get his confusion. Before I started exploring my gender, I couldn‚Äôt wrap my head around what being nonbinary meant at all. I feel like it makes a little more sense from a first-person POV, but there‚Äôs still a lot I want to work through. I just don‚Äôt know if any of those conversations would go like I‚Äôd want them to.    
    
I know it‚Äôs a really common experience, our parents not understanding us. A lot of us have it worse, and get straight-up rejected by our parents. I‚Äôm so grateful I have a dad who is accepting, and is trying to understand everything, even if he doesn‚Äôt yet. Part of me just really hurts when I get to watch my younger brother go through his transition journey without any problems at home, but if I said anything about myself, my dad would just be completely lost."	Can you find any sort of articles or things like that to show your dad?/give to him to help him learn more? I think it might be a good idea to come out to him and try to help him understand (but obviously only do it if you‚Äôre comfortable). From what you‚Äôve said it sounds like he probably would want to learn and try to understand you. He might just have trouble understanding how to learn. And not understanding stuff can be frustrating, so I think that maybe if you had some resources to help him learn, stuff might work out (which I‚Äôm sure you know cause not understanding your own gender when you‚Äôre questioning stuff is way more confusing and frustrating than just not understanding someone else). This is just an idea and I obviously don‚Äôt know the whole picture, so do whatever makes you comfortable.üíö	m34l5m	NonBinary	8	1.0	2021-03-12 00:08:42
Finally made a step in the direction i want to go in	"Hi, long time lerker. On mobile. TL;DR at the bottom.
I wanted to share my little victory today because i can really use some nb support right now.

I've identified as nonbinary for a year now, and recently my dysphoria has been off-the-charts bad. Like, to a point where even leaving my room is difficult (bc strangers and even my own parents dont see or accept me as nb). I dont have any nb people around me, so I've been trying to handle the dysphoria on my own, which has been a huge struggle (there's only so much self-care you can do, bc strangers will still misgender me anyways).

My dysphoria triggers anxiety/depression as well, which doesnt help.

But today, i finally got the courage to make phone calls to get help. I got my health care straigtened out so I'll still be with the same primary care doctor (Im over 26, so i had to find my own health care and my job doesnt provide me one bc thats the nature of the job), and they gave me a phone number i can call to get hooked up with a psychologist/therapist/etc.

(Since im a highly sensitive person and an introvert, this hour of calling several places is all i can muster up the energy to do today, but) i took the first step into getting help with my dysphoria/possible transition (HRT, etc).

I still don't know if/when i want to do HRT or surgery, but getting my foot in the door has relieved my stress a lot.

After saying that, though, I have some questions for nonbinarys who have started transitioning: what steps did you take to get on T and get breast removal surgery? I've been struggling to find info on how to get going with these, so if you could offer me insights, i would appreciate it! 

TL;DR my dysphoria has been super bad; i finally made some phone calls to get started on getting help with it. Questions: what did you have to do to get started on T and/or breast removal surgery? 


"	"see if there's a group of trans-friendly doctors in your area or a city near you? or maybe an lgbt advocacy group that could point you in the right direction. that's how i've found my doctors. really happy for you that you're taking care of yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è
I have my first appointment with an endocrinologist for HRT next month. My process was...

Found a gender therapist. Referred by my local LGBTQ+ center, but also looked up on the PsychologyToday website, filtered by ""transgender"".

Called all prospective therapist's offices, asked if they had experience with transgender/nonbinary patients, wrote referral letters for medical transition and followed WPATH standards of care.

Got diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Worked on figuring out what I wanted transition wise and how to deal with family members and my spouse through the process. Eventually got my letter.

Researched providers for HRT within driving distance of me. Found reviews where possible and referrals from regional trans advocacy sites. Double checked which were in network for my insurance. Made a short list.

Called each provider, confirmed they provided HRT to transgender patients, that they were accepting new patients and took my insurance.

Contacted my insurance company and got in writing that all the providers on my short list were in network and that I could make an appointment for transgender HRT without a pre-authorization and it would be covered.

Picked one, called them again to confirm their referral procedure. Got all the info I needed and gave it to my therapist's office to send in my letter and other info.

Called the doctor's office the following week to confirm they got my referral, confirmed my info and made an appointment date and time.
Thanks for the advice. Im glad you found your doctor! Thanks; im doing one thing at a time üòä
Thanks for the detailed steps! Its really helpful.
Sure, good luck!"	a9up8v	NonBinary	8	1.0	2018-12-27 01:50:08
May some fellow enbie lend a hand ?	"Hello everyone !  
So, i don't know where to start, it's probably the first time i talk about being non-binary on the net and in english !

&#x200B;

I knew that something was wrong when i was a teenager, and for a long time i thought i was trans despite feeling something was not right. Some years ago, still very in the closet, i heard about the possibility of being non-binary and it changed my outlook on this matter. Since then i tried to strip myself from a part of the masculinity i wore (i'm assigned male at birth... AMAB.. ? Is that how we say it..?), i, for one, stopped to wear only black clothes, died and colored some of my hair, adapted a bit of my language and, the most subtle but the most important, i adapted my behavior and what sweat from me, my aura if you prefer.

&#x200B;

I'm still very much inside the closet as i live in a country and in an environment where not gloryfying male identity when you are one is really badly seen (words like ¬´ they ¬ª also didn't exist in my language). I talked very carefully with some people at prides and in some private circles, but non-binary peoples are more scarce than trans, for example.

&#x200B;

I have tons of questions all the times... Like, i do feel that i want to transitionate in some form, but i don't know how. Did you do some sort of transition, even without hormone.. And how do you did it ?  
Over the course of years i projected a lot in my partner (they were all females), is it bad ? I feel like if i talk about that it may seem like i have some sort of fetish for tomboyish girl or androgynous people (and they do have some appeal to me) but deep down i clearly feel it's more than that and more than just wanting to be the other gender (as i'm also aware that the grass seem more green on the other side but it's far more complicated and i should not think so simply).  
I have quite a lot of facial hair and i think they suit me, but then again, i'm confused about this part of my look and how i feel. What do you think about it.. ?   
Also, as there is no neutral pronouns in my mother tongue, non-binary people made one, i doesn't feel that much invalidated when called by the pronouns corresponding to my gender assignated at birth. It may keep me in the closet and forbid me to stand my ground when needed, tho....

&#x200B;

I'm a bit lost and i feel exposed just with talking about all of that but i'm searching for answers and with the proportion of the subject i have difficulties to think straight, so i'm counting on y'all with sharing some of your experiences.

Sorry for the weird english and the faults, thanks in advance for your understanding !"	"Hi there! No need to apologize for your English, it‚Äôs perfectly understandable.

I‚Äôm also not sure what to do with my body. I don‚Äôt want people to see me as a man or a woman, and I can mostly get by with my body as-is. Mostly. That makes me afraid to take hormones because there are some effects I know I don‚Äôt want, and they are some of the first things to happen. I am also scared of being unable to continue in my career if I do not fit in. 

I think these are all really common fears, whether society is a bit more open or close minded. Just because I know a non-binary person who is out and safe doesn‚Äôt mean I have the courage and strength to constantly correct people and have to push others to acknowledge me properly. It is hard, and unless I changed jobs to something in social work (like a trans clinic) I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll find coworkers who take my non-binary identity seriously (I am in engineering & manufacturing). 

Even with pronouns, I want to be referred to correctly as ‚Äòthey‚Äô but as long as I stay in my career, I will be called my agab (assigned gender at birth) pronouns. I guess I value stability and safety more than fighting for myself. This is only one aspect of who I am, and if I have to let go of all these other things I want, I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll be left feeling just as bad but for other reasons.

Not everything is sad or terrible! I just wanted to share so you know you aren‚Äôt alone, and people feel like this all over, whatever country and culture they are in. Much love to you figuring out what you need and what‚Äôs achievable with your other goals. üíúüíúüíú
I'm really late in answering this ! (had some health problem) But thanks you for your words, even if it doesn't answer much, it does help even a tiny bit :)  
I am much like you in these areas you are defining there, so i won't have to add much (especially one week after it... x)), but if you ever find this answer i wish you the best and be sure that i will do what i can for a more acceptant world :p"	asjner	NonBinary	8	1.0	2019-02-20 04:00:45
Transitioning, presentation changes and getting over the fear of being a labelled a trender	"Hey r/Nonbinary!
I‚Äôm struggling a little bit with something and I‚Äôm hoping to see if anyone has any advice.

I started T back in May and had top surgery back in September. My body is finally starting to look right and my voice finally seems to be dropping. 

Something I‚Äôve noticed though is that now that all this is happening, my taste in clothing is becoming more experimental and even fem leaning androgynous. 

I think most of my dysphoria is centered on things about my body. The shape of it, my voice, bottom dysphoria, etc. They‚Äôre all overwhelmingly awful at times. My social dysphoria is pretty bad too, being seen as a girl is crushing. But it feels like I‚Äôm ready to experiment a little more. I‚Äôve been trying out wearing skirts in a kind of androgynous, goth-y high fashion sort of way. Capes. Open shirts and shirts with lots of ruffles. Those sorts of things. Haven‚Äôt worn them out of the house yet though. 

It‚Äôs only just the sort of clothing that feels best to me a lot of the time now though, and I‚Äôm worried what people will think. I‚Äôm scared of people thinking I‚Äôm a ‚Äútrender‚Äù or that dressing like this could mean I‚Äôll be perceived as a girl forever, even while medically transitioning. I‚Äôm worried that friends and family will think I changed my mind, but it feels more like what‚Äôs happening was that before I had to play up masculinity so much aesthetically to look androgynous but now it feels like I want to have fun with my aesthetic and can aim to pass (or confuse people! That‚Äôs always fun) due to my body, voice eventually hopefully, mannerisms, etc. Wearing skirts and such feels like crossdressing to me, but other people probably wouldn‚Äôt think that just yet. 

I also feel a lot more confident calling agender now. t feels best when strangers perceive me as a man and use he pronouns, but ultimately beyond being transmasc and needing people to see me as male, I don‚Äôt really feel any sense of gender at all. Basically, genderless void person lmao. 

So I guess this is a case of fear and even dysphoria dysphoria? Fear of people discounting how bad my dysphoria is because it hurts to have something that‚Äôs so often debilitating treated as a nonissue. I don‚Äôt know. Anyone have any advice with trying to just stop caring so much?"	"For your friends and family thinking you may have changed your mind, you could try to talk to them about how gender expression doesn't equal gender identity. Not all enby people have to present androgynous or opposite to their AGAB to be enby. Maybe try to educate them on gender expression and such a bit more to explain that you haven't changed your mind, you're just trying out new clothes to see what feels good for you
I hear you, and I've had similar worries. This kind of nonbinary phobia gets stuck with us sometimes, and there can be a lot of expectations on how we should present ourselves. But we can't change other people, so we do need to ultimately work on putting ourselves first and not caring what others think; the ""those who matter dont mind and whose who mind dont matter"" philosophy.

But I am right there with you. Had top surgery and am on hormones, not really attached to the gender binary but would rather be seen as a man than a woman, and I love my more androgynous, alternative, even feminine style I wear these days. Mesh shirts, skirts, rompers, short shorts, open shirts, these things feel way more comfy to wear now that my body matches what I think I should. I can wear these more feminine clothes in a masculine way and that's what I wanted. 

We can all agree that clothing has no gender, that folks can wear whatever they want, and this goes for nonbinary and transgender folks too, even if that style is associated with their birth gender. 

All this to say, you're not alone. And the more comfortable you get with your identity and expression, the easier it will be to accept this and be happy with your expression.
Hey, this helps a lot honestly and even though I know logically that I‚Äôm not by myself in this sort of thing, it absolutely helps to hear other people‚Äôs experiences. It‚Äôs reassuring honestly.

Same boat too, it does feel a lot like what you said- wearing feminine clothes in a masculine way. I hope I‚Äôll be able to settle into feeling more comfortable in my identity over time, I know I should be happy about being able to experiment more now that my body isn‚Äôt beating my ass 24/7 (more like. 23/6 now haha) but there‚Äôs so much nervousness around it! It‚Äôs exciting to have that feeling of finally coming into my own though. It feels at home."	kffs94	NonBinary	9	0.91	2020-12-18 06:23:56
I‚Äôm wondering if any nonbinary people here identify with my experiences cause I‚Äôm doubting my identity	"They/them pronouns. I am unsure if I am trans or not. It is this weird phenomenon that is happening where I'm like I am pretty sure I am trans but then I'm like are you sure because of anti-trans rhetoric and stuff. My gender as far as I know has been fluctuating ever since middle school. I tried to socially transition in high school once I learned about being non-binary. I told my parents about it and they tried but barely. Even for a bit my SO did not respect my pronouns. I did not have decent experiences. So then, I stopped caring. I didn't mind being called she/her. I didn't actively look for the gender neutral bathrooms. I didn't even mind being called girlfriend. But now, I feel cringe and anxiety being called she/her. I look for the gender neutral bathrooms if there is a map. I mind being called wife (now married to SO). I even wear they/them pronoun pins on my bag. So, the main reason I'm wondering if I am trans is because I stopped caring in 2019/2020 when I was 19/20 but now all of a sudden I started caring in Spring 2022 when I was 22. My SO has been telling me ""I want the old days when things were simple"" and ""You didn't use to care what I called you or referred to you as"". My memory is also bad so I don't know if I should trust my old reddit post or what my SO has told me recently. 

Reddit post here for reference: (https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/ckj7ti/should_i_ever_reveal_that_i_dont_identify_as/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

The other reason I am questioning if I am trans is because I have seen the hate spewed toward trans people online and it is abhorrent. I mean everytime I see some demeaning comment about trans people I get sad and to be honest, when I see comments specifically saying things like ""Nonbinary people don't exist"" or ""They are just attention seekers"" or ""It's a trend"" make me physically sick that it also impacts my mental health. Like I don't wanna deal with possible future hate. Though there was one situation in which I may have possibly been discriminated against for having my pin (not sure). At the same time I don't wanna be in the closet. 

Also, don't worry I am trying to find a gender identity therapist. It's just luck hasn't been so good. Does anyone have any advice or any input on how I can navigate whether I am trans or not? Or what is your opinion of whether I am trans or not.

P.S. I am aware that nonbinary is under the trans umbrella.

Also willing to DM more of my experiences growing up to see if we can relate."	"I was like that in high school, for me it comes in cycles ‚Äúboy mode‚Äù ‚Äúgirl mode‚Äù ‚Äúother mode‚Äù ‚ÄúwtfamIevendoingI‚Äômjustaspeckofspacedust mode‚Äù it comes and goes to varying degrees and sticks around for unknown lengths of time with little rhyme or reason. I also go by They/them pronouns because it‚Äôs the most middle of the ground language I can stick with. I‚Äôm non-binary and gender-fluid, I am trans.
Hi there! I personally am afab & genderfluid. I go by they/he/she (in that order) If you aren't respected as a trans/nonbinary person it's super difficult to find your identity. I had a lot of people I dated in the past completely neglect who I was and try to even put labels on me when I confided in them about my identity. A huge part of feeling like yourself is to feel safe being yourself. I'm very glad you found a therapist, they should be able to help you sort out your identity and what helps you feel like you. Like- pronouns or words like partner instead of wife/husband. See what feels like you!!
I have found the simple heuristic ‚Äòno cis person questions their gender this much‚Äô to be very reassuring when I ask myself this question. In reading what you‚Äôve said, it sounds like being nonbinary and using gender neutral terms has been very important to you to for a long time, even if the amount of that importance has fluctuated over the years. I think that makes you trans! It‚Äôs ok to not be comfortable being fully open about it or feel that ‚Äògoing with the flow‚Äô re: how people perceive you is the better/safer option. Still can be trans.
It sounds like you were less ‚Äúserious‚Äù about your pronouns being respected because it felt safer. It‚Äôs ok to fluctuate. You are totally trans if that feels right, and I absolutely feel the fear in response to the extreme anti-trans rhetoric.

My heart goes out to you. The fact that your partner is so dismissive and unwilling to try deeply saddens me. I would feel so alone and unseen. I hope you can work something out, and that your SO will put in the MINIMAL effort it takes to use your pronouns and understand what that means to you. Honestly if your SO doesn‚Äôt, it may be worth considering leaving this person. Because this person clearly only wants to be with a cis woman and doesn‚Äôt see your valid true self. 

Best of luck on your journey, I wish you all the best and I hope love, validation, and respect come your way
Im transmasc and i do feel something similar, ive just pretended to be a binary trans man bc i too couldnt cope with what people said. For me, having a good support system helped so much bc talking to and making more trans/nb friends made it so much easier to understand who i was and not feel shame - if i get any self hating thoughts i remember that i would never treat any other nb person that way so i wont treat myself that way too.
Hope this helps, and i hope you find the support you deserve to be yourself as freely as you want!
(Plus Dr Z phd on youtube was SO reassuring for any gender related and questioning info)
It sounds to me like you are non binary (and possibly trans) but trying to protect yourself in order to survive in a very toxic environment. My thoughts, based on my experience, you will need a change a lot about your environment before you are truly happy. I knew I wasn't a girl for 15+ years but I didnt understand how to be accepted as anything other than a woman. 

Somethings to consider...
Trying finding an affirming partner in queer spaces
Try living in a more trans friendly area
Apply for jobs that care about diversity 

These are all major changes but I can tell you I did all of these things (divorce, new partner, new job, new city) in about 9 months and I cannot believe how amazing my life is now. Trans joy is real and worth the blood, sweat, and tears it takes to achieve. 

Maybe that's not the path for you, but I want you to at least know it's possible.
I'm doubting myself right now. So I was aware of ""another person"" for over 10 years but I often separated them because I was like,I can't be a boy,so I'm not and went on a carried on as a woman,even though I knew of this presence. Anyway I initially didn't think I was nonbinary because I didn't exactly know what that was and it was only when I bought an lgbt keychain last year when when I actually started questioning. So after I realized that I am nonbinary,I went on a journey,told my partner that I was ok with she/they which is actually they/them/she but I'm still mostly called by female pronouns and I'm afraid or it's too much work to bother to correct people. So I'm doubting my identity even though I'm comfortable being nonbinary and I feel like it was the way I was all along. I am having imposter syndrome and I feel like i should just live my life as a cis woman because it's easier. It sucks right now
I agree with you that when you‚Äôre not respected as a trans/nonbinary person it‚Äôs harder to navigate your identity. I did find a therapist but unfortunately I‚Äôm on her waitlist because I‚Äôm starting to think it could have to do with autism too and there are not many therapists in my state that cater to autism and gender identity.
For me being less ‚Äúserious‚Äù in the past it may have been because I didn‚Äôt want to deal with correcting everybody. I got tired of correcting people because it was too much effort. Now, I just let people call me she/her because I am afraid of how people may react and it could hold up a line. 

Also, my bad, I don‚Äôt think I was clear in my post. My SO uses my pronouns now. In my reddit post I said he didn‚Äôt use them but that was in the past."	11u7xpq	NonBinary	7	0.89	2023-03-17 23:38:38
Rewarded activities for a research project on public spaces in London (UK)	"Hi there!

My name is Milan and I‚Äôm a French geography student. My PhD research focuses on transgender people and their access to public spaces in the UK and France. More specifically, I compare the effects of political frameworks and activism history on effective access to public spaces, including streets, green spaces, shops, pubs, administrations, services, sports facilities‚Ä¶ in short: any place that is open to the public.

I am trans myself (FTM) and I‚Äôve been building my research methods in collaboration with trans rights organizations in Paris.

**I‚Äôm looking for trans people living, studying or working in the London region** for some activities which will be divided into three steps. To thank you for your time and contribution, **you will be rewarded ¬£50**, thanks to my university.

* We will first run an interview, to get to know each other better. If you‚Äôre okay with it, the interview will be recorded (I am not a native speaker and taking notes and focusing on the conversation at the same time is really hard for me!). This is going to take approximately an hour. If you want to help but don‚Äôt have that much time and/or don‚Äôt   care about the money, we can stop after this first step.
* The second step consists of choosing three days in your week where you would hold a diary or everything you do in public spaces and how you feel about it. You can take notes on paper, on your phone, can pictures, draw or record voice notes if you‚Äôre more comfortable with it.
* Thirdly, we‚Äôll see each other again or call each other, in order to talk about how you felt about the activities and about what happened during these three days.

The activities are open to **anyone self-identifying as trans**, whatever age, gender (binary, non-binary‚Ä¶) social background and whatever transitioning realities their life embraces. Everything we do together will stay strictly anonymous.

If you‚Äôre interested in taking part into the study or to be kept updated of the main results, you can contact me on Whatsapp (+33684801770), Facebook (Milan Bont√©), Twitter ([@BonteMilan](https://twitter.com/BonteMilan)) or by email ([milan.bonte@parisgeo.cnrs.fr](mailto:milan.bonte@parisgeo.cnrs.fr)).

I would be extremely grateful to you if you helped me to **spread this message to your relatives and into your own networks**.

Thank you very much for your help. I hope to see you soon!

Typical coming out to parent woes	"I'm in the process of having coming out discussions with my parents. I'm 31. I've been out to them/publicly via social media for a year. A year ago I moved from 3000 miles from my hometown back to the same state, so coming out (again) and specifically to my family at this point was an important part of transitioning back to this environment. In my past living situation out of state, I was out to everyone I knew/cared about for years. A part of this whole journey included finding my own name for myself. I go by Kit ‚ù§Ô∏è. I‚Äôve been using Kit for a few years now, and just about the whole time I‚Äôve been back in state (it took practice sticking up for myself/reminding people here, and I wanted to be patient with others‚Äô journeys and growth). 

My parents are the only ones not on board. They insist that because they named me, they know me and I AM this past version of myself that they are more comfortable (less threatened) by. They won‚Äôt call me Kit. Sometimes they won‚Äôt even talk to or address me at all. 

Ugh. 

Its a big OUCH but I‚Äôm also not interested in taking it to heart. I know how to keep my distance and have an honest relationship with them from my end, and I know how to be patient with their journey. 

But also BOOOOOOOOOO!!! Boo. Ugh. The pits!

My mother is trying to find ammo and any excuse to invalidate what I‚Äôm trying to share with her. She‚Äôs pissed that I‚Äôm not/haven‚Äôt like waited for her approval to be who I am in life. She‚Äôs deeply embarrassed of this development for my life. She admits it‚Äôs selfish yet clings to that point of view and set of values anyway. She honestly believes/asserts I‚Äôm being controlling over HER by expecting her to use my name: Kit. 

Again I‚Äôm 31. I‚Äôm a ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù adult by many, many of her standards and expectations. (Idgaf about her expectations really but just for some of her perspective I guess). I‚Äôm a fantastic parent, partner, and person - again, things she tells me she believes. But ‚Äúnow‚Äù I‚Äôm ‚Äúgay‚Äù (she has only two buckets: ‚Äúgay‚Äù and ‚Äúnot gay‚Äù). So we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ fighting ü§∑üèªüôÑ

I‚Äôve tried to compassionately point out how ridiculous that is lol. I feel like I have to just wait, enjoying and appreciating and fully living my beautiful life and wait for her to‚Ä¶ what? Trust her eyeballs that I‚Äôm just a rad person and she can let her control go? Idk. 

Anyone have suggestions, ideas, words to help me understand or process this? Encouragement or refocusing? ‚ù§Ô∏è

Love y‚Äôall, my enby crew. Grateful for this space ‚ò∫Ô∏è"	I'm real interested to hear how this all shakes out, I'm kind of preparing myself to come out to mine too	q60njz	NonBinary	7	1.0	2021-10-11 17:13:20
Sort of a new coming out to myself:)	"Hey there lovely people,

I've been posting here every once in a while and yes I'm still non-binary, in fact more than I ever was.

So until now I identified as something inbetween male and non-binary, sort of demiguy/transmasc, or sometimes just a guy but with extra steps (impostor syndrome?!)

Got confronted with some truscum stuff lately, and started feeling invalid bc I was sad there was a ""right"" and ""wrong"" way to be trans that I didn't know of. And my transition plans fall all the way in the ""wrong"" part.

All that made me question my gender again. The way it went might suspect I identify as a binary trans guy now. BUT I DON'T, HA! I just realized how much I actually don't have a gender AT ALL.
I'M AGENDER WOOP WOOP

My transition plans stayed exactly the same (and kinda trans guy-like still, but bodies don't have gender duh), I just came to know that I'd just feel more at home in a more masculine body, but that doesn't make me a man. Idk what having a gender gender feels like tbh.

..and that the ""right"" or ""wrong"" thing is absolute bs and I'm determined to be more non-conforming than ever and I LOVE being trans/enby.  And that my goals don't have to fit in even if I *was* a man.

I still don't care which pronouns you use on me, um... could you please suggest me some super cool neopronouns? And maybe use them on me? I want to finally try them out!

Anyway watch me become an absolute queen of a genderless alien elf boy princess over the next few years:) I'll destroy gender:D

Hoping someone might be able to help me here [they/he]	"I've been using the word ""butch."" But seeing as ""butch"" has a very strong root in being a lesbian / relating to lesbianism, and I've recently I've realized I'm more on the ""bisexual"" or ""pansexual"" side of things, I feel a little awkward / intruding when calling myself ""butch,"" now. I just like to say I'm gay/queer, because it feels more accurate to me, but I don't really care what gender / biological sex my partner is, as long as I get along with them, you know?

I'm also planning on transitioning, or at least partially transitioning. I want top surgery and am debating about going on Testosterone \[low dose vs high dose\]. I don't think I'd ever be interested in bottom surgery, and I already have some sensitivity / sensory issues with the way pants fit-- but when I feel comfortable enough, I like to pack.

Basically, if I had to describe my gender, it's like-- ""I want straight people to look at me and assume I'm a man, but I want queer people and the people close to know I'm not really a 'man'.""

Does anybody know if there's some terms or a community like that ?"	"I mean, that sounds like butchness/queer masculinity to me. Historically, all sorts of queer people, not just lesbians, have called themselves ""butch"". As a lesbian I don't find gay men, nonbinary/genderqueer, or bi/pan folks calling themselves butch or femme harmful to lesbians or the queer community as a whole, it's just trying to restrict language within a community of people who are more the same than they are different. I say call yourself butch if you want to.
Well, the equivalent to butch outside of the lesbian community is stag (doe = femme, stag = butch) but there's not a big community for it.
I‚Äôm kinda in a similar situation (masc presenting afab who used to ID as a lesbian lol) and I like the term transmasculine. Demiboy may fit too? The masc flavors of non-binary so to speak lol
Personally I use butch or stud when speaking to older people as they know what those words mean and tend not to ask more questions than needed with that. There's nothing wrong with using those words to describe masculinity in an afab person. Yes it's used a lot in the lesbian community but so are a lot of other words that are used across many other communities. A lot of lesbians still refer to me as a stone butch even when I'm in relationships with men. So it really doesn't matter. If you don't like the connection to lesbians and that female identity side of things just use transmasc or masculine
Ah, that's cool. It kinda bites that not many people use it, though.

Just know the rural kid in me is screaming in joy, lol.
Yeah. I've just been calling myself nonbinary / transmasc

Also-- glad to see someone else who refers to it as ""flavors,"" I thought my friend and I were the only ones, lmao.
I know, I really wish it was more common, I can't find anyone else that uses it besides me lol. Hopefully it picks up traction though, I love the term!
Yeah figuring out what labels work and which ones don‚Äôt has been a ride ajsjs, sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm better off not labeling it lol

And that‚Äôs funny lmaooo
Honestly, same.

I just tell people I'm a queer person and leave it at that lmao
As long as I confuse the fuck outta cishets my goal is achieved lol

A Delayed Introduction (LONG post)	"Hi! I‚Äôm Dani? (Still trying out different names) I‚Äôm 26, AMAB, Genderfluid, and Pansexual. You may have seen my commenting a LOT recently. I‚Äôve actually been around for quite a while but I never post much of my own stuff. So, I‚Äôm finally gonna introduce myself here. *Fair warning: This may get long as I tend to ramble a bit.*

Also: I‚Äôm not good at judging these things but I can say for sure: **\[TW: Transphobia\]** (If anyone thinks I should add anything else please let me know)

*(Backstory and relevant info ahead)*

When I was young, I was always referred to as the ‚Äúboy who was very in touch with his feminine side‚Äù by most of my family. This never bothered me because I knew I was. In high school I tried the few labels I knew, and nothing really fit. I experimented with my sexuality too and eventually settled on pansexual. The thing that really held me back was my understanding of being transgender.

Given that my parents knew almost nothing about it and the school system fails in so many ways, my understanding was very basic: If you were a man who wanted to be a woman or vice versa, you could get surgery to change your parts and be more comfortable. That was all. That‚Äôs literally ALL I knew about.

I knew that I was at least OK with my body parts as they were. So, I couldn‚Äôt be trans. I had met lots of trans people especially in High School and they all fit this definition, so I had no reason to question it. Until one day I was reading a web comic where one of the characters through the help of magic can change their physical traits pretty much at will. Eventually he (as far as I know still prefers he/him) has a bit of a meltdown over complicated feelings about gender when his girlfriend tells him that these feelings sound like genderfluid.

As I read it, he and I have the same reaction. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a name for it?‚Äù ([Here](https://www.egscomics.com/comic/2014-07-01) is the page if you want to see yourself) Suddenly a whole world had opened up to me. I started doing research into non-binary gender which I had never even considered were a thing before. Everything just clicked!

I came out to my close friends not long after and they were all TOTALLY supportive. They were also all female and as such had SO many tips about being feminine, dressing, makeup, etc. and most importantly for me... most of them were close enough in size to give me some of their cloths to try on.

(One of these friends went on to become my girlfriend not long after and now she‚Äôs my fianc√©.)

On my 21st birthday I figured it was time to come out to my parents (who I still live with) about both gender and sexuality. I used some comic that I can no longer find that gave very basic examples of how each works. As expected, they were ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù as in... They don‚Äôt get it at all, but they want me to be happy. Dad looked like he couldn‚Äôt care less which is about as much as can be expected.

I also told them that at least for the time being I didn‚Äôt care what they wanted to call me. I was experimenting with pronouns and different terms to see what fit so I didn‚Äôt mind. As can be expected the kept with he/him/son/etc. It‚Äôs what they were used to. Aside from the occasional ‚Äúdad joke‚Äù my father would use; I didn‚Äôt get much support from him. Mom would at least try new things from time to time. She often just referred to me as her ‚Äúchild‚Äù to use neutral terms.

On the rare case that I would present feminine around the house, she would call me she/her/daughter and that made me immensely happy. Dad on the other hand, wouldn‚Äôt really say anything. He would avoid pretty much any conversation to or about me and he‚Äôs probably not aware, but I caught him giving me very concerned looks while he thought I wasn‚Äôt looking.

After a while I just stopped doing that any time he was around... or anyone was around for that matter... The only people I was actually comfortable around were my (at the time) best friend who I had known for longer than I can remember, and my girlfriend who had supported me in everything I didn‚Äôt since middle school. I was incredibly lucky to have them.

Laura, my best friend, was much thinner than me and as such had a very different style. But she still gave me all kinds of accessories and helped with my hair and makeup when she could. Once I wanted to show off and my mother simply responded with ‚ÄúWow, I have a daughter!‚Äù I was kind of hoping for a bit more, but it made me feel accepted for who I was.

Time goes on. I‚Äôm still living with my parents but under a very different arrangement. My girlfriend became my fianc√©, and we have a kid together. Laura... Seems to have moved on in her life without me. It seems that My fianc√© in the only one who still fully accepts me for who I am anymore. I never feel comfortable presenting any way that not masculine or androgynous around my family, EXPECIALLY with my racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic grandfather who lives RIGHT NEXT DOOR and often comes over without warning.

This year for me has come to be a year of discovery. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm waking up from a dream and JUST realizing so much about my life that was right in front of me and I somehow never noticed. Like how my father is borderline abusive to both me and more so to my mother.

But more than that I realized just how much I enjoy boing feminine. Being called ‚Äúshe‚Äù or ‚Äúher‚Äù or ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù or anything like that. Wearing things that I found comfortable like skirts, dresses, leggings, etc. Roleplaying (mostly in video games) as a woman. One day I looked in the mirror and saw a beautiful woman staring back at me, smiling. That‚Äôs when the big one hit me.

My inner image of myself IS a woman! **Mind BLOWN**

I took the next few weeks searching my feelings to figure out exactly what I wanted. Much to my surprise I came to the conclusion that I wanted to at least semi-transition. I‚Äôm still not sure exactly how far I want to take it, but I know for sure this is what I want. I still identify as genderfluid, but I realize now that I‚Äôve always leaned more towards the feminine side and now I want to present how I feel.

I started micro-dosing Estradiol a few months ago. I can already see (and more importantly FEEL) some changes. My skin is softer, my body hair is starting to become thinner, and most notably: I HAVE BOOBS! I mean‚Ä¶ I *kinda* had something before due to being overweight, but I‚Äôve gained 2 cup sizes in a fairly short amount of time. By far my favorite change in the past few months: My confidence has been boosted to a level I haven‚Äôt seen since high school. (I was a theater kid who loved the attention. What can I say?)

However, not all has been good since I started‚Ä¶ A few weeks ago, I got into an argument with the person I THOUGHT was my best friend. She and I had dated back in high school and last year got back in touch. We quickly reconnected and got very close. She has stood by me as I discovered all of these things and even offered to help where she could. I needed someone like that in my life.

She‚Äôs completely cut off all contact and quite frankly with what she did I want nothing to do with her either. (I‚Äôm not gonna go into what happened) But this leaves me with a distinct lack of close friends. Aside from my wife I have: Laura (who rarely talks to me anymore), Joe (who due to various reason I don‚Äôt feel comfortable talking about gender and sexuality with), and Tori (another old friend who I recently reconnected with, but I‚Äôm not close enough to comfortably talk about these things with).

I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been on here so much. Finding similar people who might just understand me. In any event, that‚Äôs pretty much my story. Sorry to anyone who actually just read all of that. I wasn‚Äôt planning on writing a whole essay here."	"Just leaving a message to let you know I read the whole thing. Sorry you've had a lack of support in your life, but I'm happy that you found someone you can share your life with! Thank you for sharing your story :)
I read and I feel you so much~ I'm AMAB too and only recently accepting my identifying more femme. I honestly think I was hiding partially in the label of non-binary (though I still think that's part of my story I just don't know where labels fit anymore). Likewise I'm almost certain my parents won't be supportive interested and many of my older friends seem to have this subconscious aversion to the ""old me"" which feels weird. I am finding that a few of my friends in particular are more supportive though~ 
I can't offer committed communication as I'm already at my capacity for socializing with all that's going on in my life but I want you to know that you sharing your experience was really helpful to me and that I'd be happy to chat anytime üòä I wish you the best in your journey!

Pregnant Egg seeks advice from other AFABs about chesticle hatred	"I am really struggling with how my body has been changing & becoming aggressively feminine since becoming pregnant & I thought Enbies would probably be the best people to talk to about this, for advice and/or commiseration because my husband is wonderful but just does not understand or know how to help, & hearing him say ‚Äúyou know you‚Äôre always beautiful to me‚Äù just isn‚Äôt enough right now unfortunately.

I‚Äôm still discerning whether I myself am Nonbinary or just a Cis Bi woman who is very gender non conformative, loves crossplay/drag, & wants to remove her boobs. (I don‚Äôt really care about pronouns so I just go by She/Her usually cause that‚Äôs low maintenance) but I strongly identify with most Nonbinary posts/content I see, so I thought this was worth a shot. 

I have always just not really enjoyed my boobs, & found them to be in the way & not worth the hassle except once in a while when they looked nice in a particular dress. I love the ‚Äòfemboy‚Äô aesthetic & have for years wished I could have that nice flat look under my shirts without having to wear a binder. But I have no problem with my feminine shoulders, hips or genitals (other than finding all genitals gross in general because I‚Äôm on the Ace spectrum lol)

So I tried to brush it off as ‚Äúoh all women have body image issues & hate their boobs. This is totally normal.‚Äù

Then it suddenly occurred to me about 6 months ago that top surgery WAS a thing, & there are enby folks out there who just get that, without hormones or other transitioning steps....& realizing that was a viable (if expensive & complicated) option immediately made me SO HAPPY. 

That excitement every time I think of removing these stupid unnecessary lumps has not gone away & I have no idea how I‚Äôll ever save up that $8,000 MINIMUM to get an elective surgery (especially with a kid on the way now) but I have hope & the thought of that was keeping me going but.....

NOW I‚ÄôM PREGNANT. & the first thing that happened was that my boobs went up a letter in like a month. 34B sucked & was already giving me back pain, but it was manageable. Now I‚Äôm at least a C cup & none of my boobcages fit right, I have even worse back pain, & I‚Äôm always miserable & exhausted.

There are way worse pregnancy side effects than your breasts LITERALLY DOING WHAT THEY‚ÄôRE SUPPOSED TO & FULFILLING THEIR PURPOSE I UNDERSTAND THAT. But that‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs bugging me the most. 

I‚Äôm so excited to be a mom & start a family with the love of my life but also being pregnant is a horrible experience & having to deal with these massive sacks of milk & fat that just keep getting bigger is just the icing on the cake of shit. It‚Äôs really overwhelming & I feel like my body is attacking me. 

I really need help so I can stop wishing I had breast cancer so there was a reason to remove them which I KNOW is a very unhealthy & horrible coping mechanism but my brain keeps bringing it up anyway. 

I was wondering if anyone on here had gone through a similar experience & had advice on something that might help, since top surgery obviously isn‚Äôt an option for a few years at least, & not a lot of pregnancy sites cover these sort of struggles so I‚Äôm feeling very aloneüòÖ

(I‚Äôm so sorry for the long post) 


TLDR; not sure if I‚Äôm Enby but I DO want to remove my boobs & since I‚Äôm currently pregnant they‚Äôre GETTING BIGGER & I‚Äôm miserable. So I‚Äôd appreciate advice or at least getting to hear someone tell me I‚Äôm not crazy for feeling this way."	"Try r/seahorse_dads!
after pregnancy/you're done breast feeding you could get a binder?
I unfortunately don't have a ton of advice, but I definitely know these feels. I wish I could say something to you besides ""yes,"" but that's honestly about the extent of it.

There is a small light in the distance, I guess: I opted to nurse my child and am still waiting that out, but if you don't, they'll generally do top surgery six months post partum. Though of course money and recovery time are still serious barriers. If you want to actually use the milk, then it's six months after actively feeding/pumping, not necessarily after the milk stops being made.

If you do settle on the non-binary/not-cis side of things and use facebook, there's a nice private group that focuses on this sort of thing. It's nominally for transmasc people and trans men, but I've always felt welcomed as an agender person of no particular masc-vs-femme orientation.
Yo is this in the sidebar somewhere? It should be. Thank you for sharing this. My heart is full to know I‚Äôm not alone.
Thank you!
I do have a few binders for cosplay reasons, although I suppose I‚Äôll have to get larger sizes now that my chest has grown üòÖ. But they‚Äôre so expensive/uncomfortable & even sports bras are hard for me to wear because of my scoliosis (racer backs put all the pressure on where my spine sticks out üò¢) so I feel like for me personally that‚Äôs not a sustainable everyday thing, but might work once in a while thanks! ü•∞
Thank you so much for the good info!! I doubt I‚Äôd have money to look at top surgery for at least a year or 2, so I guess I might as well breastfeed üòÖ. But I am determined to get Top surgery before the next kid, because I want more kids but I am NOT dealing with these boobs next time"	kvegv9	NonBinary	8	1.0	2021-01-11 23:00:30
NY resolutions -- transitioning & doctors	"Hi all!

2018 is the year I take care of myself a bit better. This means doctors (for a lot more than just transitioning - life-threatening allergies, progressive hearing loss, a couple of other fairly minor things). 

Before I talk to the doc about being trans/NB, I want to arm myself with ALL the information, and y'all seem to know what's what!

I'm hoping to talk to the doc about hormone therapy - not as far as T, but like an estrogen blocker that would mimic menopause or something. Google is generous with info about AMAB antiandrogens, and full AFAB HRT but pretty limited with the info I'm looking for (could be my region tho).

Likewise if someone has any experience with this under the Ontario healthcare system, any intel is much appreciated. 

<3 happy new year everyone!
"	"Keep in mind that your body needs hormones to function properly - they do more than just alter outward appearance. So be sure to read up on all the health risks related to taking estrogen blockers without taking testosterone so you're sure that those are risks you're willing to take before you start taking blockers.

For getting a more typically androgynous apperance, if that is what you want, I've known a few genderqueer people who were cafab who decided to go on testosterone for just a couple of months and then stopping. Some changes will reverse when you stop hrt, but some will remain, so they were able to stay more or less as androgynous as they wanted."	7n1bxu	NonBinary	8	1.0	2017-12-30 12:31:08
Prob just cis but not sure	"I know y'all get a lot of this but I'm really not sure what I am. I'm AFAB but don't particularly feel attached to being a 'woman'- I don't even know what people mean when they say that. I think my body is pretty (I'd personally like to be a little less curvy but I don't want to be flat-chested either) and I like gabbing about periods as much as the next cis gal, but I don't really know what gender is? I remember when I watched Vihart's video on gender it made a lot of sense to me- I'd also never understood why people cared about gender or transitioned or anything.

Anywho, I think I'm just a cis girl who is personally not too interested in being girly (probably because of internalized misogyny-- I was that girl in middle school who was pretentious about how I couldn't stand boy bands) but the main thing that makes me wonder if I'm not cis is that I do enjoy dressing/looking like a boy. I don't shave at all, I intentionally go to the men's section for shirts, etc. I like looking in the mirror and seeing a really cute boy, but I don't think I'd like to see that all the time and I feel like the main reason I like looking like a boy is because I look more feminine then. I'm a medium-feminine looking girl but if I look like a boy I look like a super feminine guy and I really like that. But I also like not looking like any gender, so long as I look feminine and friendly.

Sorry this was so long and pointless but I guess I just want advice? I don't feel strongly tied to being a woman or a girl at all besides the fact that my experiences are female, like I feel more tied to being afraid of going somewhere alone at night than I feel tied to being a woman. I like my body but would prefer if it was a little less gendered, but still feminine. I don't know if I 'count' as nonbinary or agender  or demigirl or just a cis girl but I'd really like to hear your thoughts on it. Also sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, I'm still figuring a lot of stuff out!"	"If those words feel right to you then you count. Your experience is valid as it is!

I also struggle with the concept of gender and my presentation.  There's no definition for the gender queer or non binary experience. 
Your experience kind of sounds like my own. Though, I'm AMAB so I'm approaching from kind of the opposite direction, but I totally get wanting to be feminine without really being female. It's only something that I've recently figured out about myself, but I feel far more comfortable identifying as a demigirl than as a woman.

But really, what label you adopt is ultimately up to you. Just as there's no right way to be a woman (whether cis or trans) there's no right way to be non-binary. If you feel more comfortable as someone who's kind of a tomboyish but androgynous person who's neither male or female, that's perfectly valid. Or, if ultimately decide that you're a cis woman who just likes being kind of soft butch, that's also perfectly valid.

Labels only exist for your own convenience, not anyone else's.
I'm nonbinary. I'm pursuing some transition stuff. I feel you on a lot of the things you've described. I just don't want to be female. Or male. Or anything. Just me. And that's valid AF. And you're valid AF. 

Labels are just labels. You can experiment with them however you'd like.
Not knowing what people mean when they talk about gender or why they care if a pretty big mood, tbh. You don't have to change your presentation or even your pronouns, but that sounds pretty nb to me."	9mas3o	NonBinary	7	0.83	2018-10-08 01:53:17
I could use some pronoun advice.	"Hello, all. My name is Jamie, and I use they/them pronouns. However, I'm having a really hard time getting people to respect my new name and pronouns, and I think many people shrugged it off as either a phase or just as unreasonable. If it were just random people, I wouldn't really mind or care. Honestly, I'm ok with being seen as any gender, so for me misgendering isn't really so bad, and in some cases I've found myself leaning one way or the other. But these are some of my good friends, including my boyfriend.
    I came out in October, and before that I had been questioning about if I were just trans or nb, and I eventually came to my conclusion, which was genderqueer. I told my boyfriend, and fair enough, he said if I were trans (as in transitioning to the opposite gender) that he wouldn't date me because he wouldn't be attracted to that gender, which I very much understand and respect. He shouldn't have to change his sexuality for me, and whatever choice he makes about it I wouldn't hold it against him. However, I think genderqueer really threw him for a loop. He just doesn't understand it. And since then, he will not use they them, or even use neutral words like person, or partner. He has told all of his friends i am my AGAB, and when I have tried to correct him, he ignores it and continues to almost intentionally misgender me. I haven't said anything because I was hoping to just avoid the whole thing, but lately it really makes me frustrated, especially being at home where no one knows I'm nb, and i don't know if people in my family would respect that. I'm starting to feel like I should maybe just tell him we should be friends, but I also wonder if it's worth the effort to correct him and sit down and talk with him. What can I say to be firm, but kind, about correcting him and others?"	"WHOA. That‚Äôs a huge red flag.
Hi Jamie! I also tried to avoid dealing with it when there were problems with my coming out to people close to me, but I think the best advice I can give is to be super clear and direct about what's going on with you. You should tell your boyfriend that it's hurtful and frustrating that he won't use your pronouns or your name if that's how you feel. If you think a conversation with him is worthwhile, it's best to be super direct and emphasize that regardless of what he might be comfortable with, you are your own person and can make your own decisions (including when to be out and to whom, which it seems your boyfriend doesn't want you doing). It sounds like he's being pretty aggressive in invalidating your identity, but if you think it would be productive to have a conversation with him about it, go for it!
By my understanding, a conversation is a good route to go down - talk to him, first explaining how you feel emotionally and how his actions are contributing to that. Then explain what you would prefer him to do (make sure to try to replace each bad action you mention with a good alternative - this is a very productive move both in conversations about hurtful behaviour and in debates, for the same reason) instead of what he's doing. Explain that your gender is not a reflection of his sexuality, that the term used to describe his sexuality is descriptive and not prescriptive, and so it has no bearing on what he actually likes - Therefore, he has the right to be attracted to you no matter his sexuality.

Hopefully, by the end of that, he will have shown some willingness to behave differently, but it sounds to me like he's pointedly rejecting your identity. If he doesn't show willingness to behave differently, and doesn't provide you with an explanation for his past and future behaviours that make ***you*** feel comfortable with them, then I would be considering telling him that you'll just be friends from now on.

Obviously, you should only follow my advice where you feel it will help you better your situation - I don't know the whole story, and I couldn't tell you with any certainty what's best for you even if I did. The only thing I know for sure here is that if he is misgendering you intentionally or refusing to try to gender you correctly, then that's a bad sign and a real issue for your relationship that should be addressed.

Stay safe and I hope everything goes well. Take care of yourself!"	gk3glo	NonBinary	6	0.88	2020-05-15 05:53:13
Dysphoria on Lesbian Visibility Day	"I‚Äôm Iris(she/her) and I‚Äôm a nonbinary girl that like girls (and other feminine persons). 

That day, I was browsing my Instagram timeline and suddenly dysphoria struck me. Seeing so many lesbians being their true self, being beautiful, and kissing other girls make me envy them so much. I want to be like them, to meet and date other girls as a girl, and have a sweet and lovely relationship. 

But I felt I am not a valid as a girl and I would never be accepted by other women as a girl, or a woman, because I am nonbinary and still pre-transition. I felt I don‚Äôt deserve love and care from other women because I‚Äôm not a valid woman. I felt other women will just treat me as a man and invalid my gender identity, and I will never be accepted in the lesbian community.
 
Suddenly I was jealous of other trans and cis lesbians. They are women. They can live their life as a woman and I felt their identity is more valid than mine. And I thought if I were a woman, people will love and accept me more."	"Considering your selfie from a week ago: you are a beautiful demigirl.

Is it just me, or do other non-binary peoples feel this way too?	"So I‚Äôm nonbinary, and female at birth. And I‚Äôve just started getting into the place in my life where I feel like I could take on a romantic relationship, and maybe even want a kid in the future. (Was previously NO KIDS EVER kinda person) 
But now that I‚Äôm in this place in my life‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm realizing I don‚Äôt want to be pregnant as a person who might be mistaken for a women‚Ä¶. Like to the point where I‚Äôd be comfortable medically transition with hormone therapy. Not while being pregnant (obviously). I dress pretty masc anyways and have a small chest. I don‚Äôt actually care how I‚Äôm presenting myself as long as I‚Äôm comfortable with me, but for whatever reason the idea of being seen as a pregnant women makes me feel so so so bad about myself. 

But does anyone else feel this way???"	"as an afab enby, previously transmasc, I had a hysto. I constantly question whether or not I regret it. I know that getting pregnant would give me awful gender feels and get me misgendered to the max, but I do feel that hole in my life where a child could be. If I hadn't had the hysto, having a child would still be an option. As a low-income neurodivergent person, I know I'll never get approved or be able to afford adoption. If I was still able, a near-year of gender hell might be worth the reward in the end.
I don't want kids and never will but yes whenever I think about myself pregnant I feel so awful like I literally get sick to my stomach(no pun intended lol). Thankfully there are other options like adoption and surgats.

I was recently pregnant as an Enby and I will tell you that no matter how ‚Äúopen‚Äù and supportive the healthcare professionals are they made it worse. I asked for them to not call me mom in labor so instead I got ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù and ‚Äúdarling‚Äù and ‚Äúkiddo‚Äù funny enough the pregnancy part was fine when I was alone‚Ä¶ it just felt like a huge sign about my anatomy when I was in public
 I don't mind the idea of having children, but the idea of pregnancy makes me still very dysphoric. I'm also nervous around it because of working in the medical field and knowing how risky even an uncomplicated pregnancy can be.
I think there is uterus transplant surgery out there, I'm not heaps clued in on it but give it a search?
Unfortunately, I had the opposite experience. I was constantly dead-named and misgendered by the medical staff and they treated me horribly after they found out I was non-binary. It didn't matter how many times I asked them not to call me Mom, they ignored and purposefully used it at times. I guess, like everything, it depends on your specific scenario, but being pregnant as an enby caused me nothing but gender dysphoria and even more mental health issues
Oh one of the nurses I had was like that too‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs really hell to be with the medical community as an Enby. I live in a reaaaaally open minded area and I still had issues. I hope things get better for the both of us‚Ä¶. I just don‚Äôt understand why you can‚Äôt call your patient by their preferred name. It‚Äôs literally written in like 7 places for staff to see for fucks sake"	vw2fg7	NonBinary	7	1.0	2022-07-10 22:07:02
Non-binary or affected by misogyny?	"Hi

I've never been on reddit before and I'm joining now because I don't know where else to go or who else to talk to.

I've struggled with my gender identity lately and the questions seem to buzz in my head nonstop at every quiet moment I get.

Last year I came out as a lesbian and I currently have a happy, stable relationship. It felt good to finally figure out who I am and to no longer feel broken as my relationships with men weren't fullfilling. Being a lesbian is something that I've, over the last year, started to identify strongly with but lately I'm wondering if I'm even a woman at all.

I feel as though being a woman has always been a lot of work for me and realizing I'm gay felt like a relief to that, me hanging with the boys as a kid and refusing to dress like the other girls is something I'd look back at and say ""aah classic lesbian child behaviour"" but now I'm not entirerly sure.

I also remember often thinking of myself, especially before puberty, as something beyond girl and boy and later in life I would tend towards a gender neutral, but usually a little updressed. I remember looking at myself in the mirror at the age 14, going through a hefty emo-phase that was totally not a phase (and yet my band tees are long gone) and wondering if I'm actually a boy. Questioning wether I'd be happier if I cut my hair short, started wearing a binder, change my name and later maybe even transition. My conclusion to that thought was no and that I didn't really care, that I was born a girl and didn't mind being one and that if I'd been born a guy I would probably also not mind being one. I never had any dysphoria that I know, but I don't know a lot about dysphoria. I do however get very uncomfortable at the thought of being pregnant, giving birth and breast feeding and I have a complicated relationship to my first name.

After this, it has felt harder and harder for me to ""be a woman"". I kept feeling like I had to try so hard and so I did, I shopped for new clothes, mostly skirts and dresses and I'd learn to do make up better. I often felt ugly and lacked confidence so it started to get scary for me to walk outside without make up. One time that I did, a kid approached me and asked me if I was a boy or a girl.

The question offended me. I wasn't wearing make-up but I had long hair and dressed in booty-shorts and a women's section top. Of course I was a girl, how could he not see that? I was 16 or 17 and what strikes me about it now is how vulnerable I was about ""coming across female"". For all I know at this point, perhaps the kid was super woke and had learned to ask about pronouns and I think it's great that kids are learning to question gender appearences. But of course, we only feel strongly about small remarks, no matter how well intended if they are pointing out something that we are already insecure about.

Fast forward to my breaking up with my third boyfriend two years ago shortly after he wouldn't believe me saying I was asexual (eventhough we'd never had sex in our 2 year long relationship) and then realizing that maybe I didn't want to sleep with men because I wanted to sleep with women, I started to grow just a little bit more confident in being a woman. I'd still dress in a gender-neutral fashion, perhaps even more so, I'd fall in love with button up shirts and bow ties, as well as the hot butch girl at my new university who I now share a bed with. I'd say things like ""I felt insecure about being bad at being a woman but now I feel like I can be a woman in my way."" And this confidence lasted until I cut my hair a few months later.

I had hair down to my waist growing up but I've been taking portions off for a while now, the shortest I'd had it until last winter was shoulder length but I had decided to chop it all off for a more androgynous look. It was also symbolism for a ""rebirth"" to me. I was so insdcure about my appearence and I really hoped that a new wildly different haircut might help me achieve more confidence but it did the opposite. First off, the haircut wasn't very good and I felt like I looked like a grandma. I don't blame the hairdresser though, I gave her 3 reference photos that didn't look anything like eachother at all because I didn't know what I wanted. My girlfriend then introduced wax to me and my world changed, I'd love the way I'd look with the wax and I'd start liking my short hair more and more. However, the hair made me all the more insecure about my femininity. It felt like it too had been chopped off and seeing myself in the mirror, I'd ask ""they? he?"".

These questions would always be a little bit on the downlow and I think my girlfriend caught on that I wasn't entirerly sure, she asked me if I was nonbinary at one point, it wasn't a serious discussion or anything just a casual passing question and I'd say ""not at this time"".

The questions are burning stronger for me now and I'm feeling more insecure than ever. It feels like part of me is ready to embrace a new gender identity or at least wants some sort of change while another part of me wants my long hair back and wants to be a woman and not even question it. For the longest time, I thought non-binary meant being inbetween man and woman but learning that it can also mean to be outside of gender entirerly, I'm starting to wonder if that's me.

However, maybe I'm not and maybe what's actually hurting me is the patriarchy and societal pressure of what a woman is supposed to be that I simply can't live up to. I might also be stuck in the idea that I can't be both a lesbian and non-binary.

Thank you for reading my story, I know it's long and probably has a lot of typos. I know that no one can answer for me but if you're anything like me, please let me know or share your story, I'd greatly appreciate it. And if you can provide any helpful or useful resources or advice, that would be much appreciated too.

Figuring this out is scary and lonely for me and maybe I'm even rushing it because I think I'd be more comfortable in the known than the unknown.

Thank you

- Toucan"	"I could ask some gender questions if you think that would help
I‚Äôm also struggling with dysphoria vs patriarchy, it‚Äôs such a tough question to answer. I don‚Äôt think I even have any advice for it.

However, I did notice that a lot of your story involved fear. Lean into that. What are you afraid of? If you were to fathom being potentially trans/enby, what fears come up? I thought about that for myself today using ‚ÄúYou and your gender identity‚Äù by Dara Hoffman-Fox, and I found it really illuminating. I recommend that exercise (or even that book I quite like it so far).
That would be lovely, thank you!
Thank you for that insight, I hadn't even noticed it amd re-reading my own words, yeah I'm totally afraid of something... Thank you for the book suggestion too, I'll check it out. Here's to both of us figuring it out one day!
Alright here goes. Do you feel more masculine,feminine or neither
Hmm most of the time neither, sometimes leaning more one way or another
Would you like to be referred to as she/her,he/him or they/them
Not him, don't mind the other two
Would you like to look feminine,masculine or androgynous
Androgynous or feminine, I suppose
How do you dress
Pretty gender neutral for the most part
Guessing from the answers you gave me it seems like your a demigirl. Feeling feminine or girly a little bit but not a lot. Sound right?
Maybe I should look into the term more, I guess I dissmissed it from the start because I didn't like that it had the word ""girl"" in it
Good luck
Thank you so much! I really appreciate it!"	hksyc6	NonBinary	7	0.9	2020-07-03 23:07:58
Am I a Non Binary?	"I just want some advice or smth :( 
I was born as a woman and I was OK with that until i turned 15-16 that my female characteristics showed up. I started hating my body even more (i used to have bulimia) but somehow I didnt (dont) hate being a ""woman""  even tho, I don't feel like a ""woman"" neither ""man"" but I really dont care about pronouns she/her, he/him, they/them all of that it's ok to me
Sometimes I wonder how would I feel if I was born as a man, but i dong want to transition"	so it seems like how you feel is more physical just from what you described? might be more about your body image than gender identity. however, remember that you know yourself best.	jqljnz	NonBinary	7	1.0	2020-11-08 22:54:45
Dysphoria is affecting my sex life (possibly graphic)	"AMAB 32 years old.

TW for gender dysphoria, internalized transphobia



I came out as NB and pansexual about 1 year into my marriage. Despite coming to a realization about my identity and orientation, I love my partner (AFAB) and we seem compatible sexually. But in the last year or so, I've had increased issues with decreased sex drive and erectile dysfunction. I still feel strong attraction to my partner, and I get excited during foreplay, but penetration now stresses me out. Each instance of low performance increases my anxiety.

I'm comfortable with oral sex or pleasuring my partner with a toy or my fingers, but they say it's just not the same. They are more satisfied by penetration.

I experience dysphoria with my penis on occasion. It's more of a tool to me than a part of my body. If I transitioned I'm not sure I'd miss it, but it's familiar and I know how it works. Or I thought I did.

I think I have a lot of internalized toxic masculinity from my decades trying to pass as cis male. I'm seeing a therapist, and trying to work through these issues.

My partner is very supportive and never makes me feel impotent or ashamed, but I know it hurts them. We used to have incredible sex, and I love them entirely, so this has been incredibly frustrating for both of us.

I recently had some testosterone injections, which I've been iffy about in the past because I thought they'd stifle my femme side. Turns out I had low hormones across the board. The shots helped me feel more energetic and my sex drive increased, but I'm still having anxiety over the actual penetration, and finding myself getting soft minutes after getting aroused in foreplay.

We've experimented with pegging (them topping me, which I enjoyed but didn't climax) and as I mentioned, I really enjoy performing cunnilingus and fingering, to the point that I get a dopamine release similar to orgasm (I call em drygasms), but I have a hard time climaxing if my partner isn't fully enjoying themselves. I can't use a partner in a selfish way. I'm too aware of how hurtful that is. 

 I honestly sometimes hate depending on my penis so much. It feels transphobic and shitty to not feel like we're having sex if there's no vaginal insertion. If it would just do what I want, then my partner and I could get past this.

Our marriage is great. We've been together 6 years. We communicate, we are emotionally intimate and honest, we enjoy each others company.

So what gives? I'm willing to try pretty much anything at this point. I just got prescribed some ED drug treatment that my doctors believe will help me get my sexual confidence back, so we'll see how that goes, I guess.

I'm worried my condition could be something that won't get better. 

My partner is a schoolteacher and their job has become a source of constant stress for both of us.

I'm transitioning careers and have been going to school (hard at my age, but I inherited a windfall from my Dad so we had the financial security to go single income).

So maybe it's just stress. I have an anxiety disorder, my partner has clinical depression. Needless to say, as a leftist, feminist, NB couple this current presidential administration is a source of much fear and stress, so none of that is helping.

The thing that sucks the most is how this affects my partner's self esteem and their own dysphoria. And I constantly worry that we somehow are going to become less and less compatible even though we deeply care for each other.

Final note: I go soft when masturbating too, but can usually get it back. I think this is because I'm alone and don't get embarrassed or anxious. I almost never watch porn since I came out. (haven't found a lot that caters to my orientation or preferences that isn't horribly transphobic or sexist). Watched a lot in my teens and early 20s, but cut way back once in a committed relationship.

What a mess.
"	"Sounds to me your problem is mostly mental and/or emotional so I‚Äôm not sure the ED drugs are going to help other than physically/mechanically. Until you figure out what‚Äôs going on with you I imagine the problems will persist. 

I‚Äôm going through something similar with my partner of 4 years (we‚Äôre both AFAB) and in that time we‚Äôve talked at length about everything that could be a blockage, a trigger or even a PTSD experience we‚Äôre unaware of that could be the problem. My advice is to continue talking, keep the dialogue open and keep doing the emotional work with and without your therapist to get to the root. It‚Äôs going to be a long process so don‚Äôt get discouraged. We‚Äôre all ever evolving and this is just the present state you‚Äôre in. Nothing lasts forever. 
I‚Äôm 21 and AFAB so I‚Äôm don‚Äôt have any advice from personal experience. However, I know that there are strap-on dildo harnesses for AMAB folks, both pre-op/non-op trans women who don‚Äôt want to use their own parts, and cis men who want to use a strap-on that is bigger than their own dick, I think? This might be something you could look into and consider, if you haven‚Äôt already?

And/or, if that setup still gives you anxiety, maybe try penetrating your partner by hand/with a toy as you grind against their body, if that makes sense?

Best of luck for whatever you do! I hope you and your partner can work through this. Communication is key, of course :)
How would you feel about wearing a strap-on to penetrate your spouse? That might take some for the gendered aspect away from penetration as well discomfort with your physicality in the process. I believe they make strap-on harnesses for people with penises (spareparts deuce I think) so it‚Äôs not uncomfortable. "	8hbapc	NonBinary	7	0.9	2018-05-05 23:30:46
Request for help figuring out my gender identity	"Hey everyone, I'm writing this in the hope that some of you will share your opinions on what gender label best describes me. I know ultimately it's up to me to define myself, but I'm really just seeking help with applying the terminology given my situation, desires, aversions... and just who I am. 

I'm almost 24 now, and biologically, genetically female. When I was about 18 I began to feel a solid conviction that I was not of the gender ""female."" I began identifying as nonbinary and came out to close friends, my immediate family, and my extended family about it. Initially, I felt a huge disconnect between myself and my breasts, hips, and body fat distribution. I began exclusively dressing in a ""unisex"" style of clothing that leaned more towards masculine than feminine. I sought LGBT counseling to explore the notion of transitioning - i.e. getting top surgery. I never wanted to go on testosterone or to cause my body to have distinctly male characteristics. 

My counselor validated my identity and was willing to write a letter affirming my gender identity and dysphoria, and provided me with resources to move forward with top surgery. I never ended up having this procedure done. Part of it was intimidation about the cost, the health risks, things that could possibly go wrong. Part of it was, to be honest, a reluctance to be rid of my breasts because sometimes I liked how they looked in the mirror, and I just didn't feel confident enough about having no tissue there at all to move forward with top surgery.

A few months shy of my 23rd birthday, I realized I definitely did NOT want a flat chest. I hadn't been actively pursuing it, but self-discoveries fell into place in such a way that I had a tipping point of clarity. Around the same time, my dysphoria about my body fat distribution and hips began to lessen. I more recently realized that men who aren't overweight tend to have particularly sinewy legs, and I realized I actually prefer having a more feminine shape to my body. I'd be incredibly dysphoric if I had the body of Kim Kardashian (no shame, it's just not what I prefer for myself), but I don't desire to get rid of all my curves or the softness of my body (granted, I'm thin... but still biologically female, so hormones have an influence). 

After turning 23 I, as I continued my process of self-discovery, I realized that I'm childfree. It's similar to a gender identity or sexual orientation for me because it's something pretty fundamental to who I am and not something that's likely to change over the course of my life. I also became more aware of what it means to bear children, and with this awareness came more self-discovery about how much I never want to be pregnant, give birth, or breastfeed. I don't want a human growing inside my body and the health risks and bodily trauma that come with childbirth completely turn me off. While I'd be remiss to say a woman who doesn't want to be a mother or bear children isn't a ""real woman,"" I've been wondering if perhaps my desire to remain nulliparous (never bearing children) is one piece of evidence for why I'm not a cis woman. 

My period annoys me. I'm grateful that my reproductive organs are free of any diseases, but I have absolutely no need to have a period and it strikes me as redundant, unnecessary, and a waste of time and energy to continue menstruating until menopause. I fantasize about having a hysterectomy - not just to be free of periods, but because I would feel my body more accurately reflects my internal essence without a uterus. That's another trait that makes me wonder if maybe I'm not cis... although I imagine many cis women are annoyed by and resent their periods. 

So as of right now, I don't want a flat chest. I don't feel euphoric about having mammary glands... while I want some volume up there, I feel similarly about my lobes and milk ducts to the way I feel about my uterus. I'd say my chest is a 32A/34A/32B. I wouldn't want it any larger as I feel it would be unnecessary and just inconvenient, not to mention in excess of my personal bodily aesthetic. If I could have the milk-producing parts of my breasts removed without having the fat liposuctioned out (so that I still have breasts even if they're a little smaller than they are currently), I'd seriously consider that. 

I don't feel particularly masculine. Right now I'm thinking maybe I fall somewhere between gender-neutral and cis female. As far as my wardrobe goes, I now feel drawn to wearing more feminine clothing, but I think I might by sort of overcorrecting since dressing exclusively androgynously for the past few years wasn't quite ""me."" At the moment I'm kind of sick of cultivating an androgynous appearance and want to present more feminine. 

As for pronouns, I'd say I couldn't care less (I don't worry about being misgendered), but for the sake of smooth social interactions I prefer she/her just because I look like a she/her, and they/them can be confusing as it's often plural. 

I recently came across the label ""demigirl."" Does that refer to a nonbinary individual who is feminine-of-center? I'm hesitant to dis-identify as a cis woman just because I don't conform (i.e. I don't want to bear children), but I'm wondering if there's more than gender-noncomformity at work since I have such a recurring fantasy and desire to be uterus-free and essentially have a body that doesn't support another human's development and nourishment - in the same way that a man's body does not. Additionally, I've been considering that maybe there is such a thing as a ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" essence - maybe spiritual, maybe neurological, I don't know - in which case, I'd say I'm more feminine than masculine."	"a demigirl is typically someone on the spectrum anywhere between cis female and completely neutral, if that helps
Demi gender is someone who considers themselves as primarily one gender, but also has additional lesser genders of any number and type.

I consider myself demiguy, and I also don't care one bit about my pronouns.
Does what I describe seem to you to fit the definition of a demigirl?
How does your gender identity manifest for you? Do you have dysphoria, and if so, about which aspects of your body? What is your ideal body/set of reproduction-related organs?
uhh i believe so, but i think you might just have to take some more time to figure out who you are
I repressed my gender for 25 years so my female side is severely underdeveloped. This means I'm probably not the best example of a demiguy, if such a thing exist. I may also end up as bigender, only time will tell.

I'm mostly fine with my male body, though anyone suggesting I cut my hair is an instant dysphoria trigger. How much of what I am now is who I really am I can't say, I'm pretty new to this.

Right now I truly don't care about my pronouns, but I have a feeling that this will change at some point in the future, the same goes for how I dress.

I really wish I could be of more help, hopefully someone else will step in"	jxfs38	NonBinary	8	1.0	2020-11-20 01:26:21
How did your significant other handle your transition?	"So luckily my fianc√©e expressed her emotions and opinions of me transitioning to a more physical non-binary state. 

I will be starting low-dose T soon and plan on getting top surgery after we buy our first house. 

She told me she will love me until the day we die and that she supports me fully. 
And she does. She bought me a new binder as a surprise gift and since she‚Äôs had breast reduction, she‚Äôll know how to help me during post-op and looks forward to helping me become my happier self. 

However, she expressed that she will miss my feminine features. She first fell in love with my feminine self. She‚Äôll miss my curves, my soft features and everything that came with it. 
She said she wants to get married and have photography done before I start any part of my transition. Idk how to feel about it. 

She expressed that although she supports me and will do what we can to make a happier, more confident me, that this is the first time either of us will be going through something like this - that although she will be as patient and caring as she possibly can, there will be times where she might be insensitive or not as understanding, because she doesn‚Äôt understand this feeling I have. 

She said she doesn‚Äôt want me to second guess my transition at all. But that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing. 

I definitely understand where she‚Äôs coming from, but man idk. I don‚Äôt want her to be sad. I don‚Äôt want her to feel like she‚Äôs missing out on anything. I don‚Äôt want her to fall out of love with me, because she‚Äôs not attracted to me anymore. 

Idk. Help. My heart is breakin from thinking about this."	"It sounds like things have a high chance of turning out fantastic, and that your fianc√©e is fairly self-aware and just trying to be honest and fair to both of you.  Give it a chance and see what happens. Don‚Äôt worry too much about things that may not happen, unless they seem to be happening, and then see if they can be resolved.

I can see how the ‚ÄùI‚Äôll miss something about you that you don‚Äôt even want‚Äù can be very unsettling, and if often repeated, even offensive. Set your boundaries where you need them, and try to go for shared, authentic thriving together. Try not to break your heart over an imaginary loss while your very real fianc√©e is offering very real welcome and support. Sometimes we have to allow ourselves to be worth the sacrifices (if it even is that to them) which other people very eagerly make on our behalf.

If she looks forward to helping you become your happier self, let her. As a gift to both of you.
That's not support. That's not even a misunderstanding. She is saying she not only wants to marry you as your AGAB, but even have photos taken as your AGAB. That's essentially in my mind her saying ""I accept you.. In private.""

Shes essentially saying with those actions and words that she wants to publicly present as having married someone else and keep who you actually are to herself. It's insanely insensitive and if it was me it would be a deal breaker.

Now, my situation may be different because I'm dating someone who is also nonbinary. But we've had quite a few long talks about how we'd go about supporting eachother when they start HRT and when I go about my top surgery among others (HRT is unfortunately not an option for me due to health issues). Some things we've acknowledged we'd have to figure out as they come up but we've promised to be a team and navigate them as they do. That imo should be how it's done, if you love that person for who they are, not their presentation or AGAB, all that should matter is how to make them happy. And my SO also met me and got to know me as AFAB, it was only later in our relationship I realized I wasn't. None of that mattered to them, they never had any weird comments about how they'd miss that part of me, none of that. They just said do what makes you happy.

I would honestly reconsider, or bare minimum sit down and have a very serious talk about how that made you feel. Maybe it is some weird misunderstanding, but to be blunt I doubt it. I hope things work out for you.
Well said! This helps me so much. Thank you for taking the time to read and reply!
Seriously, this made me very optimistic about going forward. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Wow, that was really intense ngl! 
We actually had another conversation about it before I saw your comment. 
I let her know how it made me feel and she apologized because that was not her intent. 
She said looking back at what she said, it wasn‚Äôt worded really the way she wanted to say it. 
And after some thought, she doesn‚Äôt care if we get married before or after HRT or top surgery. 
This is just a new experience for both of us and we‚Äôll have to navigate it together. 
She said there will be hard times of misunderstanding, miscommunication and confusing emotions for both of us along the way, but we will make it happen together. 

Honestly, she just didn‚Äôt really understand how one would feel non-binary and that‚Äôs ok! The biggest thing is that she is willing and wanting to learn more about it. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I'm glad it worked out then! That's great. Best of luck to you two."	sha0ru	NonBinary	8	1.0	2022-01-31 19:39:36
I had a rough day	"So the last couple years I have been working towards my goal of gaining independence from my (unsupportive) family, getting a job, my own place, health care, and starting my transition. Well after FINALLY getting all the other things out of the way, I called my local LGBT center to ask to sign up for therapy, and they promptly told me it would be a 6-8 month wait to even get an appointment and then hung up on me. I'm feeling really lost and it seems like I'm gonna have to do this all on my own :(

I'm considering buying hormones online and trying new regimens to see what works, but I'm scared. I just wish I could talk to an actual expert..."	"Hey I know how this feels. It sucks. When I called my doctor‚Äôs office, they told me to look on the psychology today website and check off transgender or lgbt as a specialization in their search function, maybe that can help you find someone faster?
Have you looked on [here?](www.zocdoc.com) as long as they‚Äôre in your state you can find a therapist who does telehealth appointments, is lbbtqia2s+ friendly, and which insurances they take if you‚Äôre in the US. Not sure if it also is used in other countries though, but worth a shot!

how do i know if im non-binary	"idk im just gonna be as detailed as possible: im amab and gay, i have never felt like any true connection to being male but i don't have any dysphoria and have never thought of transitioning. i am truly indifferent to any pronoun, i really dont care what u call me. I  enjoy defying the gender binary and wearing dresses (in private for now) and other traditionally fem things, but i know that doesn't really mean anything. I also enjoy presenting masc too.

I am wondering if I could be non-B cause i've been like questioning that for a bit but I definitely don't just wanna be like a transtrender or something of the likes. cause if i were to confirm this doubt, then i don't think id do anything about it because im just so indifferent towards being perceived as male, like i don't think i would ask people to call me by they/them or anything since i know that just complicates things and i don't mind he/him (or she/her, but u get the point). I also don't think I would divert to a more androgynous look, i would just keep being me, whatever that means.

Maybe if i confirm this tho it would give me some inner peace.

I guess im just scared of being a fake?"	"I'm AFAB and have no intention of changing my body, I really don't care about pronouns either. I consider myself an Enby/genderfluid because it best describes my inner experience of always feeling like an ""imposter"" around women. Of feeling like all women have some secret knowledge I'm missing and that I've never fit or been comfortable in the ""woman"" box. I also don't ""want to be a man,"" or want to change my body but I do have a lot of ""typically male"" personality attributes. If you don't feel cis, you are trans basically. If you don't want to claim that label you don't have to. I'm just now feeling comfortable at being under that label because I'm ""out"" now and not just ""passing"" as cis anymore.
I....genuinly don't even believe transtrender is an actual fucking thing tbh. Most of the time I have seen it used it was directed at young trans kids figuring themself out and DARE to not suffer from crippling dysphoria which transmeds claim is THE biggest indicator that you are trans.

To lay your head to test about ""claiming terms that aren't yours"" I think it's perfectly fine to say ""I am trying out identifying as nonbinary right now because I am not really sure about it but I feel it could fit me"" there is no harm in saying ""I am doing this because there is a huge chance I may feel like this but I am also fully prepared to realize that's not how I feel.""
Without people having any right to be mad about it.
Honestly, imho, the fact that you're considering this makes it pretty likely you're gnc at the very least. All in all, your identity is up to how you feel. Just because you're amab and you like to present feminine, doesnt necessarily mean you're non-binary. However, on the contrary, it can also be said that dysphoria isn't a marker of being gnc either. I dont care what therapists say - you don't need dysphoria to be gnc or trans. Im agender and i dont have very much dysphoria. Im amab and my presentation depends on the day, but tends toward feminine. I dont like male pronouns, but im used to it. I like agender because I've never understood the point of gender in the first place. I call myself enby, but I dont like to call myself trans even though I technically am, because I feel like it means to equate me with a struggle that isn't fully my own.
Labels exist, again imo, to help you find a place where you're comfortable and define your feelings about yourself. So if you're comfortable with male pronouns and still presenting feminine, you dont have be non binary. But if you find that being enby fits you better, then that's fine too. No one can tell you how you feel or what you're meant to feel, because identity, and experience especially, is different for everyone.
And also, I edited to say this, but i dont believe that anyone should call you a fake or a trender just because you don't live up to their definition of enby. I dont want to get too polemic, but how you feel and who you are is up to you to decide, not them. If you're happy how you are, thats fine. If you're happy calling yourself enby, I dont think anyone could fight you on it. That in and of itself will probably be enough to spark debates, but i believe people should be open to the exploration of new identities and to finding who they are, and gatekeeping is detrimental to that.
I don't believe in a rigid binary/non-binary binary.  If you're OK with any pronouns, you can tell people that whenever you feel comfortable doing so.  Whatever you like to wear, that's great, and I hope you feel safe and awesome wearing whatever you want!  You can just keep being you, conceptualize and express that in different ways over the course of your life, tell everybody or nobody.  If you're thinking about it for real, then that's not being a fake, is it?
thanks for the response, this is really cool to hear :)
I definitely agree with the first part, I think gatekeeping someone's identity and telling they can't be x y or z because they don't experience a b or c is ridiculous lol 
I guess I never realised until now that the only people who would be angry at me, an enby person, for claiming to be trans are transmeds or terfs, so i appreciate you posting this for that üëç
> ""I am doing this because there is a huge chance I may feel like this but I am also fully prepared to realize that's not how I feel."" 

i guess you're right yea

thx for the response :))
> but I dont like to call myself trans even though I technically am, because I feel like it means to equate me with a struggle that isn't fully my own

!!!! this!!!!! 

thanks yea i def have stuff to think about, but my main fear is that\^\^ exactly, like i don't want to adopt the struggle of a label when I know i would still benefit from most of the privilege id keep, if that makes sense.

thank u kind stranger
> If you're happy calling yourself enby, I dont think anyone could fight you on it. 

Yea i get this, and its nice to hear, but like for example: every enby or GNC resource ive seeked thus far (excluding this reddit post) has had the same anecdote of a person expressing that they've always known they were enby. they never identified fully with either gender and struggled to define their own, but didn't have the right tools to do it. this is something that i really can't relate to. I think i just never really perceived or thought of my own gender (outside of the privilege i get from it and how it makes me gay/queer). It has always just been something there, like a name or a pinkie finger. But at the same time idk maybe thats just normal!!!! i don't know

also  seriously ur response was really helpful like ive already read your response three times now!! i might have to take u up on that invitation to talk if u don't mind (its ok if u do, we r all busy ppl)
>If you're thinking about it for real, then that's not being a fake, is it?

yea very true, thanks
Not a problem! Obviously I went through a lot of the same things haha. It's a process, and it kind of sucks, but you'll find what feels right with time. Took me 5 years after I let myself entertain the notion of being enby before I finally started presenting how I wanted to, and I'm still trying to find what's most comfortable, so it goes differently for everyone.

Good luck on your journey, my friend, and don't hesitate to ask if you need to talk! That is, after all, what I would hope the community is here for üòä
Im happy I was helpful haha. I dont know that I've had a similar experience to you there, but i have a few friends who had else never reallt thought about it before and who now identify as enby. I think a lot of it is because before we knew it existed we just thought we were weird and that was that, no-one had any idea there was another option besides make or female, and once there was, or rather once we found it, other things started to make sense, i suppose?

Anyway, I didnt mean to ramble, I just wanted to say I dont mind at all if you'd like to talk, and apologise that I didnt see this until so long after you sent it haha. üòÅüòÖ"	iq1szb	NonBinary	5	0.86	2020-09-10 11:49:56
I regret trying to bring it up with my dad	"hey guys, lurker here. i wanted to get this off my chest.

i've known that i was an enby for a while now and I'm just now starting to pursue HRT. i'm out to my friends but not my parents, so over this break I've been planning to finally come out. problem is, on the drive home I got into this conversation with my dad (74 years old) about drag shows that eventually landed on trans people. i was trying to explain to him why some people really care about pronouns and why being courteous to people about it was important but he didn't ""get it."" so i went for the heart and asked him,

""do you know how painful it would be for me if i transitioned and you continued to deliberately refer to me as your son after i asked you not to?""

he was silent for a second. then said,

""you were born a boy. you can try to be whatever you want, i don't care, but nothing can ever change that fact.""

it hit me pretty hard and i started to get upset. he noticed and asked why i was crying, and asked why that conversation in particular affected me so much. i told him i was done, it was over, just pretend this conversation never happened.

i love my dad and i don't want it to be awkward between us but what really kills me is the fact that i thought he was going to be open-minded. so do i just have to accept that this is how it's going to be from now on? i don't want to talk to him about it ever again but now that the cat is pretty much out of the bag every interaction is going to be colored with that conversation and i hate it so much. how can you continue to have a loving relationship with someone who fundamentally refuses to accept who you actually are? it just boggles my mind how some people can be so arrogant about what they believe is right and never even stop to consider that maybe they don't know everything and maybe the world has changed from when they grew up. i wish i just kept my cards close and never brought it up.

anyway, thanks so much for listening (watching? reading?) to me rant about this. i don't have a lot of people in my life who would understand, so i thought this might be a good place to start. i'm bi, nb, and queer as fuck and i know that i'm valid, and so are you"	"Well I don't know your dad, but since he asked you what was going on with you and why that convo affected you, it seems like he does care about you A LOT.

Also apparently he didn't show any toxic masculinity like ""boys don't cry, you are no real man"" blah-blah shit, or did you just miss that part?

I'd recommend to give the both of you a bit time, a few days at least, to retreat and reflect and think about what was said.

I can imagine (since my parents are both 80), that it isn't easy for him aswell - long time those things were ""forbidden"" and ""dirty"" and there is so much hate for LGBTQI+ people still, the conservatives nowadays even try to split the community, so I do also understand that he might be overwhelmed, especially since he didn't have much contact to such ""things""?

For now I wouldn't give up that easily, see it as a first step on a new, bumpy road.

Give it a few days, then try to reach out to your dad, ask him if you could talk about that again and if he would be willing to kinda ""learn"" something new.

I don't know why, but to me he sounds like he could understand if he had the time to process the informatione, he also sounds like a very caring and loving dad.

Be compassionate - to yourself, to him, to the both of you. Take your time \*hugs\*

Sending you lots of love and I hope I was able to ease your pain a bit. üíú

My experience with being Non Binary so far	"2020 was a horrible year. I'm sure we can agree on that. For me, I became more reserved, suicidal and sad. However, one good thing that came out of it was I discovered the wonderful world of LGBTQ+

I realised that I'm not straight. At the time, I thought I was bisexual (I'll explain later). I came out to my parents- at first they thought I was too young to know, but after some long talks they understood. I love them, I'm lucky to have them.

Then September came, I changed schools. This was new but it was ultimitely for the better, as I met a new person (Our relationship is complicated rn I won't go into it). They taught me ALOT and I mean ALOT about LGBTQ+. Then, one day, one ordinary day, we were sitting at the local park when they told me; they didn't think they were cis. For a second, I was confused. I thought they meant they weren't straight, which I already knew, so I sat in silence until they said they thought they were Non Binary. Finally, my dumb brain understood. Like a flip of a switch, I went from confused to supportive. I encouraged them to come out to their parents who were accepting (YAY)!

After that, a bit of time passed. I watched more LGBTQ+ content on youtube. It's kinda hard to explain how I realised I was Non Binary- I just kinda... knew...

First I asked a couple of friends on discord, although they were supportive, they (understandably!) thought I was a bit young to know. Eventually, unable to contain this to myself, I came to the person I mentioned before (just in case I have to talk about them again, I'll call them JJ) and mentioned I might be Non Binary. They were supportive (no surprises there).

\------------

*Side Note: I am TERRIBLE at keeping secrets. That is, of course, unless I need to.*

*------------*

Now. I live my parents (Obviously since I've mentioned I'm young several times already). It's kinda hard to avoid two people who care about you loads and live in the same house as you.

Eventually, I realised I had no choice.

One night, I asked my mum to come up to my room and I told her I had something to tell her.

I was too scared to say it out loud.

Instead, I wrote it down.

Of course, my mum, being the absolute STAR that she is, accepted me. Honestly I could say I'm an alien from the planet Mars and she'd still accept me. I love her.

Oh and my dad accepted me too! For some reason I find it easier to talk about this stuff with my mum-

\-------

After I came out, I was... confused...

I kept second guessing, kept being convinced by the voices in my head I was faking it.

I hated my body.

Even though I should've felt free, I felt... trapped...

Trapped in my own mind...

But what got me through it? What helped me keep my sanity?

It was RAID SHADOW LEGENDS

Lol, jk, jk

Youtube

I watched so many compilations of Non Binary tik toks on youtube.

It distracted my brain- made me focus on others

Slowly

Very slowly

the feeling that I was faking it lifted a bit

no its not gone

its still there

BUT

it loosened its grip on my throat

\---------------------------------------------------

I never realised what euphoria felt like before.

A couple of days ago, my mum was talking in passing conversation and used my pronouns.

That.

That moment she said my pronouns without a second thought.

It was like nothing to her, natural.

To me?

It was everything.

\--------

Next week, I'm starting my journey to transitioning. I'm cutting my hair short; I've had it long all my life. This is a big change, but I'm ready.

\---------

**TL;DR Respect pronouns, you don't know how happy it makes people feel.**

# Being trans isn't about having the same dysphoria. Being trans isn't about being scared. Being trans is all different experiences. Being trans is being yourself."		mnvrss	NonBinary	5	0.86	2021-04-10 02:01:06
Considering not identifying as nonbinary anymore??? Advice? Opinions?	"I have been identifying as trans or nonbinary since I was 15 (now 23) and for some of that time I thought I was a trans guy who wanted to be like a femboy. I have dysphoria about my chest and I go by a masculine name but other than that I am happy with my body and how I look. 

I have wanted to go on T before because I wanted to be seen as masculine while still presenting feminine and I wanted to be obviously androgynous instead of feminine...but I didn't want all the changes of T like the fat redistribution and body hair and hairline changes. I wanted top surgery before and now I want a radical reduction at least. Dressing masculine doesn't make me euphoric and I like femme clothes and long hair and even makeup occasionally because I like playing with unconventional makeup looks. I don't have a desire to be a man or look like a man, I just wanted to not be seen as a woman. 

But this has caused me mental turmoil for 8 years now and I have recently decided to just tell myself that I am not going to transition (with hormones or a full mastecromy) and just get a breast reduction only because I still like my chest sometimes and I am scared of regretting it and I have been beating myself up over figuring out what I want for so long and I feel like I am missing out on life in a way. 

And I know I can make this kind of decision and still be nonbinary if I want and that not all nb people have dysphoria or much dysphoria. But since I have decided not to medically transition and accept that if I don't then people will just see me as a woman forever....I feel like I just don't see the point in identifying as nonbinary anymore. I have been using they/them pronouns for the last 5 years too but now I just feel totally apathetic about gender and I don't want it to have such a hold on my life anymore and I don't care what people call me now. I just don't care at all anymore, I just want to exist and be myself and if everyone sees myself as a woman then I don't care. 

I have had some periods of doubt before now where I wondered if I was really trans or not but usually I would come back swinging and feel more sure than ever for a while. This time, I am not so sure that will happen as I feel different and genuinely more at peace rn but I guess only time will tell

Have you ever felt like this or questioned if you want to go back to identifying as cis because it would be easier to not think about gender anymore? Any advice? If you don't have a lot of dysphoria and don't want to transition, do you think being trans is more of an action/lifestyle/choice or do you still view it as inherent to your identity? Why or why not? 

I've socially been out as nonbinary for 4 years and I love the trans communities I've been in and being in a nblnb relationship with my partner the last few years has made me feel so loved and accepted and seen, but I am not sure if being trans is right for me in the long term and I don't know if the positives weigh out the negatives of the transphobia I have faced. It is confusing"	"I was reflecting on the similar things recently. I'm agender for the most part. There is no way for me to ""pass"". So if nobody will ever perceive me right way, what's the point? But then I realised that the point for me is... me? I'm in desperate need to be free from any gender constraints, to not build my personality around some boxes and guidelines. I don't want to unconsciously follow the expectation of others just because they perceive me a certain way. I don't want to perceive myself as my AGAB. So non-binary identity is important for me internally. I want to experience life as non-binary. I want to be whatever I want, even if it's only for myself and something invisible to others.

I feel like it is tied with my agenderness - I don't feel like have any inherent gender in me. I was trained to be my AGAB and I'm very angry and willing to unlearn this shit about myself. It is hard and I'm mentally fighting daily against identity which was imposed on me. But it is liberating. For me it is a path to grow and expand my personality and identity. To interpret myself in many different ways simultaneously.

I don't care much about how others perceive me even now, I'm somewhat ok with any pronounce. I think I'll reach the point in my journey where I'll care about others opinions about my gender even less. But non-binary identity has value for me internally. And trans identity too, because I don't internally associate myself with my AGAB.
This is a really good post, and I think it‚Äôs really how identity makes you feel. Try it out and switch back if you want. You brought up a good topic about how either identity stills takes still some sort of a conscious effort.

But I think you go by how you look or feel like looking. I would like to go one day as the opposite gender if I could easily change back to be a woman.

When I was a kid, I noticed that I had tendencies to want to be the male figure when I played make-believe, and I think it‚Äôs because although females got to be pretty and coveted‚Äîthe males had more interesting personalities, they had drama, humor ‚Äî and I wonder if it was this identifying moment for me to either want to be male, or just be attracted to them‚Äîand it kind of is both but I stuck to being the object of a straight man‚Äôs desire. Later on I find myself crushing on gay men as well.

So, I decided that I guess I‚Äôm a heterosexual female. Would I ever be non-binary? I would try it for a time but, I worked so hard being female and trying to accept what feels like the lesser gender of traditionally two‚Ä¶But that‚Äôs a personal problem‚ÄîI am staying cis because, I feel like someone‚Äôs got to evolve femininity‚Äînow if we can just more cis-males to want to gender bend from time to time‚Ä¶Then we‚Äôre all non-binary

Oh wow I just went full circle now..
Thank you for sharing your perspective!!! It's nice to know other people have similar thoughts

I would say how I see myself is similar and right now I feel genderless....however I am just burnt out and being nonbinary does not feel liberating anymore and it feels like it just causes me suffering now. I don't want to be bothered when people misgender me or assume things based on how they percieve me (as my AGAB) and I don't want to fight and be confused and frustrated anymore. Being nonbinary feels like it does not free me from gendered expectations, it just makes people have Different gendered expecations if I tell them I am nonbinary/trans (because most people don't understand) and then most people still treat me like a woman anyways. I've identified as trans/nb for 8 years now and between the transphobia I have experienced from family and been exposed to online and irl And the frustrating fixation on my gender and identity...I feel like it has felt more negative than positive to me

I don't wanna think about my gender anymore so I think it might just be best for me to surrender rn and stop thinking about it altogether and stop thinking of myself as nonbinary. I don't ~identify~ as a woman but I guess I will just be that because that is what people call me. I just wanna exist and not hyperfocus on my gender identity anymore and do whatever I want

Maybe I will change my mind again someday, maybe I won't. Only time will tell. I just wanna put my energy elsewhere for now."	s4fmv9	NonBinary	6	0.88	2022-01-15 08:19:03

Hi there!

There are a lot of different labels, don't be afraid to just try some out and see what sticks. It's okay to take some time figuring everything out.

If you're nonbinary but kinda male/masculine, try looking into demigender identities. Demigender means being partially one gender and partially something else, so in your case demiboy might fit.

Alternatively, if you don't like using specific labels like demiboy or don't want to settle on one yet, you can also use transmasculine (or just transmasc). You don't have to be completely male to use that term, masc-aligned nonbinary people can use it too.

If you have some more questions, feel free to ask! Gender can be a tricky thing to figure out. Good luck and happy pride!
That sounds like it could be it! It‚Äôs been coming up a lot when I do some research or ask other people. I‚Äôm just worried about other people‚Äôs reactions. Again, thank you lots and take care of yourself !
Ahh thank you so much !! I've been looking into labels such as demiboy, genderqueer, or trans masculine but a lot of people I know are very iffy or look down upon such labels aside from LGBT and non-binary.

How do you deal with any dysphoria from people assuming your gender?	"I‚Äôm AMAB But not masculine or androgynous but pretty femme. lately I‚Äôve started to realize that most people probably assume I am transitioning and identify as female. 

I don‚Äôt care what anyone thinks about anything else. I just can‚Äôt stand the thought of someone else, supportive or not, assuming I am a woman.

Does this resonate with anyone else? If so what do you do to cope or overcome?"	"Hey friend, 

I'm sorry your going through this, its tough. My advice is to anyone who assumes you are transitioning to female let them know that this upsets you. 

If they ask ""Are you a girl now?"" you can say ""No I'm non-binary I just like wearing these clothes (or makeup/ accessories/ other items). If they don't say anything outright, I suggest having a casual conversation try saying ""So I'm dressing \[like this/femme/ in this outfit which ever is applicable\] but, you know I'm still Non-binary \*and then smile to show its all fine\*"" 

Unfortunately there honestly isn't that much you can do to change the image someone has of you in their head, find the people who make an effort to support you, to see who you really are. And do your best to trust that people respect you. I know it's really hard. I know it might feel like they are lying and they don't really think you are who you are. But you can't change that, you have to embrace yourself. You know who you are better than anyone. You decide how you present. You are incredible and good people will support you.

I'm scared to come out as non-binary to my family.	"Okay so I'm AFAB, though I feel like my gender is a mix of male and female (androgyne is probably the best way to put it) but slightly more male than female. I want to transition so bad but to do that, I know I'll have to have 'that talk' with my parents.

&#x200B;

I know they're not going to understand it, solely because non-binary genders aren't very well understood by most people... Also my dad doesn't really know about non-binary genders (as far as I'm concerned, I don't have a really good relationship with him), my mum doesn't really understand it, and my little brother will probably think there's something wrong with me. My family are kind of meh about me being gay, but they can at least tolerate it.

&#x200B;

I just want to start taking testosterone, cut my hair, wear more boy's clothes (although I do still like some girls clothing)... But I know my parents just won't understand it. I've been having dysphoria as far back as six years old, though due to me getting diagnosed with depression at around 13/14 years old, I barely feel dysphoria or any emotion at that now, because I just don't care about anything anymore... I'm 16 and still haven't transitioned. I want to transition but because of depression, I just don't care... I want to but my mind just doesn't care.

&#x200B;

I feel like if I transition and combat this dysphoria, my depression will go away, because I'll finally be happy with myself. I'm convinced my dysphoria is the reason for my depression.

&#x200B;

I've been considering getting a job, but everything is an effort when you have depression, and some days I feel so awful I can't even get out of bed... So I doubt I'd do well at any job at this point... Also it would probably be hard to hide my self-harm cuts and scars on my forearms due to how some of the work uniforms are.

&#x200B;

How do I come out to them? And by them, I mean just coming out to my mum tbh... I doubt my dad or brother would take this the same way my mum would. Could I perhaps leave a letter explaining it and then leave the house? Then again I still feel like one letter wouldn't sum it all up... Do any of y'all have some good tips for coming out as non-binary? If so, I'd be forever grateful if you helped me out.

&#x200B;

Thank you.

\-Lakota"	"Im not to my family yet so cant help with that but i want to say, try not to think of depression and dysphoria of the same thing. It can be dangerous to assume you will be free from depressive thoughts as soon as you transition, cause it may not work out that way. Id advise to seek help with depression, and have regular check ins and/or therapy as you transition. 

Good luck!
wow a lot of this could've been written by a slightly younger me. 

I'm at work right now, but I'm going to write out a long response in a couple hours. 
Dang you're right, I didn't consider that. Yeah I've been trying to get a therapist, hopefully I'll find one soon.

Thank you for the help! <3
Alright. Thank you so much. <3
My younger teenage years were kinda a blur of depression and dysphoria induced numbness. Like HelleborusRex says, for many people not depression does not entirely go away when they start alleviating their dysphoria. That said, starting to transition *has* helped my treatment-resistant depression quite a lot.

Unfortunately gender studies stuff doesn't carry much authority at all with my fam, so when I came out to them I focused mostly on the science and behavioral health sides of being nonbinary. I showed them articles on the science of [sex](https://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943) and [gender](https://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/daphnajoel/files/2018/07/AmPsych-Gender-Binary-2018.pdf) being spectrums rather than simple binaries. [Articles](https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7279758/file/7621238.pdf) that spell out for them the agreement among psychiatrists and other medical professionals that, ""Certainly there is no evidence to suggest that nonbinary genders are pathological."" I showed them some of the American Psychological Association's basic [answer pages](https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx) and [fact sheets](https://www.apadivisions.org/division-44/resources/advocacy/non-binary-facts.pdf) on trans and nonbinary people. I explained (over and over lol) that this was something I was born with and could not change and that gender identity wasn't the same thing as gender expression. I showed them [articles](https://medium.com/@juliaserano/detransition-desistance-and-disinformation-a-guide-for-understanding-transgender-children-993b7342946e) on how the supposed high desistance rate among trans youth is based on studies with unsound research methods. I tried to describe how my dysphoria felt to them so they could empathize. I emphasized that 43% of nonbinary people report attempting suicide at least once and that, statistically speaking, the two most important factors in reducing that suicide attempt rate are being allowed to transition and having an accepting and supportive family. 

I tried to stay patient and not lose my temper, even when they said misinformed and horrible stuff, while also staying firm in my conviction that this is who I was and that it wasn't wrong. I tried to give them space to process everything and just gave it time (even left home for a month, but hopefully it'll go better for you lol). 

If you have a queer friendly therapist or can get yourself an appointment with one, they could be a helpful ally who could lend their authority in convincing your parents. Ditto your family practitioner if they're chill (though I'd be careful about telling them if you're not sure if they'd be accepting, especially because you're still a minor).

If you think it's going to be too hard to say everything in person (or that they'll interrupt you too much for you to get everything out), you could totally write a letter and then sit and talk with them about it afterwards. 

HOWEVER, if you *are* worried about your safety or about them kicking you out, you may want to wait a little while until you have some money and plans in place before you come out. If you're worried but also just feel you *need* to come out now, maybe at least pack an overnight bag with any essentials (especially medications and IDs) and have a friend on call to come get you for the night. 

Take care. And best of luck.
I will definitely check out all of these articles. Thank you for linking them too.

Yeah, I was planning to come out via letter and then leave the house for maybe a couple hours... I didn't think about it long term. My mum is probably going to try and be as accepting as possible, though she doesn't understand it entirely. I'm hoping I can get a queer friendly therapist too, which should hopefully be soon, so then I'll be able to have them explain it to my mum as well.

I'm probably not gonna tell my brother or dad, even if they do notice my transition. I was considering just telling them I was FtM because I thought that would be easier for them to understand...

I might try writing a massive letter though explaining it all, to come out to my mum... That might be easier for me personally.

Thank you so much for all the help! <3"	aknoe4	NonBinary	7	0.89	2019-01-28 14:01:04
FtM considering detransitioning, questioning if nonbinary? Help would be appreciated :')	"# TL;DR:

AFAB former id'd trans guy questioning identity. Don't really feel I fit in a female or male role in society. As a cis woman I was considered masculine of center, as a trans man I was feminine of center. Very confused. Possibly nonbinary, but feel more femme than masc of center, which confuses me. Any insight would be appreciated. Thank you tons if you manage to read all of this rambling mess;;

\_\_\_

I'm AFAB, with a trans girlfriend. I discovered what being ""transgender"" was at a relatively young age to some other trans people my age; I was 12/13, hitting puberty, when I first stumbled onto Susan's and Laura's Playground. Up until this point I experienced sexual/physical/emotional abuse from (to a lesser extent) my mom and (to a much greater extent) my step-dad. I was always a ""tomboy"" and attended a Catholic all-girls school for elementary school, and felt distinctly out of place the entire time. I was bullied for being a dyke before I even knew what that meant for much of my school life despite latching onto and presenting with a trans masc identity at around 13/14. I lived as a ""boy"" for my high school years and was stealth for the last two years when I moved schools and began attending a \*much\* more trans-friendly high school. I enjoyed it, but similarly felt distinctly out of place (my friends would joke that I was like a girl and that I'd better not ""end up a housewife"" when I grew up). I detransitioned at 19 to take care of my family, which had been going through issues at this point, and lived as a girl for about two years during which I went through some of the roughest patches in depression I had ever faced. I medically began transition at 21 (on T for about a year, with inconsistent injections for most of the latter half of that year as I'd begun re-questioning my identity) and retransitioned socially. Now, at 22, I've stopped medical transition and have slipped into a more ""nonbinary"" identity in the interim while I figure out where I want to go from here.

Part of my questioning stems from my history of abuse. It's a trope that victims of childhood abuse, especially sexual, end up identifying as LGBT (specifically, victims of CAS identifying as ""gay"" or ""lesbian"") and I worry that this might be me irl. One reason I worry about this is my shame around being visibly seen or identified as a woman; it's different than what I'd imagine ""I don't pass"" dysphoria feels like, it's more of a hot shame and almost fear. For instance, having visible breasts or being called my birth name in public makes my face go hot and I feel vulnerable. I feel afraid in male-only spaces, and I feel afraid when I'm with older men. I dissociate frequently (something I didn't notice until my gf pointed it out to me) and often times don't recognize my own reflection in shop windows and the like. This was true pre- and post-transition, when I was at my most and least feminine (or alternatively, least and most masculine). This signals to me there may be deeper issues at play maybe.

Another thing is sexuality. Without being \*too\* NSFW, I have come to accept, reluctantly, that I enjoy and greatly prefer the ""bottom"" or ""receiving"" role in sex. I prefer being the feminine partner in a sexual relationship, and though I really wish it weren't the case, I don't gain much enjoyment at all from being the ""masculine"" partner. I don't feel validated when my gf enjoys me railing her with a strapon, while most trans men I've talked to seem to find it quite validating. I like the idea of having a penis, but this thought only really comes up when I am giving her penetrative sex. I kind of quite like the factory installed parts I have now, especially moreso that she's expressed attraction and affection for my body as it is. The dysphoria I felt before (which would make me cry myself to sleep at night) is almost nonexistent now. This confuses me the most, honestly.

We've been playing around with my gf referring to me as a woman and using my birth name and female pronouns which doesn't bother me terribly, but I don't feel that my appearance, personality, or identity aligns 100% with a woman. I don't feel that my personality or identity align even 50% with a man, though my appearance has always been described as masculine (broad shoulders, narrow hips, etc.) even when I was at my most feminine. I've enjoyed the effect of having a lowered voice due to T, but I also sometimes wish I hadn't started T and that my voice was at its pre-T levels (I don't know why). I feel very, very, very confused and am seeing a therapist at the moment who wants to focus on my childhood trauma instead of my gender/sexuality issues, and while frustrating, I understand why. I would really appreciate any insight from r/nonbinary as I've been told by several trans (both binary and nonbinary) friends that I might find a nonbinary identity/label fitting, and it's something I've been considering increasingly over time. However, is it possible to feel femme-aligned as a nonbinary person when you're AFAB? At that point, am I just detransitioning? I feel confused and a bit like a traitor, and not in the fun gender traitor way. It hurts to admit but I feel like a special snowflake for being so confused when I could just be a slightly butch/masc-of-center woman in the end...I really don't know anymore. I've never felt secure in a cis or trans identity and I'm beginning to worry I never will feel secure in my gender, which sucks. I'm always a bit jealous of my trans friends who feel more and more like themselves every day. I'm also scared to come out as AFAB when most of my current friends/social network knows me as an AMAB person (since I've resumed being a stealth trans man since 2018, and my online friends have only ever known me as an AMAB person), it feels like I've been lying to everyone."	"Hello. I apologize that the automod caught this.
Hi again. Coming back to this briefly while I have a minute.

I think your therapist is right to focus on trauma and past issues, but you're right in that tying contemporary gender/sexuality stuff into your work is necessary for you to be able to start to make sense of things. Is your therapist willing to actively do that, or would they be if you made them a prompt sheet of gender/sexuality stuff to ask about?

It's possible you may find non-binary is an accurate place for your gender to reside. I hesitate over the common narrative that everyone has a ""true"" gender and things fall into place when you find/accept it. Life isn't that simple for most of us. But non-binary can be a descriptive term that's flexible enough to work for many different kinds of people. Femme-aligned afab non-binary is definitely a thing, and it may help to think of transition as not a static thing one does/undoes, but more of a process that needs active decisions from you to determine what sort of body and presentation makes your life better--with the acknowledgement that the details of that might be different at different points in your life.

I'm sorry you're dealing with this and I'm sorry it's so hard. You're definitely doing the right thing by reaching out and seeking to share experiences, and by looking at your trauma and coping with your present reality as honestly and as best as you can.
That's almost certainly my bad, either for doing it wrong or using a throwaway/new account. Ty for fixing!
Thanks for coming back to it :') Deeply appreciated, I recognize this is a long and probably a bit troublesome post to read through, so it means a lot to me. Thank you. 

My therapist has said he is willing to do so but wants to put an emphasis on trauma/past issues. So far we haven't gotten into gender stuff at all, and I am guessing we probably won't get into it until we've worked through older stuff (which is fair). I would totally love a link to such a prompt sheet! I'm never able to articulate how I feel about gender outside of joking about it. 

That helps a lot to hear, I'm very much used to hearing transition as a linear start-here --> end-there thing, I very very rarely see it as a ""process"" that's non-linear. I'm also glad to hear that it's a ""thing"" to be a femme-aligned afab non-binary person! I admit I'm not fully familiar with the non-binary community and I should be researching more. I'll have to do some reading tonight. 

Thank you for your kind words and support, it's unimaginably helpful to hear these words (or read them?) from someone else :)
You're welcome!

Sadly I've never seen a prompt sheet like what I suggested. I've written my own for various topics and they always go something like

- Something that's almost certain to come up about This Topic
- Have therapist ask, ""Does anything related to Other Topic come to mind when you think about [thing that just came up]?""

and repeat for as many things about This Topic as I can come up with.
That'll do! I'll write one up before my next session. Thank you :D"	bawzjv	NonBinary	5	0.86	2019-04-08 18:02:50
Looking for advice / experiences re: T + DHT blockers, specifically how to bring it up with doctors	"I‚Äôve been on T for nearly 6 months, and this week I have my second round of labs + check-in to discuss goals and progress. My doctor is fine, but seemed very dismissive when I asked about DHT blockers at the start. She said dutasteride was something we could talk about if I started seeing hair loss, but that‚Äôs the only thing it‚Äôs meant for. 

My doc knows I‚Äôm nonbinary, and is part of a queer-focused health center with nonbinary employees so I don‚Äôt feel pressured to fake binary goals. But their informed consent does lean pretty hard on the ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt pick and choose effects‚Äù messaging. 

I appreciated that when mentally preparing for HRT and accepting all the possible outcomes, but the more I read about DHT blockers the more it seems like‚Ä¶ actually you can take a little more control of things. And while there‚Äôs still plenty of variation in outcomes, that combo seems to promote all of the masculinization I‚Äôd want long term, while slowing or preventing the parts I‚Äôm less jazzed about.

I‚Äôm curious whether others have met a similar resistance with doctors on this subject, or if mine might be behind the times with nonbinary transition options. Her background is in treating cis men with low T, which doesn‚Äôt inspire a ton of confidence. There are other queer clinics I can reach out to if needed, but I‚Äôm not sure how to ask about their openness to less traditional transition care. 

Also not sure if there‚Äôs the same stigma around ‚Äúdoctor shopping‚Äù for transition as there is for psychiatric care, I don‚Äôt want to push too hard and lose access to HRT entirely. 

I think for now I‚Äôll just continue to be honest about my goals, and maybe bring it up again as a part of transition care I‚Äôve read about that aligns with those goals."	"Hi! I‚Äôm brand new on T and DHT blockers so I might not be the most experienced, but essentially what I did was explain that I want DHT blockers to mitigate hair loss because my hair is a very important part of my identity and gender expression. I framed it that way to make it seem like less of an aesthetic concern, and more of a gender-related need, which your doctor should respect anyway because as a trans person you get to dictate the course of your own transition! I definitely think you could at least reach out to the other queer clinics in your area to discuss this with them, and I would be very surprised if they discouraged ‚Äúdoctor shopping‚Äù given the challenges of finding safe and affirming medical providers. If you are open to continuing the discussion with your current doctor, maybe bringing some examples of other nonbinary transmasc folks on t + DHT blockers could help convince them that it‚Äôs not you ‚Äúpicking and choosing‚Äù? Best of luck!
Insurance might not cover dht unless there is hair loss or smn. Ask them if its about that. And if you dont care if you pay the full cost, tell them that too.
Thanks so much for sharing your perspective, and congrats on starting that combo recently! If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, were you on T prior to that, or did they let you start both of them together? 

I suppose I could try to focus on the hair loss aspect, though she didn‚Äôt seem very open to prescribing it preventatively. I did manage to give myself the worst haircut of my life immediately after starting T, and mildly panicked that I was already balding. But based on my bio family, I‚Äôm not super worried about it. 

Appreciate the encouragement, and I think you make a good point about queer clinics understanding the need to find the right system of care. It‚Äôd be convenient if I can work with my existing doc, but might be worth it in the long run to find one who feels more supportive of letting me steer my own transition
That‚Äôs a great point, thanks! I hadn‚Äôt even considered the insurance aspect, since I‚Äôm already shelling out for T patches and DHT blockers are ridiculously cheap by comparison
I don't know if this will help convince your doctor, but even cis men (e.g. my dad) take DHT blockers to stop hair loss.
No worries at all, I‚Äôm happy to help! I did start T and DHT blockers at the same time, my endo was open to it likely because she does work with other trans and nonbinary people:) you also don‚Äôt have to take the balding angle if you don‚Äôt want, but emphasizing the importance of this medication to alleviating dysphoria/pursuing your transition can sometimes help get around gate keeping doctors who don‚Äôt think you know what you want!"	10x1rnr	NonBinary	5	0.86	2023-02-08 15:52:07
[25, AFAB] I've always hated bras and I really don't want to wear them anymore	"I'm part of the itty-bitty-titties committee you could say. Over the past couple years I started transitioning away from padded sports-bra-style bras (I don't need underwire or any support) to those silicone reusable nipple covers. But it doesn't make a difference because it just feels so.. fake. I'm only doing it so I don't risk making _other_ people uncomfortable - not for myself. 

I'm braless 100% of the time in my house. I live with my dad and my two siblings and nobody gives a shit. It just feels natural. I'm not ashamed of my body - I love my body - but I feel shame when I feel that external, societal pressure to cover up. Suddenly, when I walk out the door, my breasts are no longer just a natural, accepted part of me; they're something inherently sexualized, so I cover them up.

Do I just.. suck it up? Keep feeling that discomfort just to save other people the discomfort? Or do I say 'fuck it' and live my life authentically, regardless of what people think? It's easy for me to say I'd do the latter, but there's so much societal pressure, so much ingraining, that it's hard to accept that that's an option. I've always really cared what people think about me because I want to be respected and accepted. I wonder if it's about time I focused more on what _I_ want.

I'm still struggling with my gender identity so this is all sort of confusing for me. I've always felt this way but now because of my questioning, I feel like it's related. Or maybe it's not. I'm unsure. Anybody else feel this way?"	"i don't wear bras most of the time. oversized shirts help ime
What about wearing a tank top underneath your t-shirt/top? I haven‚Äôt worn a sports bra/bralette since working from home during the pandemic and it‚Äôs been amazing. I don‚Äôt mind the sports bra for the most part and I have a fairly small chest (AA). I only get a bit dysphoric when it‚Äôs around my time of the month and hormones lead to water retention.
I stopped wearing bras because they hurt me... Anyhow, most people really don't care I've found. At most if you have perky nips you can wear an undershirt or pasties, but it's really not a big deal. I do wear alot of loose shirts and sweaters though. I have c-d cups I think, never once had someone comment.
i feel you. i stopped wearing bras three years ago cause i realised i was only doing it, just as you said, for external pressure. in the beginning i only wore loose shirts so my nipples weren't noticeable (i have very small titts, 85b spanish size), cause i too cared a lot about other's opinions on my and i thought everyone would think i was either looking for attention or literally disgusting. but with time i began to feel more confident and i started wearing fitted shirts and even crop tops, and even if i felt self-concious sometimes, i realised no one really looked at me that much, if you know what i mean. and that's the truth: even if people look, and judge (and some definitely do), i don't care. its my body and i'm not gonna hide it or make it seem more ""beautiful"" or ""socially accepted"" my wearing an uncomfortable piece of clothe i don't need.
only recently i began to question my gender identity, and come to the conclusion i'm very possibly nb. just as you, know i feel maybe my chest issues are related to it. but the only thing i know for sure is that this is the way i'm most comfortable.
yeah, oversized stuff I'd definitely feel more comfortable wearing.
I actually hate the feeling of a tank top underneath anything I'm wearing lol. The thing is that I bought and tried wearing a non-padded bralette, wore that under a shirt, and I still had pokies so I modifed it to be padded. It wouldn't really make too much of a difference in nipple coverage.
Cool, yeah I definitely think I'm just assuming the majority will have an issue with it when in reality I probably won't encounter that at all"	lshoa0	NonBinary	6	1.0	2021-02-25 21:41:01
Dear AMAB trans NBs on HRT who can still grow facial hair: what‚Äôs it like?	"[edit] Question copied from bottom of post: have you caught a lot of shit/discrimination for having tits & a bra while still being very clockable as AMAB?

I‚Äôve recently come to identify as nb trans femme, and begun wearing women‚Äôs clothing full time and it‚Äôs been a lot of fun and it‚Äôs really (positively) changed how i feel navigating the world.

Therefore, I am really curious about trying HRT: I‚Äôd really be up for being less aggro, and having softer skin, and having a rounder face and some hips (tho i don‚Äôt care for boobs). I‚Äôm not sure what my transition goals are yet but if men saw me as a fruity dude and women saw me as safe & woman-adjacent that would be cool.

That said, having a Much Nicer Than Average Beard was a big part of my identity for most of my adulthood and i‚Äôm not yet ready to commit to passing / lasering it off.

So I guess my question is: have you caught a lot of shit/discrimination for having tits & a bra while still being very clockable as AMAB?"	"Personally facial hair is my biggest form of dysphoria. I'm working on LHR, and in the meanwhile hide it as best I can. I haven't copped any shit, but I might actually pass, so maybe this doesn't apply to me (passing for me means ""people don't think I'm amab""). Honestly too anxious to ask anyone how well I manage the whole passing thing. Once or twice strangers have said things that made me pretty sure they thought I was a cis woman and noone has said anything that made me think I had been clocked.

But anyway, I think it really depends where you live too. Where I live, I don't think I would get much more than some stares if I looked how you describe.
Yea I‚Äôve yet to have laser. It‚Äôs scary. Not sure what I‚Äôll do in the long run yet but for now I‚Äôm still too scared of the permanency. Also just don‚Äôt want to spend the money. Makes fully passing most of the time pretty impossible. But eh, I‚Äôm just saying I‚Äôm non-binary and keeping myself safe
rn i think come off as queer but unthreatening to men but i‚Äôm worried if i grow boobs but then decide i don‚Äôt want to laser off the gorgeous hair god gave me that i‚Äôll open myself up to a lot of shit / won‚Äôt be able to hide it later

i‚Äôm wrestling with wanting to look & feel hotter vs being scared of permanent changes i can‚Äôt undo!
do you experience any negative social consequences now? i kinda assume with men‚Äôs clothes you‚Äôd be fine.

you mentioned elsewhere you don‚Äôt dress femme; do you ever?
(i think your changes are rad! it‚Äôd be cool to have hips like that)
I‚Äôve been paranoid in public and probably gotten a few stares, but that‚Äôs all

And I‚Äôll dress in the safest spaces - with my mom and sister or my gf and her accepting fam. But outside that I just sort of wear neutral athleisure looking stuff
it‚Äôs interesting how different the situations we all live in are.

i wear high waisted women‚Äôs shorts and fitted or big necklines shirts with floral patterns (the one boring photo i posted not withstanding) almost 100% of the time and have yet to notice any negative attention.

(it feels great, and i think i‚Äôd look even better if my face and hips softened!)

i think passing would be cool, but i think i might be ok if men think i‚Äôm a dude but women see me as trans; maybe you could try some soft femme touches?

in my experience men can be pretty oblivious"	v3a60t	NonBinary	5	0.79	2022-06-02 14:30:20
organizing a care package for my questioning trans partner, id appreciate some advice	"my partner is nonbinary and has recently expressed that they don‚Äôt feel like they pass enough as androgynous. for example they told me they were really looking to buy a skirt that caught their eye at goodwill the other day but were to embarrassed to check it out. 

i was thinking of organizing a small care package in their christmas/birthday gift that i‚Äôm sending out in a couple of days. i‚Äôve already bought a similar skirt that they mentioned previously, but i‚Äôm not sure what else to add. 

i don‚Äôt think they are necessarily looking for things like makeup, just stuff that would make them feel more feminine / feminine appearing. what helped you during the early stages of your questioning/transition? i‚Äôd really appreciate some advice. thank you kindly"	"Aw, that's sweet! Maybe some hair stuff? Even just shampoo and conditioner that's meant for people who, mm, care what their hair looks like (speaking very very broadly!) can give a totally different effect than 3-in-1-type products, if that's more what they've currently got! Plus the femme products tend to smell distinctly different than masc ones, and even a subtle scent can really confound people's gender expectations.
You could get them some nice moisturizer if they don't have it! It's an easy way to put more care into your appearance and might make them feel nice and pampered without being specifically gendered if they like that better, or even ""feminine"" moisturizer. In the same vein, lip balm could be an idea, especially with the colder months, and if they want it to be a bit feminine you could get them tinted lipbalm!
I think this is an amazing idea. With me personally I love masculine things. So I can‚Äôt really suggest things. Maybe dress (that may be to feminine but just a suggestion) if they don‚Äôt have a pride flag or any pride merch- maybe? Sorry if this wasn‚Äôt much help. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It is really nice that you are supporting your partner this way!

Perhaps some nailpolish in their favorite color? Maybe a cute necklace or some other jewelry?
It's great to hear you being so supportive. I started with eyeliner and nail varnish, a pair of tights is a great way to feel feminine. Maybe lip gloss if they want to be a bit more subtle. Hope it helps. Hats are also awesome, berets are cute and effortless üòä
Blush powder has helped me feel feminine a ton, even if it's super subtle!
Hey!
I think there's a lot of different things that can work really well, depending on what they like. As other people already mentioned, most beauty products, stuff like fancy shampoos or conditioner, accessoires, etc can be very great additions. I have a small nonbinary pin on my backpack that I absolutely love, so stuff like that might also be good?
If they dont have their ears pierced but like jewelry you might want to consider getting them some clip earrings?
Since it's winter (at least in my part of the world) one of those large fluffy scarves might also be a great addition? 
Hope some of this helps :)
seconding hair accessories! I've also found hairbands to be a very cute addition, especially if they're trying to grow their hair out and keep it out of their face
oh i should definitely get them some pride merch !!! tysm !! :-)
nail polish omg T___T they love painting their nails !!!!! thank u so much <3"	kkqy9w	NonBinary	5	0.86	2020-12-26 22:04:14
Need advice, thoughts or shared experience would be appreciated :) ! Trans masc dating a straight cis guy	"
I‚Äôve been in nearly a 2 year long relationship with this person. I‚Äôve always been questioning my gender identity but it kinda has been an on and off thing? Then my dysphoria got worse during quarantine and I became more interested in exploring my gender identity and putting a name to it. I mostly feel and identify as male :) (I‚Äôm still trying to figure it out as of rn) I‚Äôve told my boyfriend about me questioning and he‚Äôs tried helping as much as he could; looking up what would help alleviate my dysphoria when I had breakdowns and talking to his friend who was trans masc themselves. He also came to being respectful about and using my preferred pronouns, calling me (insert cute compliment) with ‚Äúboy‚Äù at the end. Overall very sweet, supportive boyfriend. We‚Äôve discussed physical transition, as long as I don‚Äôt start Testosterone and get bottom surgery, he would be okay with being in a relationship with me. Edit: It doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs not supportive of my identity or my decision of whether I want to transition or not, it is simply personal preference to him that it makes him uncomfortable- I‚Äôve told him of the changes that comes with being on T, ex: bottom growth as one of them. He said he would still remain in my life, whether romantically or not because he still cares about me and support me regardless. I‚Äôm not interested in bottom surgery, for Testosterone-  I‚Äôm iffy on it. My dysphoria is mainly based on my voice and build but that could be likely worked on without T ! I just wanna really try and make it work with him. I plan on having a discussion with him later about what we feel comfortable with and don‚Äôt regarding my gender identity. But I would mostly just like to hear about other people in a similar situation and advice on how to be more open minded and such :)"	"You shouldnt base your health on the wishes on someone else, if you want to do something to make your life better or alleviate dysphoria, like starting hormones, you should and your partner should support you. Red flag 

Edit for spelling
Facing a similar predicament with my lesbian gf üòÖ i am NB but i do identify quite masc most of the time and have considered T, but the thing thats holding me back from REALLY considering it is that i am quite in love, and i know after a while, even if i dont identify as a man, i would simply reach a point where she wouldnt be attracted to me any more even if she wanted to, and thats no ones fault! As scary as the thought of having to stop a relationship bc of ur identity is, in the end its incredibly important to prioritize urself and what will make you happy in the long run. Something me n my gf have talked about: we know that if we broke up because i needed to take hormones to better be myself and alleviate dysphoria, we would still be very good friends, as bittersweet as that is. It sounds like youve already had a good discussion, but dont be afraid to talk about the chance of being in each others lives platonically if things dont work out romantically. But if being apart is more painful than dysphoria, then honestly, follow what feels most right to you. I think youd be valid either way, being in an incredibly similar situation I totally understand the stress and frustration of this. Sorry this is so rambly lol, best of luck
Your boyfriend telling you you can't go on hormones is honestly a huge red flag. A romantic partner should be lifting you up for ALL of your transition goals. 

I can respect you wanting to make it work with this dude, and obviously your decisions are yours to make, but IMHO delaying your medical transition for a straight person who might not even see you as your true gender is going to cause you more pain in the long run.

This might be a dysphoric line of thoughy, but please consider it: take some time to think about why a straight boy might not want his afab partner to go on testosterone. Here's a hint: it's because he wants to be able to continue thinking of you as a girl.
I‚Äôm sorry I should‚Äôve made it clear and added that  he is very supportive of me transitioning, just that he thinks he wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable with the changes that comes with it. I always try to be as open and transparent about everything so I told him about the changes that would come with it, such as bottom growth, etc. He said he would always want to still be in my life, whether romantically or not because he supports and cares about me a lot. He‚Äôs not trying to stop me, it‚Äôs just my own mental confusion of trying to figure out my own desires and dysphoria.
Thank you so much and I‚Äôm still trying to navigate whether my dysphoria or desire to stay with him is stronger. üòÖ And thank you so much, I wish you luck as well, you have my full support! ü´Ç
I agree. Huge red flag dude!!
Agreed on the redflag. There's a difference between communicating sadness for change alongside open support in a transition, vs telling someone what they can and cannot do in regards to your future identity. Testosterone takes years to transition, it's not a magical light switch where poof you're a binary man the next day. His assumptions are pretty revealing here.

He‚Äôs not trying to stop me, it‚Äôs just my own mental confusion of trying to figure out my own desires and dysphoria."	t5odaa	NonBinary	6	1.0	2022-03-03 10:11:28
Hormones???	"Bit of a lurker, definitely nonbinary. Been """"out"""" as nonbinary for a few years, most people around me are good with my they pronouns. But there's that social aspect where I'm still ""one of the girls"" which is starting to not feel right as much, as I feel obligated to be one with my group. I like getting ""sir"" when my hair is short (gonna go get it cut soon again finally!) and I like being one of the guys too. But I feel like a full ftm transition would give me different dysphoria. However, I want to change some of my features of this meat prison. I've looked at T and wouldn't mind microdosing or going on it temporarily. Would love to change my voice and fat/muscle distribution. But I'm afraid of the emotional changes (I'm already a fiesty angry ball of queer) and being horny all the time. Some other things I don't really care either way about. But I feel like I'm trying to cheat trans men by only going ""halfway"" and just need some reassurance and thoughts.

Edit: I'm 5'2"" and 120 with curves and a child's voice. "	"I'd say try not to worry about ""cheating"" others; if you are looking to have the level of testosterone effects that are right for you in your body, then that's totally valid and not cheating anyone.  If you think that microdosing or temporarily using T might provide benefits that are worth the expense and risk, you have a right to explore that.
I‚Äôm non binary / trans masc, I‚Äôve been microdosing hormones for 3 weeks. I wanted to try hormones to alleviate dysphoria but I‚Äôm not looking for maximum effects. 

The biggest emotional change I have experienced so far is that I‚Äôm much calmer. Suddenly everything feels like it fits. Like I am me. It‚Äôs been a relief not to be constantly worrying whether or not to try hormones. Obvs every body responds differently, and it‚Äôs difficult to predict, but I feel confident that if I start to notice changes I don‚Äôt like I can stop or pause or change my dose.
There's no such thing as one true binary or FTM transition. A binary mans transition is however he decides to transition, maybe that's HRT and surgery, and maybe it's none of that. That doesn't make his transition less valid. And the same goes for nonbinary folks. A nonbinary transition is whatever that nonbinary person needs to feel comfortable. I have been out for 10+ years, I am on low dose HRT and had top surgery, and I am absolutely positive I am not a man and have not gone through an FTM transition, just a nonbinary one. 

It makes sense to have hesitations about a medical transition, and I would be happy to tell you about my experience on low dose T, but I just wanted you to know there is no such thing as an FTM transition so you're not stealing anything from FTMs or becoming a man by taking T. T will not make you pass as a man overnight, if ever (because passing is such a convoluted concept anyway). I hope that makes sense.
Needing [smaller treatment on area or function of body] does not diminish or cheat other people who need [larger treatment on area or function of body].

People need medical treatment, their medical needs are personalised and different, nobody is cheating anybody else by having different needs. It's that simple.
Thanks for saying this. I guess I just always saw it as an all the way or none option because that's what so many people talked about. I didn't even know microdosing was a thing until recently
This relieves a lot of worry for me. I don't have trans masc friends to talk to about this. somehow I've attracted trans fem way more, which also skews how I've seen myself
Thank you! I would love to hear how low dose T works
Thank you, I'm having a lot of counter thoughts in my head lately.
A low dose gives you all the changes a regular dose does, just possibly at a slower pace. Folks like it because changes come slower and are easier to adjust to, or stop more easily if you only want some permanent changes. It's also cheaper hah
I hear that, lol

I think I'm probably going to start soon ...."	irzthn	NonBinary	5	0.74	2020-09-13 15:04:56
Is it normal to want to transition physically, while not caring as much socially?	"Hello, I've never used reddit before but I was hoping I could get some advice? 

I'm 19 and AFAB and have been a masculine/androgynous lesbian since I was about 14. People are often confused by my gender presentation both in real life and on my socials, and I have stopped correcting them. The truth is, I'm not very concerned with *socially* transitioning in most ways. I'm really ok using any pronouns. I also don't feel a strong desire to change my birth name. I don't care what gender or name I'm referred to.

 The issue I'm finding is that I am suffering a lot from body dysphoria. I've been in a relationship with my gf for 2 years, and we have been intimate, but she has never seen me naked, nor done anything physically to me, I always do things for her. I have always felt very uncomfortable with my chest (even though it's small) and my genitalia. I never refer to my lower half with any feminine vocabulary, only male (even though I don't have male genitalia.) I *do* have a sex drive, but feel I'm physically unavailable to seek any form of gratification until I have the proper body to do so. Not having male parts makes feeling intimate pleasure impossible because I refuse to have my current body touched in any way.

My gf is alright with whatever I decide, but my problem is that in order to get bottom surgery, you also have to go on testosterone. That wouldn't bother *me* personally, but I'm worried about what my family will think, especially since I currently live at home. Even if I move out, I'm not exactly sure how long I am technically under my parents' medical insurance. They would not be okay with this at all. Are there options for me? What should I do?"	hi! i feel quite similarly. i‚Äôve never cared as much about pronouns/names/gender markers as much as my physical dysphoria (i‚Äôve had top surgery and was on T for 1.5 years). is there a way you can ask your parents how long you‚Äôre in their health insurance? just so you have all the info you need? i‚Äôm not sure what country you‚Äôre in and what other insurance you qualify for. but if medical transition seems right for you i think you should absolutely pursue it, and you will find a way, it just might not be immediately while you‚Äôre living with your parents. hang in there üíú	m81e04	NonBinary	7	1.0	2021-03-18 21:37:18
Difficult conversations over time with SO, bumpy one earlier tonight that had me really distressed for a while during. It ended alright and with a lot of mutual affection, but I'm left feeling bad about the thing that kicked it off in the first place.	"**TLDR: What are your experiences and views on being stealth - in regards to 'benefitting' from being misgendered, or having your gender assumed by others? How often do you correct non-malicious strangers? What are your feelings on not correcting people in situations where being gendered correctly means having to out yourself in non-controlled environments, surrounded by strangers, especially in places with extremely mixed demographics and uncertain political/ideological makeup? Do you believe you should correct others about your gender when it comes at a literal, actual cost, and have otherwise accepted being misgendered as a common and normal experience for yourself? Do you believe it is morally inconsistent to present yourself as NB when you feel it is safe, and avoid doing so otherwise because it distresses you to have others openly disapprove or be awkward about it?**

The rest of this is mostly just me working my thoughts out in type, and not required (or even requested) reading. I am mostly interested in other NBs thoughts on the above questions. If you have the boredom/patience/time to slog through a summary of a stressful talk with someone I love who just doesn't 'get it', which started over a lightly-made statement, then I hope you find some kind of value in this absolute wall of emotional-regulation-via-sharing-with-others. 

&#x200B;

\--------------------

**Context**: I came out to those closest to me about 2 years ago. I'm still occasionally learning new things about myself as I go, but after the initial coming out and adjustment of choosing a new name and figuring out which pronouns felt best, there has been minimal practical change to how I live/present, and my thoughts/feelings about myself have been pretty fixed since then. My partner voiced early difficulty adjusting to reframing how he (cis/het male) views me, but that he wanted to do his best to be supportive despite the idea of having a gender identity that doesn't align with your AGAB/sex being something he struggled to wrap his head around. 

I knew I'd have to be patient, as there are issues where his mill grinds slow, but exceedingly fine. Early in our relationship before I realized I wasn't cis, I learned that he did not recognize the legitimacy of even binary trans people, and had a lot of preconceptions based on stereotypes; following some talks on the subject and doing some personal research, he discovered that a musician he respected for many years is trans, and realized that he would be mortified if he were to ever meet her in person and she were to learn about his previously expressed views. At least from the outside, it seemed to be a fairly rapid flip from there to understanding that respecting binary trans people was not about whether they pass, or why they are trans, but that being trans is one facet of a person - and that transphobia can mean reducing complex individuals to a single trait that one doesn't understand or agree with, and using it to justify hateful language and attitudes.     


\--------------------

**The conversation**: We were looking at the schedule for an upcoming local festival that takes place over the next month or so. There are themed weekends with different events and performers, and as we're probably only going to go one day, I wanted to be mindful of what weekend we pick. I noted that they have a 'ladies weekend', where women get a (very minor) discount on the entry price, and some of the vendors run sales (again, very minor), and I joked that if I'm going to be misgendered as a norm, I might as well benefit from the sales.   


He surprised me by going off on how that was extremely hypocritical of me, was against the spirit of the event, flew in the face of me asking others to respect my gender, selfish, etc. This rapidly turned into him to admitting that he has been dealing with intrusive mean thoughts and resentment towards me for introducing a situation necessitating what has been, for him, a radical reinterpretation of language for a special case. That is, there is next to no one else in his life (friends, family, co-workers, celebrities) that is non-binary that he is aware of, or that really ever comes up in his thoughts, save for a couple of youtubers that he hasn't watched in a long time - and  these specific people do not identify as trans (but do ID as NB) and have voiced views/opinions apparently very different from mine in regards to how they view themselves and why they describe themselves as NB. 

He made the distinction between 'performative respect' and 'genuine respect' - eg, he can performatively be respectful towards his coworkers, many of whom are anti-vax conservatives, but he does not actually respect their views, or them as people in general. He admitted that he has largely been demonstrating performative respect for my pronouns and chosen name, but that mentally/emotionally he has not been able to make the switch in his head flip from just viewing me as my AGAB, and has subsequently felt put-upon, frustrated, and like a bad/unsupportive partner on a regular basis.   


I was really caught on the backfoot because 1) I was *mostly* joking, and said it under the assumption that based on the advertised events that it probably won't even be the weekend we go and 2) his reaction was *so* energetically agitated.    


This led to an extended, heavy, talk about whether or not it's ethical to 'enjoy the benefits' of being misgendered when it's the result of treatment automatically applied to me by others; whether it's 'selfish' to not consider it worth my time and energy to correct people and/or stand up for myself in every instance, including when it's non-malicious, and potentially means dealing with a shift in people's treatment of me from neutral to hostile; what I even mean when I say I'm trans, and why I ask people to use they/them and other neutral pronouns.

I tried to explain to him that if when buying a ticket someone asked me ""do you identify as female?"" or better, ""would you like the ladies' discount"" I would happily forego any savings, even if it was significant, by responding ""no, thanks,"" - but because any discount offered to women in this situation would be something happening to me based on a stranger's assumption without a proffered out. As being misgendered is something I generally accept for myself because my instinct/habit is to just roll with things, I compared it to not correcting my dad (who I don't ever expect to be out to) because the benefit of standing up for myself in that situation does not feel worth the cost of the exhaustion, disappointment, depression, and likely increase of distance between us from how that conversation would probably go. This was where he called me selfish, and said that I was prioritizing self-benefit/profit over being consistent. I felt hurt by this, but couldn't help thinking he was also kind of right, and asked if he wouldn't mind talking to me about it so that he could understand where I was coming from in feeling okay with benefitting occasionally from not correcting people.   

Over the course of the following talk, I made a lot of points that he told me were very helpful for him; that he is going to continue striving to redirect his thoughts about gender and language because he loves and respects me, and wants to understand so that he can be a good person who demonstrates respect for other people with experiences different from his own. It felt very worth it to me to have a hard conversation, but after all was said and done I still ended up feeling pretty lame about myself, and ashamed of my initial mostly-joke.\*

I assure you that the below points were not delivered in a breathless rant with no room for responses - these all arose from him having questions and making statements about things he was confused about or didn't understand, and were part of a back-and-forth. Examples include:  


* Revisiting that Sex and Gender are not the same thing; I have no illusions or misunderstanding about my physiology, my chromosomes, my genitals, etc. Gender is a social construct that reflects not just the roles, norms, and expectations of one's culture at large in regards to people based on their assumed sex (ie, how others treat you based on your gender), but that is only *part* of it. It may also be partially innate - with limited research indicating potential aspects of brain composition or genetics having an impact - and is also influenced by your experience of gender within your society (how gender is depicted to you, how you observe others behaving or being treated in gendered ways, how others treat you based on your perceived gender - ie, passive vs. active socialization). Consequently, each person's understanding of their own gender (how you see *yourself*) is distinct. 
* Gender being a social construct does not mean it's not 'real' and unworthy of endeavoring to understand; language, concepts like ownership, money, humor, honor, color, etc. are also all constructs that impact everyone's lives.
* Regardless of cause, what balance of nature/nurture, may have resulted in me being NB, being gendered based on my AGAB has been a lifelong source of discomfort and unhappiness. Understanding myself as nonbinary and having the means to ask others to adjust a few words in regards to how they speak to/about me removes a massive source of discomfort in my life, including helping me feel more at home in my body, and feeling more confident in general. I feel relief and joy when people use the right pronouns for me, and feel greatly reduced pressure to present in ways that are not sincere or come naturally in order to improve my chances of being gendered correctly by others. I would love to be cis and not have a disconnect between my body and my gender identity - but it's not a choice, and I cannot help or change that that disconnect exists.   
* As a modern society we have plentiful medical-scientific data to support the position that once someone is old enough to understand the idea of gender, and is self-aware enough to be able to describe their gender when given diverse language to do so, you are not going to be able to use therapy or medication to 'make' someone cis if they are trans, and you are more likely to do serious harm to them in the attempt; the most effective means of improving a trans person's life and affecting harm-reduction is to support them in their gender identity, including medical transition if desired. Understanding someone's experience when it is fundamentally different from your own is not necessary to respecting them. 'Performative respect' applied in the context of it being a non-coerced choice, caring about someone, wanting them to be happy and feel loved, and knowing that it makes a real difference in their quality of life is, effectively, *real respect.* 
* I am not 'asking everybody to treat me differently' - the conversation started on the explicit premise that despite the fact that it makes me feel bad and contributes to me being depressed, I have come to accept being misgendered as part of my experience any time I interact with strangers in a public setting, and essentially do not *ever* expect strangers to recognize or respect that I am NB because I am conflict-averse. My understanding of the culture and region I live in is that the majority of people will either not get it if I say something, and will be awkward or treat me as weird - or even be outright hostile about it. When I out myself to specific people, it is based on the understanding that 1) it is safe, and 2) I will be interacting with them over an extended period. If I ask someone to use my pronouns, I am communicating to them ""if you care about me and helping me not suffer, you can demonstrate that by changing a handful of words that you'd default to otherwise."" It's a point of relatively big emotional vulnerability for me; there are very limited scenes and situations where I am casually open about being NB. 
* This is not as huge a shift in language (in a historical context) as he thinks, and language evolves.    It is not a new thing that language is developed to accommodate and empower marginalized people, and while language being 'new' is an explanation for stumbling or being clumsy in applying it, it is not an excuse for refusing to recognize or employ it. It used to be polite to call a black person a 'negro', but no one in their right mind would do so outside of extremely specific contexts without expecting to be seen as non-maliciously ignorant at best, or an asshole at worst. (Additionally, even if it represents a major shift in personal understanding regarding the definition and use of various terms, the practical end result in application is swapping out a name and a handful of nouns in an applied vocabulary containing tens of thousands of words - something any reasonably intelligent person should be able to do, even if it takes time and practice.)
* I am not NB because I don't want to deal with the negative aspects of being a woman, or desire the privileges of being a man; I'm NB *because I am NB*. It has unique pros and cons, and as a gender identity is discrete as being a woman is from being a man. Similar to how gay men aren't attracted to other men because they have a hard time hooking up with women, non-binary people are not trying to somehow 'game' society to get the best of both worlds, so to speak. If that were the case, given that trans people and *especially* NB trans people face a LOT of virulence, sometimes even within the LGBTQ+ community, why would AMAB NBs choose to give up male privilege, and open themselves up to the misandry of toxic standards of masculinity? what sense does it make for AFAB NBs try to 'escape misogyny' by claiming an identity that can be legally discriminated against in many ways that cis women are protected from, faces statistically higher rates of violence, and can generally expect to be regularly, openly, disrespected and ostracized for merely visibly existing in a public space? If I were totally removed from society, never saw another person again, and there were no notable pros or cons to being my AGAB compared to if I were born otherwise, I would STILL be NB, and thinking of myself using they/them pronouns. 
* This isn't something that came out of nowhere after I was grown up, or only once I learned about it, or as the result of trauma or sexist treatment. Not having the language as a child as early as kindergarten to describe or explain that I was happiest when people couldn't tell if I was a boy or a girl - well before that had any real practical bearing on my life and I had no concept of sexism - did not mean that I was trying to 'escape' my AGAB. It meant I was happy when people saw me the way I saw myself, which was as something other. That I came of age during a time when there was little to no positive trans (much less NB) representation, and no mainstream education on the subject outside of higher learning, means that despite having always felt the way about my gender that I do now, I was not able to articulate it in any clear fashion, even to myself, and relate it to others until relatively recently in my life. Nothing about who I am has changed, I am merely able to better - even if not perfectly - describe my internal experience, and ask others who care enough to be decent about it to respect that. While it is true that during my teen years I hid my gender online to counteract misogyny (casually, then professionally), this is not an argument against my being NB based on my own feelings about myself; rather, it's a sad example of how patriarchy harms both cis and trans people, and *delayed me in knowing myself,* because behavior I would have naturally adopted in practice as an adult (or whenever I would have realized I was NB under ideal conditions) could so readily be explained as something done by any woman to protect herself because of how widespread and common misogyny is. 

There was a lot of other stuff in there too - some crying from both of us, apologies from him, exchanges of gratitude, a lot of soothing in both directions. By the end of the talk we had both calmed down, were relaxed enough to be joking and flirty, and affirming that we love each other. He was able to connect some things I said to his personal experiences, and talked about being slow to come around on his way of thinking (re: queerphobia) as a guy that was a homophobic teen, but grew up to be an adult that respects the identity and rights of his lesbian sister (who largely ignores gender norms) even if he doesn't agree with her financial/parenting choices, and in his 20s had even fought someone over their using a homophobic slur. 

He emphasized that he loves and cares about me, and feels guilt and frustration about it not being a simple and easy concept for him. He expressed that one of the largest obstacles for him at this time is that he had known me in an emotionally intimate and constant basis for so long by another gender and name; that it has certainly been much easier for him to be accepting/supportive of all types of trans people when he is introduced to them correctly from the start, no adjustment needed. Because he cares about me and my happiness, he does not want personal difficulty in grasping non-binary transness as a concept to be an excuse for not doing the emotional labor of hearing and respecting my experience, working on overcoming outmoded understandings of language and gender, and integrating the things we talked about - especially that it's not *that* much work, and that it makes a massive difference for my quality of life - into his views on gender and language.

\--------------------

\*The fact that it sucks and is a constant source of discomfort and being brought down when people misgender me, and that I've largely come to accept it as just part of being alive, really had me thinking that if being non-maliciously misgendered means a couple dollars savings I'd be glad for at least *some* payout for rolling with the guaranteed bummer, but now I honestly feel really shitty about it.   


I pretty much *only* out myself to people that I am confident will respect me and be decent about it. I wear pronoun pins in environments where I think there may be people that will see them and be chill, but otherwise do not advertise that I am trans. It is a massive source of anxiety to even think about pre-empting other people's assumptions by vocally announcing my gender, because I know there's so many people that consider it attention-seeking behavior or 'wanting to be special' when you introduce yourself and state your pronouns. The idea of going up to pay one vender, never mind potentially several, in a public space surrounded by other people, and telling them ""actually, I'm nonbinary, do not give me the ladies weekend deal"" makes my adrenaline spike. Now that I'm reviewing this conversation, this is such a weird distinction for me; talking a stranger with low/no stakes? No problem casually correcting them or confirming I'm NB. Announcing I am NB during a service transaction to turn down an automatic benefit, where other people may overhear me and potentially judge me for saying I'm trans? S T R E S S. WTF is that? 

I guess it's a matter of freely given consent vs. being compelled to say something to ask for different treatment. In this hypothetical scenario, I *have* to out myself to be treated differently, vs. being able to pick and choose the people I say anything to. I'm just trying to live my life. I'm not trying to be a representative or ambassador for queer and/or nonbinary people. I don't want to be seen as 'an angry trans person' for just speaking up.

 I don't want people who weren't doing anything intentionally rude and were in fact trying to do something nice for me to feel like I'm shaming them or want them to feel bad for an honest mistake. I don't want to have to pick between being vulnerable and doing the emotional labor for stranger after stranger, correcting them and endeavoring to make sure they *know* I'm not shaming them; or being an emotionally calloused hard-ass in every novel interaction, who by default assumes the worst and just corrects/demands proper pronouns without trying to soften a perceived attack/complaint/whatever the fuck a minor correction can come across like - at least to a cis person that doesn't know better, might not even care, or because they're not getting to know any developed image of *me* beyond my stated gender in the moment, might even carry that perceived criticism forward in their views of trans people as demanding/fragile/entitled/etc. 

I understand and advocate on the importance of representation, provided by figures that consent to standing up and for others - but I'm not trying to *be* that representation. Even so, a couple dollars should definitely be worth it to me to be able to have a moment where I can say ""no thanks, I'm not a woman,"" and the worst thing that probably happens is I get a 'look', right?   


After typing this all out I think I've honestly swung around to his side in regards to moral consistency on the initial issue; I don't care about being liked or approved of by bigoted assholes. If someone disrespects me on the basis of my being NB, they are a bigoted asshole, and I shouldn't allow people to give me special benefits out of the fear that they will reveal themselves to be an asshole if I turn said benefits down. Someone working a public event where image and service is very much part of their profitability is not going to make a big scene or turn me away, and if I can have skin thick enough to handle accepting being non-maliciously misgendered as a norm, I should be able to handle some dirty looks or temporary awkwardness with strangers. It's definitely not a pleasant imagining the scenario of volunteering to pay more AND someone even just with their face expressing that they don't approve of my existence - basically *paying* to have someone disrespect me on purpose. But, I believe in the idea (the social construct, heh) of integrity - and I suppose I could reframe that scenario for myself as someone having to take my money and respect my gender even if they don't want to, which does have *some* appeal.   


Part of me is still protesting - ""the entire commercial intention of things like Ladies Weekend is to attract a greater number of people with tits wearing corsets in order to draw more people attracted to tits and corsets, and since I like any excuse to wear a corset and definitely have visible tits that look good with a corset, I should be allowed to benefit from the intention of this event if I attend and am misgendered on sight without being given an option before charge! It's absurd to expect people to out themselves when they are not comfortable!"" 

\\- BUT, I think there is a larger part that feels this is less a question of ethics in regards to profiting from the normalized/accepted experience of being misgendered, and a personal moral question of what my dignity and identity - my integrity - is worth, in terms of being true to who I am, and how I want to be seen/treated. If I would turn down the benefit when asked, I feel I should reject it even when it is offered based on assumption, especially when the benefit is not so big as to prevent me from enjoying myself even if I cannot access it."	"Ah. How I know these conversations well.

Demanding consistency from closeted and/or marginalized people is a pretty common easy out. As you say, there are situations where you feel in control and comfortable being out and situations where you fear consequences. That‚Äôs rational and speaks to the position you‚Äôre in where you stand to lose agency and power in specific interactions based on a short sequence of information exchange. Also, as you say, you‚Äôre not nonbinary because you want people to see you as nonbinary. You want people to see you as nonbinary because you‚Äôre nonbinary. People fixate on a lack of what they consider acceptable symptoms over acknowledging that there‚Äôs a hell of a lot going on internally that‚Äôs invisible. We see our own actions as being driven by our motivations and personalities and other peoples motivations and personalities as being defined by their actions. By virtue of being brains that see only external outcomes and ALL of us having asymmetric information in encounters, our worldview can easily sidestep new information that should inform a change, and we can hold two competing concepts at the same time without rationalizing these discrepancies with each other.

And then it‚Äôs so much more fraught when you‚Äôre sitting there thinking the person you love and rely on quite a bit has fundamentally misunderstood you and is judging you to be lacking or has determined you‚Äôre incorrect about your own being.

My actual answers to your questions:

Experiences and views on being stealth: I use the terminology closeted instead of stealth, as I generally see stealth to mean someone who has undergone some form of transition and is now living in a manner where they are nearly always/usually perceived as the gender they are and they hide their transgender status. A trans man whose friends and coworkers do not know he isn‚Äôt a cis man is said to be ‚Äústealth‚Äù. But obviously I know what you mean. I live the bulk of my life in a manner that a majority of people who know me would not be able to accurately say my gender. I go to work allowing people‚Äôs presumptions to be left unchecked. I eat at restaurants and don‚Äôt correct any gendered titles. I have a specific sphere of people who I have informed of more accurate information about me and I enjoy the ability to socialize with them in a manner that feels more suitable and less like a lie. But I have plenty of friends who call me the wrong pronouns and who I fear informing them of this part of me. Partly, I want to keep my job as it is today. I think I‚Äôd have a strong argument for some form of justice if I were to be outed and lose my job, but say I was instead to merely lose the trajectory of my path and the respect of my colleagues. Selfish of me? I suppose. I also have dependents who rely on me though. How can I casually risk our housing, our stability, on a reward that may only cause me emotional pain? Certainly, if there were some external force that makes this irrelevant I would think long and hard about coming out broadly before seeking new employment, and beginning a new chapter where I am assured I can be out because I already am. But that‚Äôs not where I am today. I am already a ‚Äútrailblazer‚Äù in the gender people assume I am. I am not able at this time to be a martyr for gender at the potential expense of the safety of my wife. I‚Äôve talked about passing privilege a couple times recently, I do not see it as an actual privilege. It is easily lost, the benefits of being seen as a cisgender person are at constant risk when you do not naturally enjoy them. Further, they come at an emotional and personal cost. I sit here feeling not a little shame and guilt that I can‚Äôt eschew what I see as my personal responsibilities for the chance to make a difference in some unknown persons life, some nonbinary person whose path would be made easier because I was out and suffered the first consequences that were then rectified. Do I benefit from being seen as cisgender? Clearly I believe I do as I am *afraid* of not being seen as such. Is that benefit the same as one who is actually cisgender? Certainly not.

Further, even if I was out, in my profession there are organizations for women in order to help right imbalances of power and access to higher rungs on the corporate ladder. So, should I decline to join these groups because I am not a woman, or should I join and partially benefit from them because there is no alternative? I am sure many people on this sub understand the dilemma. It is painful and dysphoric and heartbreaking to receive recognition and applause for being a thing you‚Äôre not and having to swallow those negative emotions to be cheerful and gracious and humble but eager. And even further, there is guilt from the concept of taking someone‚Äôs place, a place that I have earned, yes, but under some forms of deceit. I admire these organizations, I applaud these women, I work with these groups just for the purpose of being an ally to women and helping these groups achieve their goals. And it‚Äôs all tied up in a lot of difficult emotion because I cannot do that part and also be openly myself. Not because they would categorically reject me, I think they are not so understanding as to see that continuing to welcome nonbinary people who have been closeted without changing the mission of the group is a statement of still seeing these people as women in some form.

You can see I‚Äôm sure that I have many more thoughts on this that I‚Äôm only brushing upon. I think about this too much and I just try to give myself grace and patience and know that I really am trying to balance out my goals and reach the best outcomes for me and others.

How often do I correct non-malicious strangers? Essentially never. I don‚Äôt find it to be all that affirming to my gender and place in the world to correct people who I won‚Äôt continue having in my life in a personal way.

Outing myself in uncontrolled environments: I recently met up with a college friend and his girlfriend. He theoretically knew I was nonbinary when we were in college but I didn‚Äôt enforce pronouns or terms of address. I lived in the southern US, and faced threats and physical violence being out, it was not the best first couple years being newly out as nonbinary. Flash forward again to our recent meet up. I wore a pronoun pin. That was the extent of me enforcing my proper terms of address to someone who already theoretically knew, even if he had never practically demonstrated that knowledge. You can probably extrapolate now that I am very cautious before disclosing being nonbinary in any situation where I do not feel entirely safe and have some measure of control. I do however get very open when I‚Äôm drunk and so I have to be cautious sometimes about how open and carefree I feel, because I risk letting loose not just my secrets but the secrets of those I love. Again, it‚Äôs a safety thing drilled into me from prior times when I was demonstrably unsafe. As was my wife, being a trans woman married to a person who isn‚Äôt a woman (still at this time she is also closeted and not actively pursuing obvious forms of transition).

Cost of correcting strangers: I very firmly do not believe it is ever our responsibility to out ourselves. This is personal information about us that carries stigma. It is not our job to take on the risk and potential consequences that arise because of other people‚Äôs bigotry and our lack of visibility and position in broader society. I‚Äôm speaking about two costs here: 1) the actions of bigoted people intentionally causing us harm whether physical, social, economic, or other; 2) the structural lack of power that comes from being part of a marginalized class within our current system. Say I were a person living in another time in a culture that accepted the possibility that people are not always men or women and that allowed people like me to fill a suitable role in the community. As an accepted member of society I wouldn‚Äôt face the same bigotry and I wouldn‚Äôt be de facto excluded from access to the applicable forms of power a person like me could employ. Then there would be little to no reason for me to not disclose my personal information, and yet it would still be my right, at least in my worldview, to choose what information to share with others and when & how. Back in current reality, I see myself having the same right to privacy with none of the protections of a community that accepts me.

Moral consistency: I do not argue morality. I don‚Äôt really understand it. Not in a pathological way, I just mean that I haven‚Äôt examined it as deeply as other concepts. My own code though, and what I would advise any young person, has no qualms about being out and open in situations where I am not literally in danger, and then to shield and close myself off when it seems there is no longer a fair chance at safety. Again, I‚Äôm largely shaped by the experiences I‚Äôve had where my secrecy kept me from being beaten and my lack of secrecy made me have to defend myself from being attacked. But there are psychological and emotional forms of attack and I think that protection from these is just as vital. You have the right to live your life in a manner that protects you, that suits you. You have the right to make decisions about your personal information, balancing risk and benefit. I *should not* feel ashamed for being closeted. It is not within my ability as one person to overcome transphobia and nonbinary erasure by being so open and out that I lose my shot at having a happy life.
Mhhhhh I mean, from my perspective I don't consider it realistic or practical to correct people in the first place? No one really knows what non-binary is, and I'm not particularly interested in taking a half hour to explain it just so I can be like ""anyway that's why you shouldn't call me a woman"" or whatever. I share my preferred pronouns occasionally and frankly that's about it, and it just isn't the end of the world if people use other ones.

As far as being stealth goes, I frankly don't even really understand the issue. Why would one have a moral or practical obligation to out themselves as identifying as transgender or non-binary to strangers? Cis people don't explain to everyone that they're cis, why should we? 

Now if you were a trans man and actively correcting people to say you were a woman, that might be a different matter as it's lying and all, but I don't see any sane reason why it would be somehow wrong for you to present as either binary gender, with all the baggage that comes along with that. Not like anyone is offering non-binary specific deals anyway lmao.

Obviously if you prefer not to and WANT to speak up about it, that's all well and fine, but he does understand that if you go up to people and say ""oh I'm not a woman"" they're going to both be very confused and think you're a cis man in drag or something, right?
I really appreciate your thorough answer, thank you. I don't have many NB people to talk to irl (actually may have been unpersoned by one recently :/) so it means a lot to be able to hear directly related feelings and experiences regarding gender and it's impact on your life."	p8234q	NonBinary	7	1.0	2021-08-20 09:53:42
Feeling pressure with choosing pronouns and coming out at work	"I‚Äôm wondering if any other non binary people here struggle with the social pressure to conform to being a binary trans person. I use they/them and I‚Äôm enby but I‚Äôm on hrt(AMAB). I‚Äôve considered changing my pronouns to she/they just to avoid being called he/him but then it feels like they are no longer MY pronouns. 

I also work in a super cis male dominated work space where ppl have been openly bigoted in general and I have to call them out when I have the capacity to. When I get a strong grip on my position at work I‚Äôm planning on coming out but I truly feel like nobody will use they/them for me, but maybe will use she/her. Also, part of me doesn‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm called he him in a work context it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm pretty or fem when I‚Äôm at work, I‚Äôm extremely gender fluid and work isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúfashion show‚Äù as the boys call it, all my work clothes get dirty and grimy anyways 

Also, Does anyone else feel like ‚Äúbinary‚Äù pronouns are easier for cis ppl than they/them? I‚Äôve been told by even other binary trans ppl that they them isn‚Äôt real and cis ppl around me refuse to acknowledge nonbinary but say they understand transitioning from one gender to the other. Sometimes it just feels like it would be easier to be a binary trans person than to hold firm in position as non-binary, not to belittle the struggles of any trans person.

*sigh* does anyone else feel this?"	"I definitely think you have valid points and I sympathize with the scenarios you‚Äôre dealing with. Hang in there and be kind to yourself!

I think non-binary stuff, ‚Äúthey/them,‚Äù and other pronouns are still confusing for some people and so those people either ignore it and/or don‚Äôt want to learn things that are new to them. 

It also sounds like you have a pretty rough work environment. I would be totally exhausted from that so I‚Äôm impressed with your fortitude in sticking it out!"	zxjcc5	NonBinary	4	0.84	2022-12-28 20:01:38
Deciding whether or not to socially transition when you don‚Äôt care about gender at all	"It‚Äôs useless to try to define gender as something innate, so I choose to define it descriptively (as it‚Äôs actually used and is most useful) as opposed to descriptively. So this is controversial but, for example, I don‚Äôt think a person can be a woman if they‚Äôre living as a man and not saying they‚Äôre a woman (however, she becomes a woman the second she says she is one.) All this to say:

I am, right now, living as a woman so I am one. It does not bother me when someone refers to me as ‚Äúshe‚Äù. I am completely comfortable with any pronoun. To me, being gendered by others feels like they‚Äôre putting a colored napkin on my head. They seem to care a lot about the napkin on my head. I don‚Äôt. Whether or not there‚Äôs a napkin on my head, I am imayilingualbay and I feel that that shows through no matter what color the napkin on my head is. You can‚Äôt see the top of my head but you can see my face and understand how I think and feel.

But, you know, I‚Äôd like to dress masculinely and use other pronouns and wear binders and stuff without a big fuss.  I am a woman right now because it‚Äôs easy for me and I don‚Äôt experience dysphoria. 

In terms of my own gender, though, I feel nothing. So I started using all pronouns and now people make a fuss and I am more aggressively forced into gender roles than I was before and I‚Äôm debating just not transitioning since I don‚Äôt feel dysphoria"	"I think you just put into words what I've been trying to understand about my gender
I don't see it as transitioning, rather as expressing myself the way I've always wanted to and doing the things I've always held myself back from because y chromosome.  If people want to assign gender to it that's fine but I've more or less stopped caring.
[deleted]
It feels like I‚Äôm trying to make some sort of statement about gender (or people think I am). I get how you feel; when you say you‚Äôre comfortable with all pronouns ppl get confused and your gender is automatically invalidated"	10kkjg2	NonBinary	5	1.0	2023-01-25 00:03:23
Any tips on how to come out as nb to my boyfriend?	"So my boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years and he is very straight. While he‚Äôs chill with different sexualities and he‚Äôs gotten a lot more understanding about binary trans identities, and he‚Äôs never misgendered my non-cis friends (at least to me, on the infrequent occasion it comes up), he‚Äôs still pretty confused on the whole non-binary thing as a general idea. 

Problem is, I‚Äôm non-binary, use they/them pronouns and I‚Äôve started to transition to that socially here at my college (we‚Äôre in a LDR) but I feel the need to come out to my boyfriend before I go home for the summer. I‚Äôm so worried that he won‚Äôt be able to understand my identity and it‚Äôll start something between us. Idk exactly what to expect since he‚Äôs still very much stuck in that conflating sex and gender thing, but I love him and care about him and I want him to accept me fully as who I am. 

I guess any ideas of how to broach the subject? Or how to say it/explain it/etc? Tips or experience to share?"	"I think that it might be best to tell him in person if possible, or skype/phone call. Give him some time to process, answer any questions he might have, ask him how he feels. He might accept it right away, might be a little confused but you try to understand anyway, he might get upset. It's ok if he doesnt ""get it"" as long as he still loves and respects you. But if he intentionally misgenders you or is really unaccepting, I think you should try to give him some time just in case hes just not sure how to react properly. If hes still upset later, I'm sorry but honey hes not worth it. Being yourself is far more important than being in a relationship with someone who can't accept you.

Quastining? ME of all people?	"So I thought I was always comfterble being a girl, though not being girly, I don't have dysphoria, and to tell the truth, I never thought about me being a girl in any sense of the way, It's like... my state of being? Like, ""well it's fine, it's what it is."" and that's that.

and then I found the term Agender.

the feeling of the sort of ""disconnect"" but not exactly from your body, that your'e just like ""yea"" why not, I can be girl, IDC so much.

Though I felt it wasn't always fitting, and then I found demiAgender, and it was so strange, like I didn't know it existed, I just added ""demi"" to ""agender"" on google beacuse that's what I felt my state of being is, I didn't serch through genders and such to find a 'fit"" I found it by accident and just by the way I thought on myself, and now I'm kinda confused? like, I still like ""she/her"" and I'm not planng to do any transition (mainly cuse, as I said, I don't really care about mu state of being, that's.. the whole agender point, I guess)

I don't think I have any dysphoria, but especially around middles school and high school I was concuness around my cheast area, I felt... werid that it was ""too big"" for me, I really didn't like it, like it wasn't suppose to be like that, which was like  what/ and sometimes I felt like strange in my own skin, like an elephent in a glass store or something like that, like my own body isn't little enough as it suppose to be? and sometimes I was weirded out by girl clouths, like, I didn't care to wear girls/boys whatever cloths, but sometimes I was like ""Hmmmmmm dress is weird on me, why is that?"" and sometimes I don't mind it beacuse I'm kinda disconnected wearing it.

but I came hear to ask what is your opinion, I will probably not identify in the slightest with ""trans"" or ""NB"" beacuse, I mean, I'm not, I don't have dysphoria or any crippilig feeling or something like that and I don't really care about my pronoun, I'm nutral with my ""she/her"" but it's nice to know that the way I felt towards my body all this time has a name."	"Jsyk: dysphoria is not needed to identify as trans or nonbinary. Gender does not need to be based on ""how much you hate your body"" some people want to change parts about it and some don't, but it's really more about what YOU feel fits you best. üôÇ happy for you that you have found a term to describe yourself with though.

putting a little more boy in tomboy femme - considering low dose testosterone	"i came to understand my gender as nonbinary within the last few weeks, and i didn't think that really changed anything for me as i am but was more about the way that i relate to myself and to the world, how i move and act in it, and that i am generally happy with the way i look. But then thinking about it more, although it is true I also do experience gender dysphoria. i love my anatomy, absolutely. It's the bomb.com. But the things that always seem to preoccupy my mind whether i'm alone or (especially) with others are generally the more feminine leaning secondary traits - my voice, my mouth and chin / jawline, the fact that i can exercise 6 days a week, eat well, and take care of myself and still i will have the same body type that ive had since i was 16, and the way that i carry myself. i constantly feel acutely, hyperaware of these things among others in a way that has been a source of huge anxiety and unhappiness in so many aspects of my life and my relationships. 

i have no desire to transition to male. And being androgynous also isnt really the goal. i still love the feminine things about me and i feel good embodying that femininity in some ways. it just feels...too much when it comes to my foundation, my structure. the way that the world perceives me is not quite where it should be to align with who i am...for them to *see* me.

it occurred to me, while trying to find a more lasting yet not so invasive solution to my menstrual pains, that testosterone might help me achieve a milder period. so naturally when i searched for some answers an article about microdosing testosterone for people whose gender is nonbinary and it sounded like a dope deal. i mean all of the people in the photos were styled more masculine than me (or than id want to be), but the physical characteristics were along what id like to achieve.

but a lot of the resources and even threads on here are still a little more to the androgynous than i am or would like to be, and so its difficult to gauge if this is actually something i want to pursue. i have a doctor's appointment with someone specializing in trans medicine, but im doubtful ill be able to convey why it is im interested in trying low doses of testosterone and what my goals are. many thanks if you chose to respond <3"		k55b2a	NonBinary	6	1.0	2020-12-02 08:11:16
Depressed and feeling like crap. Nothing seems right. Help?	"Just been having periods of feeling really confused and low and crappy about myself lately, in between periods of feeling like I have it all figured out. Gender identity was literally nothing I ever thought about until a week or two ago, but now I can't seem to figure it out. 

I guess this all started because I perceive women to have more ""fun"" and be more ""free"" in their personalities and self-expression. I've wanted to do things like dye my hair and wear more jewelry (sometimes leaning towards the cutesy feminine side), but none of that feels right as a ""man."" At the same time, I don't hate my body or penis, don't feel a desire to have breasts, don't even feel like shaving my facial hair, and makeup or women's clothes don't really interest me. 

I don't even know what the point of this post is other than maybe to get these things off my chest. I've already brought it up to my wife and other than not being attracted to me if I transition fully (I don't care or plan to), she doesn't really care. But I'm not sure how to be happy with myself no matter what I do. I feel like I was just fine with myself until I opened a can of worms by reading stuff on reddit. Perhaps I've just internalized gender roles and expectations so much (conservative Christian upbringing) that this sadness and depression is simply my way of coming to terms with it and it will go away. Perhaps I am not struggling with gender identity at all but rather with the confidence to allow me to be myself. Idk anymore, send hugs ü•∫üò•"	"Why cant you dye your hair? Heck, try out some of the Colorista temporary hair sprays and see if you like it first, they're super cheap and if it isnt your jam just wash it out! I've seen a lot more masculine folks playing with color lately and it's great!
Internalized gender norms and a lack of self-confidence I suppose.  Perhaps that is what I am actually struggling with.  I previously had it super short and am trying to grow it out first but really that's probably just a delay tactic if I'm honest.
That's fair! It took me a long time to buy my first pair of masculine pants (I should have done it years earlier, not having to carry a purse is amazing) Honestly, the hardest step is the first step. What about trying it out on a weekend day where you don't have to go anywhere just to see if you like it? 
Clip on earrings are also a good no-commitment trial item, though a bit less widely available than temporary hair spray.
Lol I actually already have my ears pierced because I did not consider that to be feminine ü§£ 

Gonna have to wait a few more months before I can change earrings though.
In that case, earrings away! :D  I'm glad to see earrings being considered more neutral than they historically have been.
It only took me 9-ish(?) years from the first time I thought about possibly wanting them to the time I finally got them done.  But you're right, the first step is the easiest as it does seem like the flood gates have been opened for other piercings at least.  I tried to get an industrial last weekend but sadly I do not have the right ear structure for it üò•"	yv774p	NonBinary	5	0.79	2022-11-14 17:58:02
AMAB, prefer a female body, but nonbinary?	"(Warning: Lost post)

I've been on HRT for over 2.5 years, living full-time as a woman for 1.5 years. I don't regret starting hormones for a second, my mental state is infinity better and I much prefer all the features I've gotten to how it was before I started transitioning, and if anything I still want more. I've come to the realizing that while I don't necessarily regret transitioning, I regret how I transitioned.

I've always noticed there was this weird disconnect between myself and transgender people, especially transgender women. I always dismissed this as internalized transphobia, and then simply the fact I don't have a lot of common with the majority of transgender women (I meet zero in-group stereotypes.) Eventually, it grew to the point where I stopped calling myself transgender again. While I do think there is a bit of internalized transphobia and cringe, like what Contrapoints talks about in her most recent video, I can't help if I wonder if my therapist and I were onto something several years ago...

I almost transitioned when I was 23, but even though I technically meet the criteria for gender dysphoria, I was so comfortable, confident, and authentic living as a guy that even my gender therapist doubted if I was really trans or maybe was nonbinary. What I mean by that is that I was much less gender nonconforming as a guy than I am now, and was 100% perfectly okay with that. I think there was really was at least some of my masculinity which was authentic. It was less ""I'm not my real or authentic self, but I'm not my whole or complete self."" To this day, I feel the same about who I am now versus before.

For about two years there, I called myself that though I no desire to ever come out because I didn't see the point since I wasn't going to transition. Honestly, I was fairly content with that I identity, I didn't know if I was bigender (what my first therapist said) or gender fluid (my dysphoria came in waves I learned and gender fluid actually fluctuate and I never once felt dysphoric from femininity or being female. Plus, my identity has always felt stable and it was the dysphoria that got worse or better). I called myself a ""guy with gender dysphoria"" and was quite okay with that term.

Then there's also about that time from about 4/5 months into transitioning until about a year into it when I started going full time. I didn't necessarily feel more myself during this time, but I didn't really care if I got misgendered. I told myself ""Well, I'm rather androgynous right now and can't really blame."" Well, over time I started to care because I was sort of, indirectly told, to start caring because it's not okay to misgender trans people. Ultimately, this really only got worse after I started going full time because I was intentionally presenting as a woman instead of what I told myself before of ""presenting as myself and I'm gendered, however."" August 2018 comes around and it's time to start school again (I'm a teacher) and I wasn't ready to come out at school and was so worried it was going to be awful to wear my men's work clothes and be called Mr and all this other stuff. But it wasn't. If anything, it was awkward until I at least came out to my colleagues. My principal offered me to also transition at work, but I wasn't ready and didn't want to add that onto my students' already tumultuous start to their 9th-grade year. I spent most of that first semester part-time, and slowly went full time at work, coming out to my students that November.

Honestly, full time has been stressful. I'm constantly worried about how well I pass, suddenly hate being gendered male, and something doesn't feel right thinking of myself as a transgender woman. I feel more like I'm putting myself into a box than I was before I started transition. I've been exploring the idea of maybe taking on a more gender neutral, but maybe femme-leaning name like Kendall or Morgan. Ultimately, I don't really want to be seen as anything in the middle, but either/or. I don't like being referred to as ""they/them"" unless it's I'm in a mixed group, but I don't want he/him to bother me anymore."		gl1blt	NonBinary	5	0.86	2020-05-16 20:03:02
I Feel Hopelessly Confused	" I feel so confused of whether I should even be on HRT. I've been on it for nearly 1 year now, I've never seen a gender therapist. I identify as non-binary but I'm scared maybe it's just all a cope for body dysmorphia. If I could go on HRT without consequences or ""push the button"", I 100% would and I do like the changes HRT has brought, but HRT does seem to have so many consequences: my family don't accept me, I don't pass and never will, I have gynecomastia, reduced fertility, etc. I'm also worried about some other potential health effects that have been troubling me and it just makes me think ""is it even worth it?"". I'm not even trying to pass as a girl, I'm nb, so why do I care so much that I don't pass? I wish I was very androgynous, I wish I could pass as a girl if I choose to, but sometimes I also find myself wanting to be masculine. Maybe I just want to be different? Maybe if I start expressing myself more and exploring fashion I will feel more at peace. Maybe I should just let go of this hopeless goal and accept that I can't look like that, masculinise on T and grieve for my youthful androgynous self and then move on and be a contently masculinised Bowie fag. But then, maybe I will be in Hell again like I was before HRT when I obsessed over what T was doing to my body, and maybe I will end up looking like my Dad and wanting to die / transition at like 50. I just feel so hopelessly confused and my obsession over health effects is driving me insane. Am I even nonbinary? Should nonbinary people even be on HRT? Or is it all just a cope for BDD? I don't even know anymore"	"Non binary people are definitely alloud to be on hrt
It sounds like this is all being really hard for you. You're going through a lot and have a lot to figure out. I'm so sorry that your family doesn't accept you.

People go on HRT for different reasons, and nobody can tell you whether HRT is right for you. It sounds like there is a lot that you're figuring out about your gender and your body. You mention that you haven't seen a gender therapist. Is it possible for you to talk to a counsellor? You may find that helpful.

One of the questions you asked is whether you are even non-binary. The things you wrote about wanting to be androgynous but also masculine, but also wanting to be able to pass as a girl if you choose, it definitely sounds like you're not cis-gender. There are all sorts of words to describe different ways to feel about your gender; non-binary is just one of them. It's ok if you feel another word describes your gender; like maybe genderqueer, genderfluid, agender, pangender, demigirl, demiboy...

I hope that you find some answers to all these questions you're got."	qrjltn	NonBinary	6	1.0	2021-11-11 11:51:05
"Is it possible to accidentally ""overtransition"" or something? Can I please get some advice?"	"Going through a bit of a gender crisis to be honest. I transitioned without any particular label in mind almost 2 years ago. I just knew the ""direction"" I wanted to go - more fem, less masc. It wasn't until this month that I decided even to choose nonbinary as a box, basically because binary felt too restrictive. I've been on HRT for about 18 months now.

It feels like things have changed lately. Early on I had struggled so hard to assert my fem side, and got so caught up in it...essentially neglecting what good I did have, what parts of my body I did like, exclusively focused on the bad, or the things I didn't have. But what's strange is, **some of these things I suddenly don't care anymore about**. I'm okay that I have no thighs (I cared before). I'm okay that my chest is small (I *really* cared before)....I'm just happy to have something, and I think I would be happiest with something *just barely* bigger so it's obvious it's there but isn't a dominant feature. Even my voice. I realize I want it to be androgynous, it doesn't really need to be fem. **I thought all along I was running towards femaleness, but I was actually just rebelling against maleness.** I long for some of the barely fem unisex looks that I did early on in my transition, rather than the extremes I was trying to pull off. I don't need or want layers of makeup, but it's fun sometimes. 

I don't even know what I am anymore. My goals have changed entirely. My Adam's Apple is less prominent from my skin changes on HRT, and I'm not even sure if I need that to be removed (and like, I was dysphoric about it consistently for about 15 years) Have I evolved? Woken up? I need some help on this. **Was I stuck chasing passability rather than euphoria and rather than fighting dysphoria?** It makes me wonder if I missed the mark, or if I'm actually making enough progress that dysphoria is just leaving me. Was I this way all along and didn't realize it? I still have serious body hair and facial hair dysphoria, but like those really identify male, and it feels easier to be indistinguishable gender-wise without it. What's going on? Did I overtransition? Am I more neutral than I thought? Was I just not accepting myself fully (I do suffer from an insufficiency complex)?"	"I mean it depends on what you want. You could always lower your dose. I'm not super familiar with going masc to fem and all it entails but I get where you're coming from. I want cis people to look at me and go  ???? It's super possible that you were just trying to escape the gender box you'd been shoved in. People change constantly and that's okay! All you can really do is think about what you want, regardless of what anyone else thinks
I think it depends on the cause of why you feel/think a certain way. Take me for example, hrt for a few years, surgery of sorts, etc., but. I never bothered to identify why I bothered initially, or why I started to accept nonbinary as an option. Even now I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm on hrt. But I know I definitely don‚Äôt want to stop. There‚Äôs almost a mental block stopping me from thinking about it.
>You could always lower your dose.

I'm already too low on E so I asked if I could skip the E and go ""eunuch only"" (no hormones) basically and was told I couldn't for my bone health. But I can't replace E with T because that would be the worst outcome since it would re-masc me instead of neutral me. I think I'm as close hormonally as I can get, and my only HRT complaint right now is with sexual function.

>I want cis people to look at me and go  ????

I think the key for me is passing as both rather than neither, if that makes sense? Although I still have a slight lean more to the fem side (possibly to compensate for my natural masc features).

>It's super possible that you were just trying to escape the gender box you'd been shoved in.

This sounds plausible.
>I think it depends on the cause of why you feel/think a certain way.

This I will never know. I am not someone who's capable of being in tune with their feelings and motivations, and it took me forever just to come to a conclusion about the enby label. So what do I do about that?

>Even now I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm on hrt.

This I know. Body/Facial hair dysphoria and hair loss, along with some euphoria created by by changes in muscle mass, and a ""puffier"" change in skin shape (not sure what that's called)...I'm on the fence about the rest of stuff though really, and I waiver a lot from deep levels of dysphoria/euphoria to complete indifference.

So bottom line, if I'm incapable of understanding myself like this, as I've always been....and my euphoria/dysphoria levels are quite varied, what do I do?"	t3723s	NonBinary	4	0.84	2022-02-28 04:40:24
Could dissociation/depersonalization be due to dysphoria?	"Hello y'all.

So, a brief introduction: I've always beenpretty femenine (MTF), and always really androginous (when I was a kid), always getting ""are you a boy or a girl?"" and loving it. But puberty hit me hard and since then my life has been a nightmare. I've started to be really depressed and abusing drugs and alcohol (started at 13) and soon enough I was having full on dissociation and depersonalization crisis. It was the worst, once in a while I would wake up middle of the night WET in sweat, my bed wet and with a distorted perception of reality with an unmensurable pain and willing to just idk disappear or die. I did not have any access to trans people or theory, and never thought about it, but I hated my self image and would probably get really bad even looking myself in the mirror. At some point (late 2013), I had almost a psychotic crisis and ended up cutting myself, my hair, my beard, my eyebrows and dying what was left of my hair white. It was such an epic and epiphany moment that I mostly just laughed about it and really enjoyed the figure I had built. Everyone hated how I looked and for the first time in my life I didn't care AT ALL about what others would think and deep down I was so amazed to be in control of what others would think of me and to know that if someone hated my image it was because I wanted them to... From that point on, I began being the freakest I could, and would always have exquizite hair cuts and dye random colors, wear creepy make up and freaky clothing (wearing things that wasnt supposed to be clothing as well). From that point on, I didn't had anymore image crisis, and everytime it seemed I was going to, I would mess up my own image until I was able to identify with it again. From that point on, I started enjoying more being myself and to understand more who I was and things of that nature. Throughout that proccess I had access to queer theory and trans people, but always thought it wasnt for me because I didn't felt like a girl since early ages (or ever for that matter), and recently I began to understand that is not about that, and that I always would want to be one in a way or another, and figured out that I am a trans person (started hrt 2 months ago). The thing is: in the past years I've been more and more chill with my image, I know how it works for me to atenuate the things that bothers me the most (beard still the one thing that can led me to rock bottom but ill laser it as soon as pandemic is over), and I've been living with all this pretty much under control and anxious to have hrt results. But then, yesterday I went to the mirror to put a scarf and suddently I melted down into a depersonalization crisis that I didn't have in a LONG TIME and saw myself in a really horrendous way and started crying. I went to sleep and had really bad nightmares and woke up with pain all over my body, a sense of despair and willing to die. I put on a mask and am wearing it all day so I don't accidentaly see the reflection of my face, but even seeing my arms are setting me off. I took a clonazepan that I have for moments of crisis, meditated, did some healing tea, and I still am in crises and desperated. Could it all be someway due to dysphoria? Like, it was ever related to my self image, and when I began a genderless weird exquizite figure it all went away, and now that I decided to transition and am with a way more ""normal"" look (and pretty masculine) I went down on my old crisis again that did not happen for more than 6 years (actually I did have depersonalization crisis back in 2018 when I acted in a movie where I was supposed to be a straight cis guy and had to let my beard and eyebrows grow again after 4 years... I had lots of crisis and could bale off because I needed the money, but then I was full bearded and eyebrows and natural hair. now i am no beard, no eyebrows and dyed hair and even though I have this random crisis that are tearing me appart)

Anyway, I think that was more like taking something off my chest than a question, but anyways, thank you for your time."	"depersonalization and derealization are the primary components of my gender dysphoria
I feel so dumb for not realizing it before... I was so suicidal and depressive, and had all in my hands to figure it out (queer/trans friends, queer theory etc) and if i had started transitioning 6 years ago it would be so much better. Im glad i realised it now, but idk what to do regarding my ongoing crisis. The mask is helping in a way
i try to attack my dysphoria as internalized transphobia.  if i work on it that way, i actually have an angle to attack it from.  it's far from perfect, but it helps to tell the nasty dysphoria voice in my head: ""shut up, TERF"""	hzllap	NonBinary	5	0.86	2020-07-28 19:49:51
cis agender amab advice	"Ok so idk exactly know what to call myself but kinda do, outside everyone sees big hairy man and I don't care about my pronouns so he/him works. On the inside I have no internal since gender beyond the best way to describe as goblin ( so I'm technically a bugbare) 

And I honestly have no way to let people know without sounding incredibly stupid, because I'm not trans for the fact I have no transition and I've just always been like this, and well idk what to do because I feel weird in NB spaces because I don't have a similar experiences or the stuff that hardens us as people because I simply pass incredibly well because I embrace my secondary sex characteristics  but like I'm still agender and don't understand what all the fuss is  about roles and the rules of one can do and one can't based on their gender cause I don't have that. Sooooo ahhhhhhhhhhhh neurodivergent screaming"	"Trans doesn't equal transition it just means you don't identify with your agab (though you decide the labels put on you ofc).

And your identity is valid no matter how you choose to express yourself, you don't have to be androgynous. I get your struggle though, I also dress mostly according to my sex and felt like an impostor many times because of that. But it doesn't matter how other people see you (aka thinking you're simply your agab) what matters is how you feel about yourself. It helped me a lot to play around with gender expression and clothing and learn what I actually am comfortable in and also that I can look at myself in a dress and see a boy in a dress which is just ... euphoria :>

Also I've seen quite the overlap of people being nd and non binary/trans! Maybe their (not sure if I'm also neurodivergent) understanding of societal constructs such as gender is just surperior and lifts the burden of gender roles from (some of) them idk :D
i feel that, i feel no gender, just moth. (nocturnal, fluffy, cute, annoying and goth. also bites)

i also am mostly fine with being identified with ""girl"" as an afab, because on the gender spectrum i probably fit somewhere between completely neutral and girl. honestly, i've only recently started really identifying as NB, and I'm not out to most people yet, and for a long time it was a thing i had on the backburner, like fine, i'll be girl, i'll deal with why that doesn't feel comfortable later. it's only started getting really intense after i started dating someone else who doesn't identify with their agab, and neither of us knows what these so-called men and women are, so you are not alone.

you don't have to call yourself trans if you don't want to. i don't, because of how it correlates with medical transition now. it's totally up to you
I feel u and relate. I am an amab transfemme enby dating an amab not transitioning enby and we are pretty explicitly not welcome most places
Eh it might just be internalized transphobia or the fact I'm very comfortable in my sex and physical body so I don't relate with the trans lable because I don't share the same experiences. 

But yes boy in a dress great shit, throw a cloak over it as well pure bliss. Fine I'm a man am an adult and I want a fucking dress that looks good on my boxy frame, not to mention the idea of making it armored
Leave it up to agenders to describe their gender as the weirdest things , you moth , I goblin but it just fits
Yeah and like we get it , homophobes they don't like us that's fine we're used to it , but when you get into queer spaces and they don't expect you for xyz that's what really hurts and makes you feel out casted because it's not expected 


Ugh idk, finding a place is difficult I'm just glad I'm fine being on my own
i initally read ""you moth"" as an insult and both felt panic and euphoria haha i shall continue to moth, you shall continue to goblin, we shall break down the gender binary \^\^
No I not moth , I goblin , but yes break smash
sorry, adhd made me space out. edited to make sense. break, smash"	qaex5a	NonBinary	5	0.73	2021-10-18 04:03:15
So good and bad things. On the plus side I came out to a family friend. Downside her husband was talking down Trans peps to my fam.	"So I was talking to her and my partner and his other partner (poly fam) we‚Äôre talking to him. I hear him start talking about the use of Them being plural, and I knew that was bs before I knew non-binary was an option. I used it in papers when a theoretical person‚Äôs gender was not disclosed. Ignorant point score at 1.

Next up talking about suicide rates being the same pre and post transition. Ya because people are assholes. But for many it improves their quality of life, help slow down and stop eating disorders, so on. It makes people happy. Ignorant point score 2.

Next up he started on about how condoning a war against themselves is unhealthy. Ok....? And that it just opens up a battle with society. Haha. Challenging societal norms is good for society. It‚Äôs not like the LGBTQ community doesn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs gonna be difficult coming out. 3

Last part he went on about appropriate therapy, in place of transitioning. Me just fast blinking. You gonna say the same to women who want breast reductions so the don‚Äôt get looked at all the time, so they will fit in the clothes and bras they like? People who want nose jobs? Face lifts? So on? No you don‚Äôt care about those. Also all the people I have seen transitioning need therapists referrals or primary care for long standing issues. 4

All of this ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a problem with trans people.‚Äù




So I didn‚Äôt actually respond to him. I‚Äôm in shock, because he‚Äôs actually an intelligent person. I‚Äôve had a decent amount of respect for him before this. I look at his wife.

‚ÄúOh is he talking about the gender thing? Ya he had a problem with an ex friend who took things a bit too far.‚Äù Definite undertone of not agreeing with his point of view.

So.. I told her I have OSDD due to some trauma and actually identify as non-binary since not all of my alters are my bio gender. ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs fair.‚Äù She smiles and we continue playing with our kids. No big deal. Yay I came out to someone. 

I‚Äôve previously come out to therapist, best friend and partner. First semi close friend, and it went well."	"i would've actually challenged him on it but that's just me personally

i'm the enby who ignorant bigots tend to respect tho as i know what makes them tick and i know how to take exception while minimizing alarms and doing so in such a way that they actually listen (i've annoyed a few liberal allies and enbies on twitter because of the word choice required) and yes it's a difficult thing to learn especially if you weren't raised in a socially conservative background like i mostly was (immediate family less conservative than extended) and you also have to be hard to offend
I‚Äôm borderline wallflower unfortunately
understandable

i'm an ambivert leaning introvert so it's a bit easier tho i also feel an actual need to correct so that kinda pushes me a little further in that direction too
Trying to learn to be a bit more.. strong? For kiddos sake. Little bean is gonna need me to be strong support some day, so I‚Äôve gotta be. It‚Äôs easier when it‚Äôs not someone you know..
yeah makes sense

in my case i kinda had emotional strength forced into me at a young age first gnc as a toddler + bigoted babysitters then an overtly ableist and abusive kindergarten teacher with abusive and enabling principal then an ableist and abusively neglectful second grade teacher then 3-4 constant gnc-related and ableist harassment and low-grade bullying that in 5th grade escalated to death threats then in 6th a hyperwoke yet ableist af teacher going on a tirade against me and then trying to get me expelled for retaliating and scaring her shitless

and that's highly abridged with a family that largely didn't see anything wrong

basically i was left with two options fight or surrender and i decided change is only going to happen if i fight it

(oh and my experience with that helped me get a highly ableist science teacher who was constantly disparaging a classmate because of his motor disability necessitating the use of a typewriter to stop and actually accept it among other things)

I identify as a person that exists	"So like, bear with me here because I'm kind of just figuring it all out myself. I'm 28 and transitioned from male to female originally.

Basically half a year ago I ""officially"" came out as NB although nothing really changed because I still use female pronouns and it's not like I'm going to force someone to use they/them for me; it's just preferable over he/him etc. It all just really felt like the most accurate way to describe how I see my gender, especially after legally/medically transitioning(SRS etc). Like dysphoria gone now I don't really have the obligation to keep trying to prove to myself/others that I'm a woman. My sex marker on my legal documents says F and physically that matches and past that I don't really care. So to kind of keep things sane in my life I just go with the female label because that's what fits and it's better than being called a man. 

I remember when I was first starting HRT that was literally the goal and it's something that I've thought about a lot. For a long time my gender identity hasn't even really been ""female"" it's just been ""not male"" and I always felt really outcast from other trans women bc of it. Like, I didn't even really feel I needed SRS, I just needed removal of a certain part and that my ideal genitals were just blank. That thought just gets me lately I suppose.

Like, growing up I remembered seeing the word ""androgyny"" on TV and it was mostly applied to people who went to raves, or goth girls and I didn't ever really understand it. But it's kind of the word that feels most at home to me lately and I almost wonder if that's specifically because I'm kind of older and ""non binary"" feels like a bit of a buzz word at times? I'd be afraid of the backlash if I told my coworkers I was NB but not so much if I just said I was androgynous. 

I think a lot of what I'm trying to get at here is that I'm really just confused. Part of me thinks that this ""non-binary"" thing is just my gender ""presentation"" and that deep down I am actually a woman although granted an androgynous one, especially since having a female sex is what's comfortable to me. Then there's the fact that I know that in a perfect world I'd be completely sexless and like the title says, just a person that exists.

Has anyone else here gone through something similar? Especially AFAB people if I'm being honest because I feel like that's mostly who I'd relate to. How do you bring it up to potential partners or address it in other aspects of your life? I feel really awkward especially given the whole ""I came out and nothing changed"" thing like?"	Hey!

Questioning my identity. Some advices, please?	"Hi!

It started four or five years ago. I found out what terms like transgender means and wanted to transition right away... but five months later I stopped with that, decided that it was probably mistake and tried to live my life like before (I was really scared and did not want attention, I found someone who liked me and tried to forget about it).

It was normal ... kind of but here I am thinking about that same thing again. Sometimes I do not really care or think about things like that and sometimes it is stuck in my mind. I imagine to be a male, I guess I have a dysphoria and sometimes it gets really strong and uncomfortable. I am not manly or girly .. I may be something in the middle when it comes to behaviour. I was thinking that I would like to be born as a male .. but I am really scared about transition and stuff like that. I would like to have male features .. I really hate my chest, hips .. I would like my voice to be deeper. One thing that I do not like about that is to be hairy .. but I am not really sure what this is. Is it just a phase? What should I do? And I do not comunicate with people often so I cannot say if there is social dysphoria ..

I wish I had some practical advice for you üò≠. All I can say is that I feel you. I'm genderfluid and my dysphoria changes day to day.

I don't think I'll ever physically transition, but I've been doing small things to help me present more masc/andro and it's been so wonderful

I just found you can do voice therapy to help your voice sound a bit deeper. Ive only been practicing a little but it helps me feel a bit more confident

I've been presenting more masc lately too and it's helped a lot 

I've also lost weight and feel like that's helped balance my hormones out tremendously. Also shrunk my (huge) boobs a bit, and the euphoria about this is the real deal

Even just coming out and talking about it more has helped so much.  

I still get dysphoria top and bottom but it's more of a physical discomfort than full blown self loathing, and easier to deal with now that I can be myself
It's crazy that people always say transpeople want attention, when we usually don't. One piece of advice I'll give you is that it doesn't matter how ""manly"" or ""girly"" you are, there are plenty of ""girly"" guys and ""manly"" girls. That's got nothing to do woth your gender. Just keep talking to others who have simular struggles, you'll learn who you are soon enough.
Thank you for reply!
I have not heard about voice therapy .. it sounds very iteresting and worth trying. I am thinking about telling my partner but I am worried .. I said that I do not consider myself as a female but I said that I do not want to transition .. now I am not sure about that. 
I am scared about his reaction to it too.
Thank you for response! .. I am scared of what may other people think, my family is not very understanding when comes to topic like this and I do not know anyone who has simular struggles in person, that is mostly why I appear here. But to hear opinions and advice is really helpful. Thanks."	bcsibt	NonBinary	4	0.84	2019-04-13 16:51:41
I am very conflicted on whether I'm a Trans Woman or Nonbinary, Help Appreciated.	"Hello everyone, I have recently had a very eye opening experience about my identity and it has made me consider if I‚Äôm Nonbinary for the first time. I recently came to the realization that I‚Äôm Aroace (Asexual & Aromantic) and this has really opened my eyes on ideas that I had kinda mentally blocked before. I used to be somewhat aphobic due to some of the people in my life and after realizing I was Aroace myself it made me kinda realize I have been doing the same thing with Nonbinary as well. I have internalized some negative ideas about it, but now I‚Äôm really unsure where I stand on my gender.

I am AMAB and have been trans for over a decade now, or at least I suspected, it‚Äôs been a tough road on accepting it. Due partly to my asexuality I began to be very aroused by the idea of transitioning when I hit puberty, it‚Äôs pretty much the only thing that ever did anything for me in that regard. It gave me a lot of imposter syndrome for a long time. I have always disliked how my body looked and wished it was more female in appearance. I have been on HRT for a year now and the arousal thing has gone away and I have enjoyed many of the changes it has brought. 

But there are some things about how I feel that now looking at it are some pretty big signs I may be Nonbinary. I don‚Äôt care about pronouns at all, being called he/him doesn‚Äôt phase me in the slightest. I have a very male sounding name and yet I have never been bothered by it, I like it and don‚Äôt feel inclined to change it. Wearing women‚Äôs clothes has never felt special and I pretty much never do it, though my fashion sense is very basic, I just wear blank t-shirts and simple pants. I have never been interested in bottom surgery, I have no dysphoria with that aspect of myself, though this may be tied to my being Asexual, don‚Äôt know. Largest of all I have never been comfortable thinking of myself as a woman, applying that term to myself has never felt right. I am more okay with thinking about myself as a man at least somewhat, but as I said before I have a lot of dysphoria about my body being male looking. I have always been down for changing my body to more reflect how I felt about it, but I have never cared about people externally validating that. In fact I have had a lot of anxiety telling people that I‚Äôm trans partly because I didn‚Äôt want them to change anything in how they acted. 

After realizing I was Aroace it‚Äôs been amazing feeling confident about my sexuality and what it is, it really did just click with me. I have accepted I am trans for a few years now but I‚Äôve never had that feeling about my gender, I feel about it like I felt about my sexuality before my current understanding, constantly conflicted. I‚Äôve always been kinda embarrassed about being trans, I‚Äôve always assumed it‚Äôs been internalized transphobia but I‚Äôm starting to think it‚Äôs possible it‚Äôs because I never fully identified with it. After knowing I was Aroace I came out to my friends two days later, I was just ecstatic about it, I‚Äôve never felt that way about being trans. 

For most of my life I have thought of Nonbinary as not being real, I am still working on that internalized prejudice. It‚Äôs similar to how I felt about being Asexual and dealing with that made me accept that as who I am. I need advice on Nonbinary, do my experiences indicate that I may be in some regard? For along time I thought some of the things I‚Äôve felt weren‚Äôt valid and I was just confused. I know I will have to come to the conclusion myself at some point but right now I‚Äôm really lost. I would also really appreciate hearing what it feels like to be Nonbinary, I know that‚Äôs a personal question that will be unique to every individual but that‚Äôs what got me over the edge on my sexuality since those Aroace perspectives really resonated with me. Any help or advice would be much appreciated. Thank you all for reading, I appreciate it."	">Any help or advice would be much appreciated. 

My two cents is to focus on actions rather than labels.

You sound like you're already pretty clear about what you want (hormonal feminization), what you don't want (bottom surgery) & what doesn't particularly bother you (pronoun, birth name, clothing).  If I'm interpreting that correctly, then good for you - that's 90% of it. 

Just live your life, transition in all the ways that you feel would benefit you, and only in those ways (transitioning is a pick & mix, not a package deal). An identity label (""man"" vs ""nonbinary person"" vs ""woman"") is just a loose description; ultimately, 7 billion people have 7 billion slightly different experiences of gender. Over time, you'll probably gravitate towards a way of describing yourself that's convenient & feels natural.

>I would also really appreciate hearing what it feels like to be Nonbinary,

I'm not sure how useful this will be, given how much nonbinary people differ from each other, but here is my (38 NB MtF) experience:

* I have pretty standard body dysphoria & am doing a MtF physical transition (E, blocker, laser, electro &, once I save up the money, orchi & FFS - in the distant future maybe I'll think about nulloplasty if orchi doesn't do the trick)
* I have virtually zero social dysphoria. If anything, the more I transition physically & feel comfy in my body, the I actually feel gender euphoria from a soft-masc presentation & social role. I like having male friends who call me ""bro"", ""man"" etc. & I put effort into passing as cis-male. I even like my sports bras to look as manly as possible (black/grey coloured, unpadded etc.)
* I have some ickiness at being classed as a man, but not that much; I also have no strong pronoun preferences (he/him & they/them are both fine). I have zero attachment to the idea of being a woman. Female, sure, - I want to change my body from a male set of characteristics to a female set of characteristics - but not a woman. It doesn't feel icky like the idea of manhood, but it definitely feels off. 
* Basically I'm just me - I have certain preferences (female body, masc presentation) & I'm pursuing those preferences. Labels are mostly just a way of explaining myself to other people.
Here's a fun little exercise I've been trying with people recently to explore this! 

Tomorrow morning, every last human being wakes up as sentient green jello. All the same size, all the same shade of green. Nobody has pineapple chunks. Just green jello. We all reproduce asexually. 

**Do you want to be seen as, referred to, treated like, talked about, as a woman? As a sentient blob of green jello, do you find comfort, respect, fulfillment, from being addressed by she/her pronouns and still seen as feminine?**

I've asked cis people who said yes without hesitation, and other cis people who had to really stop and think but said yes regardless. As an enby myself, everybody in the world waking up as green jello would feel immensely liberating for me, which is pretty telling of my view on gender. I've asked other queer friends of mine who tended to struggle with it more and eventually said no, they wouldn't want to be seen as their AGAB.
Have you considered that maybe you‚Äôre a Demi girl? 
if you don‚Äôt know what that is (I didn‚Äôt until very recently) it‚Äôs basically where you‚Äôre a mix of both girl and non-binary Basically you switch between the two depending on the day you might feel more like a girl whereas maybe a few days later you don‚Äôt anymore
Honestly from the information you gave, There's not enough for me to say whether you could be NB, Although of course only you can say whether you are in the first place. You don't need to have dysphoria in every aspect to be a trans girl, There are binary trans people without bottom dysphoria, Or without name dysphoria, Et Cetera, The biggest thing however is you not feeling comfortable with referring to yourself as a woman, There may be some exceptions but I imagine most Trans Women would not only be comfortable with that, But more comfortable than most any alternative.

As for my personal experience, I've wished I was intersex for basically as long as I've known it was a thing, Partially because I kinda felt in my mind that intersex people were ""Superior"" in some way. I also for a good while didn't really care about gender, I distinctly recall once thinking that I wanted to tell a girl I liked that I love her, And if she said she was a lesbian I'd have no problem transitioning into a woman to be with her (Which in hindsight is a pretty creepy and Not Good thought process.). Afterwards I started thinking a bit more, Considering that maybe I wasn't cis, I didn't really have any problems with being male, I just wanted to be female as well in some ways (That's not to say I don't have dysphoria, I don't really feel dysphoric about having a male body, But I do about *not* having a female body, If that makes sense?), At first I thought maybe I was a Demi-Boy, Although that didn't feel quite right. Due to these feelings, For quite a while I was questioning, Unsure if I was a cis femboy, Or non-binary, Or a trans tomboy. Eventually I settled on the fact that I'm *probably* Bigender, Meaning I'm both a lad and a lass ~~which is clearly superior to being just one~~, Although I'm still not 100% certain, Mainly as I haven't had much opportunity to experiment. I don't much care if people perceive or refer to me as male (Although I do feel a bit sad when I'm seen as ""Not A Woman"", For example), But when people refer to or see me as female or non-binary, Including using She/Her or They/Them pronouns, I do get a sprout of happiness (I imagine this is the fabled ""Gender Euphoria"" of which I've heard tell).
I identify as aroace and nonbinary. The fun with identifying under nonbinary is, I don't have to know exactly how i feel gender-wise day to day because it's a fluid gender identity, meaning it is up to me. I describe myself as trans-masc under it because even though I am aroace, I still want a partner one day, and I feel more open to showing love and accepting love when I see myself with a more masculine presentation. It's a weird sense of  dysphoria that causes me to disconnect from myself. Gender is weird, I don't really see myself as any gender when alone, but when needing it for social things, I like being a soft-masculine person. When I can perceive myself as gender-neutral in this way, I can ""see"" myself better. I feel less disconnected. And then i can more comfortably connect with people in my surroundings in my own platonic way.
Thank you for your words! Alot what what you said made alot of sense to me especially your personal experiences. For a long time I kinda viewed transition as a package deal which I now know is wrong but I felt pressured to fit the norm. I felt the exact same way with relationships before I realized I was Aroace, that I needed to act and think like other people to fit the mold. I know that's weird to say as someone who is Trans in some regard but that was my mindset. 

Like before a week ago I was planning on changing my name because I thought I had to, but I now realize I was going to do that to fit other people's expectations, not because that's what I wanted. I know lables aren't the end all be all, I'm just trying to find and use them to help guide my internal thought process. Thank you for reading my story and sharing yours, I really appreciate it.
This was a very interesting question, I had to give it alot of thought. I think my eventual answer is no I would not want to to be seen and addressed as a woman, or a man. I would love to be able to not care about what other people think Ed about gender and just be happy with myself. I think I've spent my life both when I was Cis and Trans trying to fit other people's expectations instead of just pursing what made me happy. If everyone was the same and I could feel comfortable as that it would feel pretty good, not thinking about gender would be really nice. Thank you for your advice, I think your question was very helpful.
I'm Not Sure How I'd Feel In That Scenario But I Think I Probably Wouldn't Want To Be Seen As Green Jello, Lol."	yqog1o	NonBinary	4	0.84	2022-11-09 16:52:15
Just venting	" You don‚Äôt really have to read this, I just needed to get it out of my system because there is absolutely no one I am comfortable enough to talk to about my gender (not even my therapist lol). It‚Äôs going to be a long text so I am sorry. 
 I (18F) have been struggling with my gender identity for almost a year, which I think is weird because I started caring about it after 17 years of my life.There are a few signs in my past that could mean I am trans but I worry I am faking it all or it‚Äôs just a phase idk, but it doesn‚Äôt really matter rn. The thing is, I HATE being seen as a girl, mostly if I talk to a cis guy, which is probably why I could never date anyone, it was really annoying. So I must not be a girl right? Wrong, if I look at old pictures of me (when I had longer hair which makes me feel like a girl even tho I know it has nothing to do with gender) ‚Äúbeing a girl‚Äù I like that person and I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem being them. BUT if I imagine myself as a boy or even play as a boy in a videogame I feel great. Also, I noticed that almost every guy I have ever thought I had a crush on was in fact not a ‚ÄúI wanna be with you‚Äù but a ‚ÄúI wanna be you‚Äù. I really really really wish I was born a man, but at the same time it wouldn‚Äôt be the end of the world to be a girl, sometimes I am very okay with that. 
 ‚ÄúSo you are genderfluid right?‚Äù Probably. I can‚Äôt tell if I fell anything else, I think it‚Äôs mostly being demiboy and demigirl (sometimes at the same time) but that is where my problem is, because how could I ever be both? I am too scared to tell my parents if I were to go through a transition, but if I could, I would love to have my voice deeper - although my face doesn‚Äôt fit a guy - have a more masculine name, be called he/him and have short hair. I would also like to have my long hair back and have bigger breasts. But it‚Äôs impossible to have both. I could keep my hair short and wear a wig or idk but what about everything else? 
  Being seen by society as a boy makes me happier than as a girl or even non binary, but that feeling sometimes goes away and I feel like I never had any gender disphoria. 
  To sum up, I like being a boy and a girl, but being a boy is way harder, but I also don‚Äôt feel complete as a girl, which I do as a boy (but maybe wouldn‚Äôt in a long term). 
  This came out very confusing, I am sorry. And even if I could be a trans boy I would be terrified of the men‚Äôs bathroom lol. 
  Anyways, being a girl is easier, even though I feel really bad about not being able to be a boy. Should I live the rest of my life pretending I don‚Äôt have gender disphoria? Should I say I am non binary but female presenting to soothe things a little? Can I change my fucking name because I hate it (not even gender related I just really hate it)? Yes? No? Idk. 
  (I must have forgotten something but it‚Äôs already long enough. If you read it till here I love you. And sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language.)"		mt2tk3	NonBinary	4	0.84	2021-04-18 00:45:09
Implants for AFAB non binary person?	"Hi friends! So I've been weighing my options for gender affirming surgery/hrt. I've been talking with my therapist about maybe taking T for a bit for some of the changes. I also have through most of my life really wanted a larger bust size. It's something I think about and talk about often. And if I go on T, I will likely lose breast mass, which would honestly be devastating. 

I would consider this a gender affirming surgery, but because I'm AFAB, I worry that insurance might not. Both my therapist and primary care doctor are more than happy to vouch for me that it would be an important piece of my transition.

Has anyone had any experience with this? Any advice?"		12604rf	NonBinary	4	1.0	2023-03-29 20:43:53
Waffling on Hormones	It‚Äôs been a little over a month on estrogen (AMAB) and some days I‚Äôm ecstatic about it and other days I don‚Äôt really care. I don‚Äôt think I regret anything, but how convicted should I be in my transition?	"I went back and forth for like three years before just diving in. After 4 months (on T, not E) I'm seeing early results and its not the overwhelming joy I imagined, but there is a consistent relief. The lack of bad feelings I'm used to. My first month I seriously considered stopping, and now I might never.


Give it time.
You should talk to your doctor about it. If you are feeling kinda ambivalent about it maybe you should chill till you are certain, there is no rush.
I felt the same way for awhile; now I'm 100% convinced it was the right decision. 

Of course, do keep in mind what is and isn't reversible, but it's your decision, and having uncertainty doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong for you.

Coming out to my cishet partner -- advice?	"Hello, new here. I identify as non-binary of course, no other term really fits me (I went by demigirl for a little bit, but wasn't feeling it. I just like non-binary on its own!)  


Well, I love my boyfriend. We've been dating for 4+ years and he's always known I'm bisexual, from the time we began dating.  
Over the COVID year, I began exploring my gender for the first time since high school (I am about to graduate college) and slowly transitioned (socially) from a cis woman, to a she/they, and now to fully they/them with a new name (Celeste! It's my middle name.)  


But more to the point...my boyfriend has always loved and supported me, regardless. I don't think he would dump me or any thing for being non binary; I won't go and say he's an out and proud LGBTQ ally, but he's not -phobic in any way and just respects everyone regardless of their identity (though I have noticed he slips on a mutual friend with they/them.)  
I'm mostly concerned about one thing.  


I don't think he would want to change his identity to anything such as bi+ etc. Not that he is constantly like ""Yep I'm straight and just straight"" but honestly, I'm okay with him continuing to identify as straight; in my mind, hetero just means attracted to only genders unalike your own (though not everyone sees it this way and that's ok!) and I don't have any connection to masculinity; only some femininity and mostly neutrality.  
Is this okay for me to think? I don't want to offend anyone by being non-binary and having a het identifying partner, but I don't really care because I know he will continue to support me anyway!

TLDR: Okay with my partner IDing as straight after I come out to him. Is this ok?  
Either way, any advice or tips from someone coming out as non binary/trans to their cis/cishet partner would be really helpful..thank you :D"	"Gay and lesbian were introduced into English before our society had a clear understanding that sex and gender are not the same thing. A gay man saying ""I'm gay"" meant ""I'm attracted to penis-having people who identify masculine."" There was no ambiguity. But now, we understand that gender and sex are *not* the same thing, so these terms have ambiguity. Is that gay man saying he's attracted to bodies that have penises, or masculine identifying individuals? Both? Neither? Something else? It's up to him to explain exactly what he means by using that term.

And even if that wasn't the case, it's not like a cis straight man is attracted to every single woman on the planet and none of the men. No orientation label is going to be an exhaustive list of exactly who someone is or is not attracted to. Orientation is an approximation, a general indication of where one's attraction might lie. Just like ""East"" refers to a direction, not a specific place.

These words exist so that you can communicate a general idea of who you're into. They exist for no other purpose. So, depending on what feeling you're trying to communicate, gay or lesbian might be good terms you could use. Or maybe queer, or trixic or toric, or marsic or venusian or any of the other hundreds of orientation labels out there. You can use any word you feel will accurately convey how you feel to whomever you're speaking to.

So, you coming out as non-binary doesn't *make* him anything. He's still free to use straight or any other label he feels comfortable with. But it's up to you to decide if you're comfortable with his choices. If my partner described themselves as straight, and in a straight relationship, I would feel incredibly invalidated. But that's definitely not the case for everyone. So, it's up to him to pick his labels, just like it's up to you to pick yours. But you also get to decide how you feel about his choices, and it's up to the two of you together to decide how to describe the partnership.
I feel invalidated in relationships with people (of other genders than mine) who identify as straight, but not with those who id as hetero, as long as they see me as my gender and not my agab. I am, after all, of a different gender than them, so hetero is technically correct. I tend to have less trouble in relationships with some people who are bi, pan or demi, since it‚Äôs easier with people who already connect to person rather than gender, but  the necessary part is consistently experiencing that they relate to me as me, and not a gender that I‚Äôm not. 

In my experience even people who previously believed themselves to be straight can relate to me as my actual gender (or rather, genderlessness), as long as they‚Äôre not too invested in this ‚Äùbeing straight‚Äù-thing. My best relationships (including friendships) gender identity-wise have been when I was out from the start though, or with other trans/questioning/experimenting people, but I‚Äôm currently in an almost thirteen years long relationship with someone who (without having thought of it much, admittedly) thought they were straight until we met, so there‚Äôs that.
maybe i can help! feel free to dm me:) i‚Äôm cis and bi and my partner is nonbinary and lesbian. if i was straight, i would still like them, and if i was gay, i would still like them. because i like who they are as a person. i think that‚Äôs part of the beauty of being nonbinary, it kinda bends the ‚Äúrules‚Äù we as a society have which are arbitrary anyway. and i agree i think liking genders unlike your own can definitely be straight if that‚Äôs how a person feels. your identity doesn‚Äôt change his sexuality. and still, sexuality is fluid and there‚Äôs so many variables and it‚Äôs hard to know if people can really be 100% anything. lots of people are straight or gay and have their own exceptions, and i think that‚Äôs great. labels are awesome and they matter and help us feel connected to similar people, but they don‚Äôt define who we are. we aren‚Äôt solely deduced to our labels, so honestly? who cares. i mean that in the best way. as long as you‚Äôre happy that‚Äôs all that matters, and he should support you completely no matter what. if your gender is a dealbreaker for him he‚Äôs definitely entitled to that, but he wouldn‚Äôt be right for you anyway. as for coming out to him, just be as honest as you can. my partner didn‚Äôt really come out to me, they are very out and have been since before we were together. but we still have lots of conversations about their identity, experiences, body stuff, family, etc and i‚Äôm always so eager to listen and just know them more. i think if your boyfriend is a keeper he will feel the same way!
but also, my partner has said in a joking way, that anyone who is attracted to them is queer in some way. which if you saw them you‚Äôd understandüòÇ i think that‚Äôs great. so it‚Äôs really up to you and what your comfortable with, like someone else has said. godspeed!"	r51ieh	NonBinary	4	1.0	2021-11-29 17:58:46
Scared of seeking transition care	Due to the current moral panic sweeping the globe, I am afraid of seeking out professional help with my transition. The local gender clinic has had protests outside, threatening phone calls, and even people crashing support groups to spew bigoted conspiracy theories. I am wondering if it‚Äôs even worth it to seek medical help or if I should just transition underground without the help of specialists, or if it‚Äôs even worth it to transition at all.	"Is there maybe a clinic farther away you could go to? Whenever I go to planned parenthood I make the trip out to the boonies to avoid the city protestors.

I would still recommend going to professionals over going underground even if that‚Äôs not an option though. Maybe bring some allies if you can? Just trying to throw some ideas out - stay safe out there ‚ù§Ô∏è"	xun0zz	NonBinary	5	1.0	2022-10-03 15:47:13
What to do next?	"Hi so this is gonna be a lot of questions and I'm okay with not having all the answers. For a long time I've had a lot of feelings and emotions and spiritual disconnects with myself. It wasn't until the beginning of this year and again when I moved out that I began to accept myself for who I was more. The reason for all of the disconnect and frustration on my part imo was most likely due to my mormon upbringing. 

I grew up mormon in california which is a godsend tbh I am so glad I didn't grow up in Utah. I love southern Utah so much for the scenery but I figure that's probably where the end of that adoration lies. Growing up my parents were really toxic to another and while they were good about keeping it away from us as kids, I came to learn that I was hated in a way by my mother (she drew negative associations to me  and connected them to her life issues at the time I was born). For my entire childhood and teenage years I had a lot of expectations, ideologies, and identities placed upon me. Anytime I confessed having an issue with masturbation my parents looked at me with disgust and told me to go to bed and ""pray it away"". I was groomed to be a missionary and a good man to marry some woman in the temple one day. To go to college at some church university and just be who they wanted to be. And for a long time, I was. 

Fast forward to 2018, my junior year of high school. I rented a cabin with some of my bestest friends and now roommates. On the trip, my friend Gabe and I talked religion and ideology and suddenly my first emotional and mental frustration began. I couldn't be the apologist for the religion that my dad was anymore especially as I began seriously looking into it's founding, the people within it, and more. I couldn't believe in a God who didn't want their children to love themselves and be who they wanted to be. I began to stop going to church after that life changing trip and began working on a plan to move out with the guys in the fall of 2020. 

In between 2018 and 2020, I found out that I was bisexual (or so I thought at the time) and started to steadily understand a lot more about my heart and my mind and who I really wanted to be. While renting an Airbnb with the guys again in June of 2020, I made the decision to nair my body hair and when I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror I felt more comfortable and more myself than I ever had. When I got home I told my parents I lost a bet. 

Before my roommates (the guys) and I moved out in September, I bought some cute clothes to ""crossdress"" in and again I felt even more myself than ever before. My heart broke when I realized I couldn't leave my bathroom dressed that way, so I put back on my masc clothes and went back to my room. When I was finally moved out I felt so free and happy, and began to dress that way whenever I could üåü

Between then and now I began daily meditation and I started a path of self discovery. After meeting a nonbinary person going through transition out where the roomies and I moved to, I suddenly began to realize feelings I had buried inside of myself. Suddenly my name felt less and less my own and looking at myself in the mirror in my masculine clothes and even without them I felt off. After a lot of research, meditation, and help from friends, I finally figured that I must have been nonbinary and pansexual my whole life, but my feelings of responsibility and duty to my parents to be a ""good normal son"" (since my older sisters are both in the lgbtq+ community and also distanced from the church) had always blocked my true self from coming out. I feel so much happier and more me every day and I'm planning to see my doctor about hormone therapy in the next couple of months. Money is tight atm as it is for many, but I'm excited to keep developing and caring for Cecil, the person I always knew I was but only could remember them in dreams. I used to dream about this beautiful person over the last couple years and I thought it was who I would marry but as I dressed up for the first time I saw them in the reflection. I'm crying right now and I cried then thinking about it. 

I've come out to my close friends and my siblings who were all super loving and accepting. My parents are the last ones really who I haven't told. They have changed and grown and matured so much over the last ten years and our relationship is really good, but I'm not sure they will accept me. I hop they can honor and accept me as I have honored and accepted them for who they are and how that and their life experiences developed their ideologies, but I'm not sure it will be a two way street. My dad still refers to my enby nibbling (my sister's step kid) as their dead name and dead pronouns without fail so that worries me.

I figured however it happens, it'll be better to get it done. I'll always love my parents for raising me the best they could and becoming better people and more human; I just hope I don't have to leave them behind in my life's journey. Maybe they'll change and meet me where I'm at in my life and respect my decision. Maybe they'll turn me away. Either way, the next time they see me whether that's Christmas or later depending on how safe everything is, we'll see"	"Hey, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve found yourself like this. I don‚Äôt have any advice here and can see that you‚Äôre probably fine without it, but this random internet stranger is proud of you. :)

Transmasc enby, hoping to medically transition, seeking advice/ support!	"TW: discussion of HRT/ gender affirming surgeries, dysphoria, body parts!
 
Hey everyone! I'm 21 years old, and identify as nonbinary transmasc. I've been out as nonbinary and using they/them pronouns for four years now. Recently, I've begun to consider medically transitioning- with hormones, and possibly also surgeries. But I was hoping to bounce my ideas off of someone/ talk through my plans, because I'm still feeling a little unsure and nervous about this, and don't really have many people I can talk to about this. I'd be grateful for any advice or reassurance!

I definitely have no desire to pass as a man- ideally, I'm just hoping to shoot for a more androgynous look, in order to reduce my crippling dysphoria. 

Here's my (tentative) current plan!

-Microdosing testosterone: I'm hoping to use the lowest dose of T humanly possible, and to have the changes be as slow and gradual as I possibly can. I definitely identify as nonbinary, and have no desire to pass as a man- I suspect that looking too masculine would actually worsen my dysphoria. I've been thinking of just taking T for a limited period of time (maybe several months to a year?), and stopping as soon as I feel that I look sufficiently androgynous or masculine. I spoke to my doctor and he recommended that I try something called Androgel 1%, at either a 12.5 mg or 20 mg dose. Has anyone had experience using this particular T-gel and dose?

-I've also been really worried about accidentally transferring the androgel to others- especially since most of my friends are AFAB and/or identify as cis women. I also suffer from depression and PTSD, so my doctor raised concerns about how T might impact my mood, and recommended that I start seeing a psychiatrist while I transition.

-I'm also hoping to get top surgery at some point. For now, I've mostly just been wearing huge oversized clothing these past few years so I can totally avoid looking at my chest and body. Which has kind of worked, since my chest size is 34B, and all my clothes are massive. But I think I would feel a lot more comfortable with my body if I could have a mastectomy. I'm kind of afraid of surgery and anesthesia though, since I've never had surgery before, and don't really know what to expect!


-I also have no interest in having biological children, and identify as asexual. So... if there's any way I can convince my insurance to approve a total hysterectomy in the next 10 years or so, that may be super helpful to me. All my gynecologist visits have been awful and traumatic so far- never having to do pap smears would be a dream come true, if I can somehow make that happen. But I'm so young that I figure it's very likely my doctors/ insurance won't approve of this procedure. My primary care physician does seem to be supportive, at least.


Any advice on how to decide if I want to medically transition? If you ended up doing any of these procedures yourself, how did you decide?

I still feel kind of nervous and unsure. And sometimes I still question if I'm actually transmasc or not- although I am 1000% sure I'm not a cis woman, and have been out as nonbinary for years, and am generally super comfortable with my pronouns/ gender identity for a while now! It's just this nagging feeling of worry and self-doubt I guess that randomly reappears. Will I ever feel 100% sure about this choice?"	"Hi. I live in a diffrent part of the world. But seems to me we're on the same journey with similar goals!

Your plan sounds more put toghether than my own actually. 
I've gotten so far as deciding to start HRT and that's it. 
I'd really like top surgery... and I have similar thoughts. 

That's realy only thing I'm 100% about though.
It's not like I doubt what I want. But the journey is new and unknown. Scary stuff. But worth it.
We have the benefit of having trashed our body so hard before reconciling who we are that we have no possibility of any transition ourself, but that's neither here nor there for us as our own dysphoria is more a matter of scale than  anything solveable via surgery or HRT. We are on spiro basically to keep ourself alive, our hormones are just all over the place, the doctors kinda have not told us anything useful or actionable about that other than we just sorta get to take pills and keep on living.   
As far as whether or not you'll ever be 100% certain we have no answer and we're not even entirely sure exactly what we are in the first place, because we just know we're not a man and we've never felt like one, and we don't have any idea what being a woman feels like and we can't imagine it so we suspect we're just as is, uncertain and hormonal all the time.  
Sorry if this isn't helpful, but we don't like to say stuff we don't know and we don't like to blow smoke up anyone's butt, we just wanted to say we support you and wish you the best!
Ayo, I've been on 0.3 mg of Testosterone injection shots weekly for about 9 months now so that's where I can help out the most. There's a lot of factors here. Firstly, I am also 21 nonbinary, tend to lean masculine. In my experience I look pretty androgynous now but how I get gendered in public by strangers depends on how I dress or how long my hair is. I've only ever gotten they/them'd by strangers twice. I mostly dress masculine so I typically get he/him'd. So you could be on a higher dose of T but still not get he/him'd, it depends on how your perceived and who's doing the perceiving. 

Also the dosage of T you take plays a factor but does not 100% determine your results. Since it's not necessary how much you take but how your body absorbs and uses the T. So for instance, some people take high dose T for years but still can't grow much body or facial hair. But for others on the same dose they can get a solid beard in like a year. I don't remember the name of it now but there is something you can take with T that prevents an increase of body hair or facial hair. 

I really didn't see any results from T until around 2-3 months and I've stayed on 0.3 mg weekly. The first changes I got were: more leg hair, bottom growth, and deeping voice, and becoming more irritable. These are just to help hear someone else's experience but the only way to know how you'll be affected by T is to take it. Before you get on T they tell you all of the side effects, expected times they'll show up, and lasting effects. You can always stop at any time too but some of your affects will go away.

With Androgel you have to be very careful not to get it on others. But it only takes about 5-10 mins tops to dry and once it's dry there's really no risk to spread it. So after showers or while your brushing your teeth is the perfect time to use it. And as long as the others around you know not to use it or touch where you put it on right after you used it, you're pretty much good. I wanted to take andro-gel but it can be more expensive than injections and injections aren't bad like I was expecting.

I'm lookin into getting top surgery/chest masculinization right now ! It is exciting but it is scary. I've never had surgery or even broken a bone. So it seems scary, especially when everyone else I know has gone through surgery because of a life or death matter. Just because top surgery isn't life or death doesn't mean that it's just a cosmetic surgery, it can still be a positive life change and very much needed. 

Best of luck to you out there !"	s56rrg	NonBinary	4	1.0	2022-01-16 07:46:29
Real time diary: ‚ÄúDo you feel superior to trans people?‚Äù	"I woke up to horrible dysphoria this morning, after a horror movie nightmare. Going back to sleep, I dreamt of being rejected by the beautiful women that I fetishized seemingly all my life. It ended seeing myself sat a park table, bearded and sad. Waking up, I felt a powerful lust for these women again. Lust that made me feel like a man again.

My friends (bless them) called me to play some games. ‚ÄúI know you like (game), why don‚Äôt we play that?‚Äù He said. It felt great playing with him, but I cut things off at 11 for my therapy call. Which turned out to start at 3, giving my friend enough time to fall asleep after his night shift. 

I sat for 4 hours stewing in myself, waiting to explain to my therapist why I had asked for an extra appointment this week. The truth was I was impatient, but I know that if you say ‚Äúno, I can‚Äôt wait‚Äù that therapists will try to make extra time.

I‚Äôve felt triggered by seeing people I know on YouTube announce their transition. It makes me doubt myself for sharing their interests. My therapist asked what I thought of them, and I said I pity them. 

To feel so uncomfortable, to be in so much pain that you feel compelled to... harm themselves. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve seen it. I haven‚Äôt really accepted transition as a means to anything, just a stopgap measure for someone who is unwell. 

These people ARE unwell. The ones I see are depressed, labored in their speech, going on and on about things they can‚Äôt possibly care about, like video games, movies, and so many other things that just don‚Äôt warrant the time needed to write, edit, and record hour-long videos. They are obsessed with... something, and they are undoubtedly avoiding it by focusing on art.

They conclude by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm opening up now, and it feels so good!‚Äù And go on the usual spiel about how they‚Äôve only been open with a few people, but now a huge weight is off their shoulders. I don‚Äôt want to hear it, any of it. 

‚ÄúSo you feel they‚Äôre doing wrong by themselves.‚Äù My therapist interprets from my scattered mumbles. ‚ÄúYes. No. I just don‚Äôt want to be like them.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDo you feel superior to trans people?‚Äù She asks. I do. I truly, truly do. I‚Äôm going to have kids, I‚Äôm going to be conventionally attractive, I‚Äôm going to be accepted no matter what I do. 

‚ÄúNo‚Äù I lie. ‚ÄúNot anymore.‚Äù I try to correct. 

We go over a list of triggers she has been BEGGING me for weeks to offer, and we make plans to meet again and discuss exposure plans. 

I can barely eat for the rest of the day. I‚Äôve cried into my moms arms and she begs me to exercise, go for a walk, eat, SOMETHING. I don‚Äôt want to. I want to call my ex girlfriend and apologize for dumping her in as cruel a way as possible. 

I know that I did so because I was ashamed of feelings, and was tired of her not being able to make me feel better. Accepting my feelings now is no excuse to intrude on her life without me. She said ‚Äúmy love for you is unconditional‚Äù and ‚Äúif you leave I‚Äôll never love anyone again‚Äù and bull fucking shit. She was wrong then I‚Äôm terrified to call and find she‚Äôs come to her senses, and just tell me ‚ÄúYeah, good for you, do what you‚Äôre avoiding doing by calling me‚Äù. 

To imagine her rejection crumples me up like paper, and I agree to get dressed and go for a walk with my mom.

We walk past a little old lady, and I envy her small frame. It takes reaching the end of our housing block and walking on the side of the main road before I agree to eat some food we can buy at the supermarket. Chicken wraps. 

I cry some more hugging my mom, begging to hear about times I‚Äôve been a good person. She tells me to take a shower to give her time to think. As the water heaps upon me, I pray, really PRAY to God and Jesus. It‚Äôs not an old habit, so I mix in some allah just in case. 

Rather than see my friends as people dealing with my bullshit, I thank my God for their company, for their patience. I thank him for making me, so that I might live. Out of the shower, I read a devotional about forgiving myself, meant to hype me up for un upcoming bible verse, and I read it out loud. 2 Corinthians 1:3-7 (whatever that means) and onward until my app doesn‚Äôt offer me anymore to read.

low dose t? whadda hell	"hi i just got reddit and joined some trans subreddits - so i'm transmasc nb and am kinda struggling deciding what i want for my body in terms of transition 
-i'm mostly content with my body, and i don't want to go on a high dose of t or fully look like a cis guy even tho i pass fairly well already
-i'd like to lower my voice a little to be on the lower side of androgynous, and possibly more body hair (mostly tummy) and possibly facial hair? i don't want a lot of hair - i don't really know the extent of what i want and will probably wait until i'm more certain of what i want to start hormones 
-one thing i really like about myself is my skin is really smooth, i'd like to preserve that
-i don't really care about bottom growth
-it sucks you can't just pick what traits you want - also i know i should probably do voice training but that takes effort
-anyway i'm interested in the effects of low dose t, does anyone have experience with the effects? im interested to see if that could work for me :3 thanks guys
-also if this isn't the right place for this, let me know <3"	"low dose T will give you the same effects as high dose T but much more slowly (your individual body also influences time and strength of changes). meaning probably months/years to years. 

USUALLY, voice changes and bottom growth are things many people notice first, then hair growth on legs and tummy.

your facial hair and a different body fat distribution are usually the things that takes the longest, so you really can't be a cherry picker here :D

Concerning the skin: T will influence it; you probably will get some form of (temporary) acne and most definitely pimples in at least one area of face/back/butt/chroch. if you had super smooth skin before, maybe you'll be lucky and it will be OK-ish, but this is inevitable üòÖ
alright, thank you :3 i think i'll try voice training for a bit and see where that gets me"	v8a9h3	NonBinary	3	0.81	2022-06-09 06:15:37
Would it be appropriate to call myself nonbinary?	"So some quick background--I'm a trans man who's been out for around three years now. I started HRT last March and I've never been happier; it's sort of incredible how much better I feel. Up until this point, I've considered myself pretty ""binary"" in the sense that I would prefer to be seen as male, I present as male, and I use he/him pronouns. I am definitely happier in a testosterone based system and I wish to pursue further gender confirmation surgeries, so for most purposes I just consider myself a dude. 

Here's my dilemma--I personally do not subscribe to the gender identity theory. While I know it is helpful for some people (especially when talking to non-queer people), I feel like I'm lying whenever I have to explain why I transitioned was because I ""always knew I was a man"" or something along those lines. It's true that when I was younger I thought I was a ""boy trapped in a girl's body"" and I had a lot of distress about that, but I've reached a place where that no longer makes sense to me. What does feeling ""like a man"" or ""like a woman"" even mean? The idea that brains are gendered isn't strongly supported by science, so I don't feel comfortable saying I ""feel like a man."" Which leads me to where I am now. I consider myself ""politically nonbinary"" in the sense that I would prefer to not be gendered at all, to exist in a society where gender isn't a concept. However, in my day to day interactions I present as a man. To be honest, I don't even care about pronouns that much; the intent is a lot more important. I feel like I wouldn't mind being called ""they"" by other queer people, but usually when I'm called ""they"" it's by transphobic people who see me as a woman but are trying to avoid offense. That bothers me a  lot, because the fact that I'm AFAB does not mean I will never be a 'real' man; my gender is just as authentic as those men who were assigned AMAB. My previous experience presenting as a woman has nothing to do with my claims to my gender.

 At this point in my life, I can relate to experiences in so many narratives--trans men of course, but also butch women, people who have detransitioned, feminist and queer theorists, and of course non-binary people. All this considered, would it be appropriate for me to consider myself ""just"" nonbinary (or a nonbinary trans man), even though I do not have a personal problem with being considered a binary gender by other people?

tl;dr I think gender is fake but I've chosen to pretend to be a man. Should I still consider myself nonbinary?"	"I think that's a valid way to feel. If you're asking whether your feelings are ""non-binary enough"" to use that label, there's no threshold you have to meet in order to qualify. If you feel comfortable describing your experience with that label, you're free to do so. I might try to express those feelings as ""agender non-binary with preferred masc presentation"" or similar, but you are the one that gets to choose the words you use to describe your own experiences.
You may absolutely be non-binary and pursue transition goals that will result in/continue to result in people perceiving you as a man. If necessary, you may lie about being a binary trans man to receive those treatments, because it's not your fault if the medical establishment doesn't understand you and/or is full of gatekeepers. You may use he/him all you like; you may even *think* of yourself as a man first, and still be non-binary, if ""man"" doesn't tell the whole story. You may also stop saying that you always knew you were a man, if you wish: plenty of people who *are* men didn't always know, so breaking that narrative helps them, and anyway, you're valid just the way you are and don't have to package yourself up into a tidy box that other people can easily understand.
This is so similar to how I feel. I‚Äôm a woman but that doesn‚Äôt even really mean anything. Gender is fake, i don‚Äôt care about pronouns, but I‚Äôm also fine with the pronouns I have now and fine with people calling me/seeing me as a woman. ‚ÄúPolitically nonbinary‚Äù is a great term, that‚Äôs exactly how I feel. I don‚Äôt have an answer for you, I‚Äôm in the same boat. Personally, I feel like since I‚Äôm fine with the binary gender I already am, I shouldn‚Äôt call myself nb because that might take away from people who aren‚Äôt comfortable with she/her or he/him and who truly only see themselves as non-binary. Like yeah I could be they/them, but I don‚Äôt have to be, so I should just stick to she/her and save they/them for other people who are nb. Just my thoughts, could be totally wrong, ultimately it‚Äôs probably up to you.
Eh, I used to think ""they"" had to be for people who weren't binary, but honestly it's good to share it around to normalize its use, and I think it helps make it clear that even people who are okay with (or can tolerate) he and/or she aren't necessarily binary."	kynq7r	NonBinary	5	1.0	2021-01-16 17:59:14
I need help with body dysphoria.	I'm AFAB 23 year old, and I've been dealing with a disconnect with my sex and my gender. When I was in high school, I seriously considered the idea that I might be male because I felt I was missing a penis. I didn't *feel* male, except for the desire for male parts, but I also didn't feel wholly female either. Now that I'm a bit older and have a bit more experience, I realize that I'm nonbinary, at least in some way. I don't have a desire to make a full transition, but I'm still feeling like I have the gentalia. I don't care about binding my breasts, but I'm looking for any ways to ease my dysphoria/possible dysmorphia in terms of my vagina. I've asked in several places, and have gotten no answers. Can anyone help me?	"I'm just some cis dude scrolling through /r/all.  But I read [this](http://www.cracked.com/article_22096_6-awful-lessons-i-learned-transitioning-from-female-to-male.html) article on Cracked not long ago.  It was about a man's experience transitioning from female to male and pointed out [this](http://www.peecockproducts.com/index.php?_a=viewCat&catId=1) line of products.  They are wearable prosthetics called Peecocks that might help you.
That article is terrible and I suggest any trans person avoid it. No offense to you, man, I know you're trying to help.
I haven't read the article, at least not yet, but the idea of the prosthetic was distinctly helpful.
I actually thought it was fairly good and hit a lot of the things we usually complain about. The only thing I'd change are the warnings about how awful gender-confirming surgeries are (and to be fair, there is a fairly high complication rate from what I've heard), but I'm sure it's specifically to be in line with Cracked's special brand of horror-humor jokes. 

What did you find terrible about it?
If you check r/ftm and search ""packer"" and ""prosthetic,"" there are a bunch of discussions and reviews of different kinds of prosthetics. The Peecock Gen 2 is pretty well thought of, but there's a variety of others as well, depending on your needs and your budget.
Besides what ebomb said, i just find the tone really ill fitting to the topic. I know that's cracked dot com for you or whatever, but I struggle to *not* feel that pessimistic and shitty about being trans. reading that just made me feel worse.
It read like a torrid expose of the transsexual underground from like 1998. It's inaccurate, misleading, and frankly not funny. Even for Cracked it's bad. 

There's a lot of discussion and criticisms here: http://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/2w0b53/cracked_article_6_awful_lessons_i_learned/
I mean...we're not in that place anymore, where no one knows what testosterone does and surgeons are shady butchers. There's no utility to presenting life as a trans person that way, and no humor in saying, essentially, ""Look how bad this sucks!"" when actually, it doesn't. Leastwise, not in the ways the piece emphasizes. 
That's also very helpful. Thank you very much.
yeah, I get that. It is very pessimistic for most of it. I'm sorry you're feeling shitty about your experience, though :(
I didn't find it funny at all, I just don't think it's the worst description of trans experience in the media, especially considering the site it's published on.
I agree. I think, though, that this is probably this guy's actual experience though, and whether or not you have good surgeons near you is completely up to geography and your financial resources. "	2xw31j	NonBinary	4	1.0	2015-03-04 09:06:52
advice on discussing transition with parents	"Hi! My name is Mac (they/them) and I am afab and I'm 19. Now that I'm in college my insurance covers trans affirming care and I am considering top surgery. I hope to get it done next summer and just hide it from most of my family (sweaters and lies, I dont see them often anyway), but I care about my relationship with my mom and I don't know how to involve her. 

My inclination is to do it without telling her, but she has started using my pronouns and I can tell even though she doesn't understand, she is trying. I have been (safely) binding since I was 14. When she found out about it at first she flipped bc she thought i would permanently mutilate myself and that it was more of an eating disorder thing... She also read a book anout de-transitioning. We talk a bit about it now and I have tried my best to educate her, but I still feel uncomfortable bringing up surgery because it is a big step and I know she won't understand. I like far from home and don't see her often but we communicate on the phone pretty regularly.

How can I bring it up? How do I explain that it is not internalized patriarchy and I am not just turning my back on women-kind. How do I explain that I don't ""want to be a man"" I am just nonbinary. How do I prepare myself for the hurtful things she might say? How do I communicate the importance that this has to me in a way a cis-het boomer can comprehend?"	"It is almost certainly better to let her know ahead of time, if you wish to maintain that relationship. My spouse has expressed a sense of betrayal when not notified of changes, as that is one of the ways she feels connected and receives love. If your mom is similar, it will almost certainly end up being easier if you bring it up ahead of time.


With that said: if her reaction will likely sway your decisions, you should allow yourself the space to get everything set up in a way that would be difficult to cancel or stop. If that means going through with it first, then go through with it. It is your choice, and not hers, so it's important you respect your decisions first and foremost."	qladwn	NonBinary	5	1.0	2021-11-02 18:11:59
This is who I am.	"I posted this on Facebook today, and I wanted to share here, too. Some background: I came out as trans in 2013 and began transitioning that same year. As you'll read below, nothing is ever clear-cut. But that's okay.

It's Transgender Day of Visibility

This comes in the middle of another one of my seemingly biennial seasons of self-reflection. My gender has always been an issue, even after I transitioned. I just never wanted to believe that. I've always just tried to fit where I thought I should fit, but I've found that I really just don't fit into any predetermined molds.

""Trans woman"" -- It just doesn't quite fit. That's not to say that I'm ""male"" in any way whatsoever, because I'm not. Honestly speaking, I feel like I don't have a gender; or, if I do, it's some undefined gender in the spectrum of genders.

""Genderflux"" -- I stumbled upon this term last week. It's the first term I've ever found that describes how I feel about my gender. It falls under the ""genderfluid"" umbrella. It basically means, for me, that, while my ""base gender"" is agender (or genderless, or undefined), I experience gender in varying intensity, ranging from 0%-75% (in my case, I randomly ""flux"" to feeling like I'm up to 75% ""female""). It really depends on the day, to be honest.

""What even is gender?"" -- I feel like most people have this kind of understanding about themselves to where they don't really have to ask this question. I've always wanted to understand myself. I have a NEED and a DRIVE to understand myself as a person. Gender presentation is a tricky thing, because, socially, I need to be seen as a ""woman"" because society doesn't understand non-binary genders, and I utterly reject masculinity. I have dysphoria around appearing too ""feminine,"" and it really sucks. I have no idea how to appear more androgynous without people mistaking me for a dude or something. But my appearance will always lean more on the ""feminine"" side, because that's what I am mostly comfortable with.

I personally reject the idea of gender; it's not for me. I know it's for other people, but it's not for me. And that's okay. I'm finally okay with that, I think.

Having extreme self-awareness is a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing because the act of discovering yourself is a beautiful thing. It's a curse because I constantly evolve over time; when you think you know who you are, but still have the drive to figure yourself out because it doesn't exactly feel right, it really kind of sucks. I don't want to ""evolve"" anymore. I want to be the actual person that I am. And right now, this is me.

What's this mean for you? Nothing, really. This is for me.

My primary pronouns are currently singular they (they/them/theirs). I also accept feminine pronouns (she/her/hers).

Anyway, hi. I am Chel (pronounced like ""shell""). You can call me Chelsea, too. I don't care. I am a genderflux trans person.

This is my day of visibility.

Am I non-binary?	"I've lived most of my life as a (feminine) male, and at around age 22 began transition towards (trans) womanhood. In the last year, I had various experiences (physically & spiritually) that mandated me stopping hormone therapy,.

By physically, I mean that I was likely facing adverse effects of long term hormone therapy (using Estradiol patches & cyproterone acetate pills), and gaining weight from it and experiencing other concerning health changes.

By spiritually, I got to a point where I was wondering if I'd make it, and had to reckon with the faith I left years before (christianity), and that began a journey back to reading & following biblical teachings, which has meant making a number of changes in my lifestyle, including ceasing my MtF transition and realizing that God doesn't make mistakes, and that I'd honor Him by honoring what he naturally blessed me with.

Fast forward to now, I'm back to using phytoestrogens and progesterone cream (which are more mild/less dangerous) because I don't want the male physical patterns of aging that I see take hold over time.

I've realized that I don't really want all the upkeep of being female (because tbh it's so involving and draining, caring about wearing certain clothes, the approval of (men's) gaze, comparison to other women, etc etc.

I also don't want to be one the other extreme of being a 'dude' or 'man'. That's just not been me, ever. It's not me.

I'm somewhere in the middle. I like to dress very neutrally, in sweatpants, hoodies, turtle necks, beanies, etc. so I'm not sending out either feminine or masculine vibes. Plus, I like walking out this way knowing that I'm not clawing through the male or female hierarchy/food chain, where certain appearance markers merit more approval points. Being outside of this matrix of presentation is freeing for me.

I still like guys, though, if I could be asexual, that would be awesome, both bc I find physical attraction/desire in general a form of carnality that causes poor judgement/narrow-minded thinking, and bc, in christianity, lust and same-sex attraction are sins.

So, back to gender presentation, or lack thereof. Idk. Do you think that being in this 'neutral' space in between (at least at this stage in my life) means that I'm functionally non-binary?

//Trigger warning ahead//

And btw, I recognize that my gender dysphoria from an early was likely due to a phsychological misallignment/miswiring that led to a skewed interpretation of my own gender. If that's triggering to someone, I apologize."	"There's a lot of stuff in this post that I personally don't agree with, but I'm not here to tell you how to live your life. If you're comfortable with those decisions, you do you. If you feel like your gender exists somewhere outside of solely and completely man and solely and completely woman, which I gather from your description it does, then non-binary may be a good way to describe that experience. There's no test you have to pass, there are no label police. It's available for you to use if you feel like it adequately describes you.
you should check out r/TransChristianity and r/OpenChristian there's nothing wrong with medically transitioning, and God sees and affirms you in your gender. also, nonbinary is not ""x gender but don't want to medically transition"". you can just be a woman even if you don't want to have a super feminine gender presentation. of course, nonbinary is still a term available to you if you wish
Apart from the opinion on psychology  and religious influences (which I'm guessing you disagree with), what else do you disagree with? I'm genuinely curious.

So far, from scrolling a bit through this subreddit, I've noticed that there's a variety of non-binary representations, though I don't really see someone like me, who plays gender down (almost) completely. Thoughts?
oh also queer attraction also aren't sins, fwiw
> the opinion on psychology and religious influences

That's pretty much it. I probably shouldn't have mentioned it at all tbh, sorry about that.

> I've noticed that there's a variety of non-binary representations, though I don't really see someone like me, who plays gender down (almost) completely.

There's no one way to be non-binary. It's an umbrella term that covers a vast array of experiences. Agender is a label under the non-binary umbrella that describes an experience of not really having a connection to any particular gender. And expression/presentation is open to anyone, regardless of gender."	n0q48h	NonBinary	3	0.81	2021-04-28 22:08:26
Non-Binary in East Tennessee	"Hello everyone, afab enby here and I've got two questions!

I'm currently realizing TN is a difficult place to be for enbies. I found a supportive gyno which was super great. She says she's never had a non-binary patient before but is definitely open to learning. When she contacted her endo partner who she refers trans patient to, he said that he won't treat enbies and I was heartbroken. Upon talking to my primary care, I was told that if I could find a doctor anywhere that could give directions and guidelines to her for a non-binary transition she would be more than happy to help me along my path. However, I have no idea how to find a doctor who would be willing to do this. How can I find one?  


I want to be a Futanari. I call myself this on various occasions and it's how my weeb self explains this to other weebs.

Me, nonbinary? I think so?	"I'm 28. AFAB. Openly pansexual. Hi. I'm new to exploring gender identity in general. Like, I never knew there were names for certain identities. I didn't even know being a transperson was a thing until I was maybe 19. I didn't know people could transition. I'd never heard of it before. So just let that sink in. In recent years, I've finally started looking into all that kinda stuff on my own. Basically, right now, I am trying to figure out my label. There are so many different identities out there, which objectively, I understand but I'm not exactly sure which one fits me. So here's a synopsis of me:

I grew up hating my name. First name is Mary, which I always thought was too girly. I hated it. I always went by my middle name because it's less girly, but I still didn't like it either. I was always more of a tomboy and it wasn't until I was 15 that I started to wear skirts, but it was only certain styles and I hardly wore them (mostly because I'm just more comfortable in jeans). I also always shopped both in the boys and girls clothes. I never understood why they were even separate. As a child I knew that clothes were clothes. That's it. Why did they have to be separate, and why did the girls clothes have to be more expensive? Lol. I remember as a child, I walked into a women's bathroom at a store and there was a transwoman in there, washing her hands. In my child head, I saw a man dressed as a woman (so sorry about that, I'm no longer ignorant, I promise!) but it's not like it bothered me. It was more of an acknowledgement thing. I smiled at her as I always did with strangers, I did my business, and then I left. To me, in my child head, it was perfectly acceptable for a man to wear women's clothes because I also liked to wear boy's clothes. The point of this part is that clothes in general are gender neutral to me. I don't define gender based on what someone's wearing.

However, when it comes to ""being"" a girl, I never felt that. I never wanted to be called a girl. I knew what a girl was ""supposed"" to be because I would get teased for dressing/acting like a boy. Women tend to embrace their gender. They're proud to be that gender. Men do this too. Objectively, I get it. But personally, I've never felt that. It's not that I want to. I just don't care. It's not an active part of my life or my thoughts. To me, it's like a baseball player being SUPER proud of their abilities and what they've accomplished. And I'm just over here like, ""Cool! Super happy for you! Can't relate, but nice!"" I'm not a ""baseball player"" like everyone else. It's totally unrelated to my life. (Replace ""gender identities"" with ""baseball player"" and that's my point. Lol.)

It's also not that I hate being called ""she"" (or ""he"" in A LOT of instances). I don't mind either, honestly. I don't care what pronouns are used for me. I'm just existing. I don't want my identity to be based on any gender, especially not on gender stereotypes.

I really hope this makes sense. I really hope someone out there understands EXACTLY what I'm feeling/thinking so I know I'm not just being an overcomplicated dimwit or something.

Am I nonbinary? Am I considered any label under the nonbinary umbrella? Am I just a female overthinking this stuff? I'm just really confused as to what I am."	"[deleted]
This honestly helps me a lot. It's puts gender identity into a better perspective. Thank you so much! Sounds like I've got a lot of research and experimenting to do! (Which is fun for me!)"	irk77s	NonBinary	3	1.0	2020-09-12 20:33:08
Need Help with Mine and a Friend's Insecurities	"Hey everyone. I've decided to share this here hoping for someone to help in such a large community here on reddit. For the past 2 years or so I‚Äôve been feeling terrible and unsure of how to cope with something between an old friend and I. I‚Äôve frequented this community for a long time and felt this would be a safe space to reach out I hope.

Firstly, there are a lot of definitely problematic things this friend has done, but I am trying to pick apart and understand if I‚Äôm justified for the lesser things, and if not, why it might be affecting me so much.

This friend is from a place that is not as trans-friendly. For years they‚Äôve been in denial about being trans and always seemed to look up to me and be supportive of my transition. But over the course of about 8 years it seemed like they were always kind of jealous or unsettled in their skin, but I knew it wasn‚Äôt my place to break their egg.

Through hanging out with our group of friends, they‚Äôve always been the religious type to wear dresses, love taking care of everyone etc. but would lie about what manga or anime they‚Äôve experienced to fit in with our group and knowing this was just harmless wanting to fit in, I offered them to come out to gay clubs, kink events, do some cross-play with me, makeup etc. but they said those things weren‚Äôt their thing. I also managed to teach our friends a lot about politics that I feel strongly about, as well as things in the occult, as that was a large part of my life awhile back.

On group chat I was expressing that I had major chest dysphoria that week and they out of nowhere shared photos from their drag king debut that they never told us about. I was really happy for them, though it felt kind of like they were being really up in my face about it, considering they were still claiming to be cis. Later in the year they asked to borrow my gothic clothing (which I used for sex work) for a Halloween Goth Drag show as they called it. As someone who is considered a goth, I didn‚Äôt mind, but then later I saw on a different social media platform that they were doing a drag routine ‚Äúrespectfully impersonating a gothic sex worker‚Äù and shaved their head like mine. They also thanked their friend for lending them their makeup but never mentioned me (I‚Äôm not really saying that I wanted to be thanked but still) and then had this whole description of how you can support sex workers. And like. I was just getting more known in my community and had previously dealt with some pretty traumatic physical assault stuff at work, where this friend never really seemed to know how to support me before. Essentially all of their drag that year was themed around the political views they literally just learned about and appropriating the occult. They also started to have a lot of posts about supporting trans people and would say things like ‚Äúwe‚Äù in it, which gave me 2 possible ideas. That either, this friend realized that they might be trans, but didn‚Äôt want to tell me. Or, this was a cis person, using a degree of privilege to perform within the community (not saying cis people can‚Äôt do drag at all by the way - it was just beginning to get under my skin because they were starting to give me unsolicited advice on say, binding, when I have been doing binding since I was little and this person literally just started drag, and, at the time, all I could do is take their word for it that they were cis, and due to them being ok being topless, probably weren‚Äôt suffering the same degree of dysphoria I was). They had a photo from when they were a kid saying that they have been trying to masculinize themself since they were 8 years old, but for the vast majority of our friends knowing them (almost a full decade), they would be quite feminine, so I feel like they were attempting to recapture lost youth or something because they would also seemingly try to rub it in that they are a couple years younger than me and have their life ahead of them as the baby of the group. I‚Äôve seen this with a few trans guys so that‚Äôs also why I felt like I knew what was coming.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs always necessary to have an honest and accurate representation of one‚Äôs journey on their social media timeline, but it just really hurt that they needed this separate world from me as their best friend to have this portrayal of a person who has apparently been in the community their entire life. \*\*I feel like I took this person in and showed them a lot about the community and spaces to go in the city, and then they just went ahead pretending like they were in fact going to teach our group how to be good cis allies, while playing it off as though they were doing that all for me, as the only known trans person of the group this entire time.\*\* Like I knew it was a little strange when a supposedly cis friend offered me a book on ‚Äúthey‚Äù pronouns to share with people when I‚Äôve been dealing with educating people my entire life as a nonbinary trans person. I took all these things in good faith at first but now I just don‚Äôt know how to feel.

Now. I know that this person is allowed to like the same things as me. I know that I cannot gate keep, nor do I want to. I also don‚Äôt think I need to be credited as someone who probably inspired a lot of their drag. I can also look at this sometimes as an innocent way of coping with internalized issues. But it just really bothered me. I tried talking to them about this and they just kept denying and got really upset saying that I was selfish and that it's not always about me. They essentially said that I was self-absorbed and always had to be the centre of attention and then didn't want to hang out for months, saying it was just their mental health. I essentially just tried to work on myself, and for awhile I was wondering if I was just bitter that I hadn‚Äôt done pure drag concepts in awhile, just loads of cosplaying as masculine characters. But when I started to revisit that, I realised that wasn‚Äôt it. I was still feeling really empty and hurt. I also found it strange that during all of this they offered in being a manager for a project I was working on. I was getting a lot of mixed messages on if they wanted to have anything to do with me.

It also came to the point that after saying that they weren‚Äôt interested in coming out to my kinky dungeon birthday or Halloween parties, they then invited our group of friends out to a kink event and said they would be going in drag. This is where I kind of exploded in a very anxious and embarrassing way, because firstly, this wasn‚Äôt a private environment, which I think would have been more safe and overall positive for our group of friends to experience for their first time, and also, it felt as though they just wanted to have a degree of control in what our group did and then if I were to be honest with myself, I suppose a fear was born deep inside of me that this event would be used as some sort of performative woke routine on instagram or whatever. They essentially shut me down and said they would not apologize and that they couldn‚Äôt believe the way I was talking to them and then from then on whenever we would hang out they would be prying into my top surgery details, what surgeon was working on me, what I was having done etc. They were also beginning to talk more ‚Äúbro‚Äù to me, adding a bunch of wink face emojis in our chats, over using dominant body language around our friends which made us super uncomfortable, and also speaking in black vernacular which was really out of left field for this super timid white christian that our group used to know.

On international trans visibility day last year I painted my hair in the trans flag colors and then when they saw that I think they wanted to talk asap because they had posted on instagram with their face painted as the trans flag (which I suppose they were worrying of looking like an appropriating cis person or something) and then told me ‚ÄúI think I might actually be trans after all‚Äù. And so I listened, and offered whatever support I could, just like I had for the years prior. I also asked what they wanted to be referred to as, and if they wanted me to help address new pronouns for their birthday party which I organized and again, they based their next drag concept off of with the things I bought them but again, never really thanked me. Then it seemed as though they got all the info out they wanted from me, when they were asking really personal questions about my medical transition. I was homeless on my birthday and this person used to be really great with making me feel special on my birthday but this time no phone call or anything. Anyways I was getting top surgery finally this year and then last I heard they were also getting top surgery this year too and although kind of shocked at how fast this was I was super happy for them. They contacted me and proceeded to tell me (can‚Äôt tell if it was insecure bragging) that they got a businessman job and get to wear a fancy business suit and got to propose to their partner etc. Again, I was super happy for them, but it seemed like they still haven‚Äôt gotten the bigger picture and how their behaviour impacted me. After saying everything was cool and that I was family, they blocked me on social media and when I asked about it they said they couldn‚Äôt be there for me during my medical transition. They still don‚Äôt seem to want to talk to me, it just was a really rough go for both of us and I really do feel bad for them, but I just can‚Äôt help but feel used, copied and kind of spited.

Whenever common friends would ask what's up they would just say that we weren't bringing the best out of each-other, but I really did try to fix and address things. I just wish they could just sort of admit that at this point, because I really thought we were finally good and over this stuff, they could just admit that it's a ""them"" problem. It's put me in this sort of forced submission of feeling guilty and bad for almost 2 years now, being told everything is fine and then getting bizarre messages like ""hey bro I know things have been rough between us and probably will be for a long time, but just know you're my fam and I love you"". They said that they know this is anxiety-inducing for me, but that I need to respect that they need time away. And like, I've been well and over this, and never really asked to hang out anyways. I just wanted answers for why this treatment. Especially after having way more important and life changing things happen this past year. Being on the streets and literally seeing people die under an unjust system has made me realise the bigger issues in the world and to come back to this just feels petty and insignificant. So why does it still hurt so much.

==========

TLDR My old best friend finally came out as trans but seemed to be holding a lot against me and taking it out on me in the form of appropriating the type of lifestyle I have, my overall style (less important), and my belief system for seemingly performative purposes and all I can feel is horribly petty for feeling icky about this instead of being happy. I just wish they would acknowledge the things they might have been inspired from, or at least would have been honest with me about their interests, dreams and where they were with their identity, but they essentially told me that they don‚Äôt owe me anything. Their trans journey is super valid, but I felt like they were prying about my journey for their own gain and then wouldn‚Äôt share anything with me. It just seemed like they were making friends in the drag community and being secret about them realizing that they‚Äôre trans‚Ä¶ I feel kind of gaslit because they said everything was fine for like 2 years and then just started being super passive aggressive with things and distant. And yes, they don‚Äôt owe me anything. But then was this even a friendship? I know dysphoria can really screw with a person. But still. Why do I feel this way.

Transgender dysphoria blues.	"A letter to someone, somewhere, someday, maybe.

I woke up really anxious today, and I am unsure what has caused this. However, my focus on the one thing I try to ignore is certainly not helping. I called someone two nights ago, in tears. But trying to explain what it‚Äôs like to be secretly trans to a cis-gendered person is not an easy task. I have a routine I follow to minimize the pain this issue causes me. It is actually quite simple, I gaslight myself so heavily that at times I start to truly believe it. The ‚Äúit‚Äù being that I'm not actually trans, and should just live as a girl. I‚Äôm so good at filling a position I wasn‚Äôt made for, that I choose to continuously fill it, regardless of the pain it causes. But then every three months or so I remember I‚Äôm truly unhappy in my given situation that I cry about it, then I begin the cycle of gaslighting and pretending again. I feel this is easier than risking my family, security, and access to education and health care.

I know the world still views me as a woman, so I tell myself to just be one. Because I realistically know that if people can‚Äôt respect me now for who I am, they certainly won‚Äôt accept me if I tell them who I truly want to be. What sets off my quarterly crying and sulking episode varies each time. Sometimes being caused the realization I will never be able to love a man the way another man would. Sometimes it's putting on my favorite pair of boxers only to feel incomplete. However, regardless of what upsets me, I find myself pretending to be a woman after each one because I have no other options at this current moment. I feel I am too trans for straight men, and not trans enough for gay men. This leaves me in this weird grey area where I am unsure which group I should associate myself with romantically.

My current issue lies with what I want to pursue in the future, and while I've had fleeting thoughts of top surgery and hormones, I never allow myself to think about it long enough to make a decision. This is because I feel I shouldn‚Äôt put myself through pain over something I cannot fix right now. I was asked two nights ago what I would do if I could safely transition right now, and I was not able to give a solid answer. This is in part due to my inability to commit to permanent changes, and in part to the gaslighting, I put myself through, which makes me doubt if deep down I'm truly trans.

The kind of sadness this causes is indescribable to someone who has not felt it themselves. There are parts of life that are constant reminders of being in the closet, like bathrooms, gendered stereotypes, the way men look at me, and the expectations placed on me by society. I don‚Äôt want kids, I don‚Äôt want to work in a stupid corporate office as a receptionist, and I especially don‚Äôt want to spend the rest of my life being perceived as something I‚Äôm not. While I am unsure what path I want to take in regard to my transition, that is not a reason to be invalidated by others. Including those who had the honor of being able to transition in a safe and timely manner. That is said not out of jealousy, but out of a desire of respect from others. I feel many people don‚Äôt know it is a privilege to be able to socially and medically transition in peace.

I know my statistics. I know what I am facing, regardless if I transition or not. My risks are not just fleeting thoughts, but numbers and percentages burned into my brain. I continue to ignore these the same way I ignore the fact of my transness."		11y2wy1	NonBinary	3	1.0	2023-03-22 01:53:42
Little to no social dysphoria when knowing you dont pass?	"Hi, enby here. Im fairly sure im enby because of gender euphoria and envy but my lack of dysphoria gives me impostor syndrome.

I cant really transition yet. My environment is quite enby-phobic so I dont feel comfortable coming out yet.
When I know im dressed like my agab, I dont care much if ppl see me as my agab but I certainly dont like it. It feels kinda dissociated, feeling nothing towards it. Mostly it's just ""this is wrong, but I can still function.""
I know I'll look like my agab so im not mad or really uncomfortable when ppl see me as such. Its like, knowing youve fucked up ur test and like you expected, get a shitty grade. Youve expected it, so you arent really upset but bviously you aint enthoustic/happy either. 
These people simply dont know better and wont until you tell them. Sometimes it makes me cringe tho, especially if its *really* gendered. If they would constantly repeat it, it makes me irritated/uncomfortable 

Two ppl IRL know im questioning gender. When they call me by feminine terms (im afab) it feels wrong. It makes me uncomfortable. I mean, they dont know im enby but they do know im prolly not cis and therefore prolly aint a woman. If we go back to the test anology, it feels like you may get a sufficient grade, but you fail anyway which kinda sucks. They dont know what terms I like so again, I cant be really upset abt it as im not out yet. 

So, do you guys perhaps relate w/ this as well? Is it common for trans folks to feel little to no social discomfort when they know they dont pass"	"Our gender isn't defined by the discomfort we feel related to our gender; that would be circular. Dysphoria is not a requirement to be any gender. Some trans and non-binary people experience dysphoria under those circumstances, and some don't. Either way doesn't make one trans or non-binary or cis.
It sounds more like you have coping methods to deal with a shitty situation rather than the situation doesn't bother you. You've spent some time thinking about why it makes sense for this unfortunate thing to happen. You've practiced acceptance. You've emotionally disconnected from it and tried to view it as something impersonal to you. You focus on a time in the future when you think things will be better.

That sounds like an active attempt to deal with discomfort and dysphoria, rather than a true natural lack of a problem. While you know your own feelings best, I think after transitioning it's common for people to find they have been dealing with more dysphoria than they realized, they just had no other situation to compare it to.

Even so, you're not required to have dysphoria to be trans, and you're certainly not required to actively suffer from it. It's great that you're finding ways to work through the situation! Your identity is valid regardless of how others treat you."	10dh9kx	NonBinary	3	1.0	2023-01-16 15:24:14
Identity crisis	"So, my gender is already at a pretty comfortable place. I‚Äôm genderfluid and I‚Äôm pretty confident in that identity, but the thing is that names an pronouns recently have been stressing me out. I keep changing my name, I‚Äôve already changed it 3 times (one was before I even knew I was trans) and I worry that my constant name changing is frustrating people, specifically my friends. I‚Äôm not worried about my family cuz they very obviously don‚Äôt care about deadnaming me and even tell me that ‚Äúthat name doesn‚Äôt fit you‚Äù. I consider my name change almost one of the biggest parts of what will be my personal transition. I‚Äôm struggling to find a name that I like and don‚Äôt end up hating after a few days. I want a name that‚Äôs gender neutral cuz I‚Äôve tried two different masc names in the name of liberation cuz I liked having complete control over my name and still being non-binary. I just want to find a name that I love and won‚Äôt come to hate in a few days/weeks.

Pronouns are also a much more recent stressor because I find that He/She is what I like best but what if my gender goes through a shift to a more enby stance or even an agender stance, both parts of the spectrum seem to appear very recently with my gender. So Ive thought about using neopronouns but that‚Äôs even more confusing to a lot of people."	"There is absolutely nothing wrong in changing your name to suit your identity. I have changed my name a few times, too, legally. 

I was lucky enough to have friends who don't deadname me, as I go by different names in different online games and such. It really is not that hard to call people different names under different circumstances. 

People deadnameing you is 100% their problem, not yours. You did nothing wrong. 

As for how to find a name that you like, I really have no clue. It may be even more difficult for you as you are gender fluid. 

 My suggestion is, don't go by weird spellings (like ""ashleigh"" instead of ""ashley"") or one that is difficult to pronounce. I had a french name and nobody pronounces it right therefore I changed it.
Also, my friend talked me out of taking the name ""crowley"" as it gives even more edgelord vibes than my previous name. I am so glad I took her suggestion and not use that name. (no offence to all the Crowleys out there) my name was Damien and yup I was an emo teen."	v7bj50	NonBinary	3	0.81	2022-06-07 23:54:08
It feels like I'm too apathetic about labels to be non-binary?	"I've been having a lot of gender confusion recently. I am afab and started using she/they pronouns. I've never been too uncomfortable with being perceived as a woman but it doesn't feel like an accurate description of who I am. At the same time though, I don't feel any need to transition or change much other than my clothes. I am aware of the demi-girl label, but I'm still not sure.

My main concern though is that I don't really care what others perceive me as, other than knowing that I'd be uncomfortable being seen as a man. So is it even worth it to figure this out if it wouldn't change how I'd interact with the world? I'm okay with being a woman to others, yet I know that's not quite accurate. I'm not sure what question I'm actually asking here lol but I'm just confused."	"You don‚Äôt have to hate your assigned gender to be nonbinary.  A lot of people just don‚Äôt feel a connection to either binary gender, and that‚Äôs okay too! It‚Äôs really flexible and just means whatever you want it to mean lol
I was kinda in the same boat. Like since coming out as agender i'm like not manifestly different at all. You don't need to be AGRESSIVELY non-binary to be non-binary. You can just beee. Know it yourself, tell the people closest to you. It's still a beautiful thing promise.
Gender apathetic is a thing! You just don't really care. Still under the NB umbrella :)
> I don't really care what others perceive me as

It sounds like you may be somewhat agender then, based on that description. Agender and demigirl are compatible labels. You can be somewhere between those two.

In the end, it's up to you how you choose to describe your experiences. All of these labels and more are available to you if you want to use them.
Haha, being apathetic about conforming to a gender is one reason a lot of enbies identify as NB. I don't have any labels more specific than non-binary, that's good enough for me :)
Oh, woah I'd not heard of that! Thanks!
I'd not heard that term either!  Thank you!"	n19xsi	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-04-29 17:49:26
Experience / advice about older AMAB enby name changes?	" 

I'm curious if anyone can relate to my experience of trying to change my name as a middle aged (37) AMAB enby. I have identified as a cis man for most of my life. I still had some social and presentational ways I've always been enby, but it was only a few months ago that I realized I'd been repressing myself and misidentifying myself needlessly.

Since then I've felt delighted with most aspects of my transition to my best self. I feel good shopping for and wearing gender euphoric clothing. I like getting more into fashion and caring about my appearance for the first time in my life. I feel solid about my pronouns being He/Any.

The only thing that's been a big challenge so far has really been my name. It's causing me a fair bit of distress and confusion. My birthname is a normal US masculine name. It's fine, it's still me, no big deal if people use it some of the time. But I still want to change my name. I don't think my birthname does a great job of representing the me I want to be.

I thought I wanted a more fem name based on my online screen name, so I tried changing my name to Cora. But after using Cora for a while I've realized it causes me unpleasant distress. I don't ID as genderfluid, but despite that there are times where I am 100% Cora. If I happen to be presenting very fem on a day, I want my name to be Cora, I feel like Cora and it's euphoric and nice. But most of the time when I'm just (to what others see) a guy with long hair and finger nail polish it induces anxiety because I don't fully identify with the name.

I've made lists of other more enby names I'd consider / maybe enjoy but now I'm worried about whip lashing people with a bunch of different names. Swapping names out on my friends and family is something I *very much* do not want to do. I've been considering:

Coray  
Nyx  
Io  
Nova  
Teal  
Mint

Or maybe just continuing to use my birthname and having Cora as an occasional nick name? But I don't want my wife to call me my birthname all the time ... I just don't know what to do. I don't know what will get me out of this current unpleasant haze of naming confusion for both me and my family."	"hi! I can! I can!! (came out as enby earlier this year, and I'm 48). I also realized recently I'd been repressing myself for most of my life.

I also have a standard male/masculine given name that I've gone by most of my life.  

I also experienced this: 

>I want my name to be Cora, I feel like Cora and it's euphoric and nice. But most of the time when I'm just (to what others see) a guy with long hair and finger nail polish it induces anxiety because I don't fully identify with the name. For me, being amab and in a very masculine/muscular body means I can't pass as femme even if I try really hard at this time. I imagine hormones would change that but am currently (I say currently because I keep learning more) not planning to take them. 

I tried out ""Dee"" as my more androgynous (not that I'm androgynous, I'm more genderclash) name for general use, since I did want to move away from my AMAB name, and I also tried ""Wanda"" which is my chosen name. People were great and used both names, and I knew really quickly that I wanted to be called Wanda, even when I'm mostly masc, even when I'm out in public - ***because that's the name that IS me***. 

Depending on where you live (I live in a more accepting part of the Country for the most part), being fully yourself can be more or less challenging - and not everyone we run into is going to enjoy us in our enby glory - *but that's not our problem*. What has been my challenge is sometimes I'm more ""out"" (femme in my case) in public and I lose confidence and feel judged. That has gone away incrementally over time, and now I just introduce myself to everyone outside of the career spaces (maybe take that on down the road) as Wanda, and it makes me whole and authentic.

The only person who can pick that balance of out-authentic/closet-safefeeling is you, and it depends on where you are, where your head is at, and what kind of feedback you've been getting, way harder to be out as ENBY in Salt Lake City than say San Francisco for example. 

At some point what others think (especially doubters/haters) has become less important to me, because what I am doing is really great, and if they can't understand that, that's their problem and a sign of their weakness, not mine. 

Still not fully there (helloooo dresses in the grocery store soon!) but real change (or progress) takes real time. And it's worth the effort for me.

I recently met a new group of people, and I 'tried on' (for lack of a better term for trying out) a couple of names.
Thanks so much for your words and relating your experiences Wanda! Love the idea of ""genderclash"" hadn't heard that one. Definitely that's me as well. I have multiple facets of different genders I enjoy simultaneously. I like to be gender-complex more than gender-singular.

I live in a small city similar to San Fran in terms of liberal social norms and such, although I go to rural places quite frequently as well, so sort of a mixed bag.

I kind of feel like maybe I haven't yet found ""the name that IS me"" yet. I feel a little psychic stab of pain sometimes when people call me Cora. Less often I feel euphoria. I also get a bit hung up on the ways people will mis-name me based on the name in question too. Like Nyx I'm worried about being called Nick 'cause I really dislike that name. Teal I'm worried they'll think I'm Neal, another name I don't like. Nova I actually really like the sound of, and it's in the first line of Metamorphoses by Ovid, a latin epic poem I was looking for names in. But I'm also not a *huge* fan of the fact that all of a sudden it's a super popular name for new baby girls.

As I type this I'm realizing maybe my biggest problem is overthinking things.

Right now the one I feel most in tune with is Nova. It's just tough trying out different names for reasons, but I guess maybe I need to keep trying different ones until I find the one that works for me.
I  know a male/masculine Nova, and never thought twice about it. Though I did meet him at a Burning Man related thing, so I was already in a pretty safe space at the time. 

I spent some time looking through naming websites for babies and tried saying the ones I liked out loud. and of course months after I picked, Wandavision comes out, so my brain weasels (that unhappy voice that speaks from my traumas) try to tell me its not an authentic name and that I'm bandwagoning, but that's not true at all and I'm able to 'win' those worryfests with myself.
Genderclash is awesome.  :-)"	qfqz9f	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-10-25 21:32:48
Backpacking as a nonbinary person	"Hey everyone, recently I figured out that I‚Äôm non-binary (well, I prefer genderqueer but don‚Äôt care all that much). I‚Äôve slowly been coming out to a few people I know but I mostly want to start expressing it in my daily life - is it still called socially transitioning if it‚Äôs unclear what you‚Äôre transitioning to? One thing I really want is to get a binder, because I very much dislike my boobs. Right now I don‚Äôt think I want to medically transition in any way.

Anyway, next year when this pandemic is hopefully over I want to go backpacking for a few months, maybe even half a year. I‚Äôm looking into Asia specifically, I really want to see Japan and Indonesia, but I‚Äôm not entirely certain about the destination. Originally I figured I‚Äôd just travel as a woman. However since I‚Äôm travelling alone I was thinking it might be safe for me to be able to pass as a guy in certain situations, and that might also be more comfortable to me. Meaning I‚Äôd bring a binder and some ‚Äúmen‚Äôs clothing‚Äù. So I have a couple questions I hoped people here could help me with:

- Is it even possible for someone who is AFAB and not taking any hormones to pass convincingly enough to be safer presenting as a man than as a woman? I‚Äôm not incredibly tall, around 1m70, but I am fairly muscled and not very curvy.

- Am I right in thinking that in some regions travelling as a man alone might be safer than as a woman?

- Regardless of passing as a man, generally I am fairly gender-nonconforming. Would this be seen as strange or cause issues? Obviously it depends on the region, and I‚Äôd be willing to adapt my style of dress a bit in extremely conservative regions, but in general if I wear ‚Äúmen‚Äôs clothing‚Äù and otherwise make no effort to pass could it cause trouble?

- Regarding the binder, has anyone hiked while wearing one? I could of course only wear it in cities, but would it be safe to wear it while hiking or cycling longer distances as well?"	"Hey! I'm a pretty avid hiker (mostly wilderness rather than urban travel though), and I would personally consider my binder a safety hazard if I were to wear it on multi-day hikes, especially in warm weather. I guess it depends on your particular binder and how you feel when wearing it though, so maybe try it out on short hikes beforehand?
some AFAB people can pass pre everything, usually not once they speak though. i never passed until testosterone and top surgery. 

it might be safer to travel as a man, but more dangerous to travel as someone who could be clocked vs just traveling as yourself. 

i would not wear a binder on a hike personally. unless the dysphoria of not wearing a binder is debilitating, i would opt for a compression sports bra.
Thanks for your reply! I‚Äôm definitely going out on some wilderness hikes as well, but I don‚Äôt think I would risk wearing a binder on those anyway. I‚Äôll see if I can try it out on some short hikes in a more hilly region - where I live it‚Äôs completely flat so it probably wouldn‚Äôt bother me anyway...
Yeah that was the consideration I was making as well. I have the luck of having a low voice naturally so I might try it out in a couple local cities and see how it goes, but it‚Äôs probably too much of a risk to count on.

Sports bra does seem the way to go for hikes. Do you happen to know a brand that gives a lot of compression? Most of the ones I‚Äôve found either are comfortable and functioning sports bras intended to make your boobs look better, or really supple light things that barely do anything at all..."	mw2810	NonBinary	3	1.0	2021-04-22 10:59:33
I‚Äôm considering starting T. Anything I should know beforehand?	"Hello all. I have been identifying as non-binary and using they/them pronouns for some time. I have been considering starting HRT with testosterone but wanted to see what other peoples experiences were like. I don‚Äôt see too much info online for what I am looking for. 

My goal is to have an andro appearance rather than transiting from FTM. I am looking into micro-dosing testosterone to achieve my goals. I want to see more facial hair growth (I already have a decent mustache as is) and also a deeper voice. I have a nice facial/body build so I don‚Äôt care to have that change much. 

But I am afraid of my dads male-patterned baldness becoming activated or something too and losing my hair :( 

Anyone micro-dose testosterone or taking full doses that have any advice or resources to check out?"	"Hi!
I'm 23, 2 months on t and i'm a transmasc-leaning enby. My goal with HRT is mainly a deeper voice, and i want to see how my face changes even tho i know it will be a temporary change that will revert when i stop t.
I'm very happy with how my voice is changing, i can already hear the changes !
I identified as ace pre-t and i absolutely didn't expect how much i would crave intimacy and feel stuff down here. I expected those changes but i didn't think i would like them. Finally I'm okay with them and I'm embracing it but it was a surprise. 
About hair, i still didn't notice anything new, which is a good thing for me as i don't really want them.
I'm on half-dose and i have one shot a month (I'll get my 3rd in a few days)
Feel free to ask me anything here or in pm !
> I want to see more facial hair growth

No guarantees, but that's a very common effect of T.  It's not usually one of the quicker effects though, and microdosing slows things down even more, so you may be waiting a while.  You may find that minoxidil is also helpful for encouraging facial hair. 

>and also a deeper voice

Yup; T will likely do that.  Possibly quite soon after you start.

>But I am afraid of my dads male-patterned baldness becoming activated

Hairline change tends to happen quite quickly (the ""corners"" at the top-right and top-left of the forehead that make male hairilnes look more square-shaped) but serious receding/baldness should take much longer (even if you got your dad's baldness gene, which isn't certain).  The good thing about micro-dosing is that the whole process is slowed down, so you can pay attention to your hairline and, if it gets to the limit of what you're willing to accept, you can just stop T, which (roughly speaking) will lock in your hairline at that stage & stop it receding any more, but without turning the clock back to a rounder female hairline.  

>resources to check out?  


My philosophy is that you need a mix of medical sources & first-hand accounts.  On the anecdotal side, here are some stories that may be helpful:

Check out r/transandro :)

I have no personal experience being on T so I can't help with that unfortunately.
Hey, I just hit three months on low dose T! One thing to keep in mind is that microdoses can vary a lot. I was started on about 1/8th of a typical FTM dose, and am now taking a little over half the typical T dose. I started out slowly and quickly realized this was definitely something I wanted. Another thing to remember is that T affects everyone differently, so there is no one timeline for transitioning. I would recommend starting out slowly and feeling it out from there. One thing that helped me decide was looking up videos of peoples‚Äô transition timelines and voice updates and seeing how they varied from person to person. I wish there were more resources for enby transitions.

My goal is also a more andro appearance, especially a deeper voice and more muscle definition. I don‚Äôt have really have visible changes yet, but have more muscle definition (largely because I‚Äôve been working out more), a slightly lower voice, and a more defined jawline. I just checked my hairline after reading the comments but mine looks the same so far. Hope this helps!
Someone in this sub told me a while ago that there are drugs you can take to prevent hair loss! Both sides of my family the men go bald, and my brothers all started in their early 20‚Äôs so I‚Äôm very concerned about this too. 

Also apparently rogain actually works, but you have to keep using it indefinitely, if you stop using it you lose your hair again.
Thank you so much. This response was so nicely done and has so much good information. Thank you for taking the time to reply to me :)
>Someone in this sub told me a while ago that there are drugs you can take to prevent hair loss!

Yup; there are indeed.  But no baldness-prevention drug is 100% effective & consequence-free:

* On the one hand, taking E & a T-blocker virtually guarantees no further hair loss, though it doesn't reverse previous balding (but that's obviously useless for men, cis or trans)
* On the other hand, there are various non-estrogen drugs that are *reasonably* effective for a *reasonable* proportion of people, but aren't 100% effective/reliable & don't affect everyone the same way:
   * Finasteride is one example; it blocks some, but not all, of the effects of T (which may be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your goals; lots of transmascs want bottom growth, but finasteride prevents that).
   * Minoxidil (Rogaine is just a one particular brand - the actual drug is minoxidil) is also decently effective, up to a point.  It can have a side-effect of increased hairiness in other parts of the body, but for transmasc patients that might be a bonus - again it all depends on your specific transition goals.
   * There are a few others (corticosteroids, immunosuppressants), but I'm fuzzy on how they work - a dermatologist might be able to give you more info."	w9hgvv	NonBinary	3	1.0	2022-07-27 15:19:12
Did you lose any friends when you came out?	"And why, I guess? 

I recently came out to my friends as NB and they were pretty accepting of it, but they weren‚Äôt actually very interested in asking me questions about my gender or anything about my transition. 

It was almost like they shrugged it off. They used my correct pronouns and my new name, but it sort of felt like they didn‚Äôt care. Or, more like they were just going through the motions because I wanted them to. After a few minor falling outs, I ended up distancing myself from the group. We‚Äôre not friends anymore."	I don't see what your friends did wrong? If they use your name and pronouns and respect your identity why do they need to show deep personal interest in your gender?	10sd51t	NonBinary	3	0.8	2023-02-03 06:18:51
I am scared to tell my mom.	"I am scared to tell my mom about the fact I am a demi girl.
Context. Lately I been found to have borderline personality disorder and when I told my mom she said it was surely a miss diagnosis or that I diagnosed myself. I don't really like talking about my identity with her. I originally came out to her as a bisexual trans woman, just to find out that lesbian fits better, but once I told her I was lesbian, she said ""well maybe you're still a guy"" and I was like ""no mom, I am not a man"" than every weeks she asks me if I regret transitioning despite the fact I loudly told her that I do not regret it and that I rather been born Afab. And with my BPD in play, that causes alot of frustration and than she asks me why I am constantly me. I am still surprised I still see her as amazing, as she makes sure to not misgender me and she truly cares about me, however I don't like that she tries to shut down my identity every time I reveal lil bits. It's annoying and I don't want to hurt her emotions."	"> she makes sure to not misgender me and she truly cares about me

I think she is trying, which is a good sign that she loves you. Sharing your feelings and being vulnerable will build trust between you.

I never told my mom. And now she is gone.

Has anyone got experience of going deep into MTF transition and later questioning they might be non-binary? This is my situation right now and I really need some good advice.	"Hi, thanks for reading and I hope this post is allowed here, I am really unsure where to go.

I came out as MTF trans a very long time ago and have went quite some way into transition. I've been on hormones for over five years, I have all of the development, I at one time ""passed"" very well but that seems to have went backwards recently.

But lately I'm really questioning my identity. I know I'm not a detrans type, I do not identify with being male. But I do see queer, non-binary people, the sort who frankly weren't visible a few years ago, and I really sometimes want to be like them. Or at least accepted by them.

I've been worn down by misgendering (usually subtle stuff like ""mate"", this being the UK), feeling like a second-class citizen, things that have prevented me from living my life (shaving rashes stopping me just going out daily for over half a decade!), the loneliness, the feeling I'll never be accepted as female. And certainly when these things hit, I wonder if I'd be happier being non-binary and not caring.

I feel like some of it is this sense that nonbinary/queer people, where I live, are so accepted in the alternative and queer scenes, are seen as ""hot"", they always date lots of people, they look super cool. Then someone like me, that's trans and kind of but not quite blends in to the cis crowd, is just... like... sub-human compared to them? Plus I really struggle with the notion of eventually being an ""older woman"", I have always felt like I can't relate to that.

I think I just want the ability to be myself, the funny, outgoing person I can be, the person who wants to do projects and so on that I won't because ""I might out myself"" or something, and to just be carefree, but I know so little about nonbinary stuff and experiences, and obviously I'm a really unusual case because of how far I've went with a more typical binary transition.

But I'm also really worried about how I'd even go about this. I mean, male-to-female-to-nonbinary must be really rare, right? At least among people who've committed and went as far as I have? I'm essentially coming to being nonbinary from being a woman at this point, but with being male assigned as birth. (Maybe this isn't the disadvantage I think it is?)"	"One of my friends (they/she) was MtF when I first met them, then transitioned a few years after to nonbinary. I don‚Äôt know if she changed her medications any, but she works out more now than she used to (got really into CrossFit), and she still uses the women‚Äôs bathroom. 

But that said, people misgendering you doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre wrong about your gender, it means *they‚Äôre* wrong about it. Being nonbinary is its own gender (or lack thereof), not a consolation prize if you can‚Äôt perform your true binary gender adequately. It sounds to me like you still have dysphoria for not passing as a woman, and for people constantly misgendering you, not that you‚Äôre truly nonbinary. If you *are* nonbinary, that‚Äôs great, but I want you to be happy with your true gender, not settling for second best. 

Take some time to think about how much of this is coming from outside you, vs. how much from inside, and the parts from inside you, how much is about finding your true gender, vs. how much is fearing about not doing justice to your true gender.
There is a YouTuber named Bryn Avery that tells their story of transition MtF and then later realized they were non-binary. I love their videos so maybe check out their channel if you‚Äôd like to hear a different perspective that maybe you can relate to!
>I mean, male-to-female-to-nonbinary must be really rare, right? 

Not in the least. There's a *lot* of transfeminine people who re-assess after a few years, in both directions - enbies who really thought they were trans women at first, and vice versa.

And even if it's not an internal thing - even if your reason for wanting to present androgynous or identify as nonbinary is purely about social comfort (after all, you're not wrong that people are dicks to binary trans women), that's 1000% fine & normal too.  If you feel you'd be freer to just be yourself if you weren't fighting a losing battle to get cis people to accept your womanhod, then go for itüëç Try out they/them pronouns, or a short haircut, or a very tight sports bra (or whatever else you have in mind - obviously there's no script for how to be nonbinary) & just see how it makes you feel. 

Worst-case scenario: you find out it's not for you, & go back to identifying as a woman, but with a little bit more self-knowledge.

Side-note:   
I dunno if this is relevant to your experience, but I've had a good time transitioning *physically* MtF while presenting masc socially, & making zero attempt to get cis people to think of me as a woman (I mean, to be fair, I'm not a woman, but y'know what I mean - my transition goals don't require other people's cooperation or approval, which is very freeing)."	11cqqp4	NonBinary	3	0.72	2023-02-26 19:50:12
I hate gender a lot lol	"This is more for self reflection / logging purposes than anything else, so it‚Äôll probably be really long (yes it is in fact extremely long) sorry about that but I mean it‚Äôs not like anyone HAS to read this anyway lolll. I‚Äôm still sharing it in case someone feels like giving me any advice or something. Part of me just wants to share my story with someone ig, it‚Äôs a little cathartic even if it‚Äôs bound to end up with no views and lost in the ocean of posts LMFAO

tw for mentions of both an ed and terf ideologies (just to be clear I‚Äôm not a terf I just mention some of their arguments lol)

I‚Äôm a 16 y/o afab, I‚Äôve identified as ‚Äúehhhh maaaybe sorta nonbinary but still a girl‚Äù for like three years but about three months ago now I had a revelation which was basically ‚Äúoh fuck I‚Äôm DEFINITELY nonbinary and maybe slightly transmasc and I‚Äôve been repressing it for years‚Äù and it was honestly upsetting at the time because it was too much to deal with at once, it kinda hit me like a train even though I could‚Äôve heard it coming directly at me from miles away but chose to ignore it lmao, and I guess it‚Äôs gotten a little less anxiety inducing lately but it‚Äôs still not really,, that much better if I‚Äôm being honest

I‚Äôm still really confused, and constantly terrified that it‚Äôs a phase or that it‚Äôs internalized misogyny or some terfy shit like that. So far what I‚Äôve noticed is: 
- I wished I looked either like a pretty slightly feminine boy, or just looked so androgynous that people would look at me and have no idea ‚Äúwhat‚Äù I am. The thing is, I don‚Äôt want to be a gnc girl, I‚Äôd rather be a gnc boy, if that makes any sense. Not sure I want the sex parts of a guy though??? Not female either. Probably neither which makes this all 10000 times more frustrating 
- I‚Äôve never really felt any extreme dysphoria over my chest, but they don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs a part of my body for some reason, like something about it is just slightly off-putting but tbh I just assumed that was a common experience in women???? I‚Äôve also been curious about binding because it could help me pass a little. I tried binding with a sports bra that was slightly smaller than my size, and when it didn‚Äôt work I cried for some reason LMFAOOO I also want a deeper voice and always end up hating it when my voice comes off as squeaky by accident. 
- I hate it when people call me a woman, a lady, and/or immediately assume I‚Äôm a girl. It just makes me so uncomfortable and I hate the fact that people will always perceive me as a woman. I used to go by ‚Äúany pronouns‚Äù but then people who knew me irl would just refer to me as she all the time so I had so specify they/she/he (they/he/she????) instead. I told my therapist I‚Äôm nb and he took it well but in the end he‚Äôs still an old guy so he keeps referring to me as a woman (if he does it again I‚Äôll nust try to remind him or something)
 - I‚Äôm bi, but it feels as if I like both men and women in a ‚Äúgay‚Äù way. Sorta like, if I was dating a man, I‚Äôd rather it be labeled closer to an mlm relationship than a straight one, but what I want even more is to be seen as literally neither. Not a man or a woman, just a third gender, and for my partner to perceive me in that way. It‚Äôs frustrating because it sounds so amazing but it‚Äôs practically impossible based on what I‚Äôve seen unless my partner was also nonbinary, because maybe then they‚Äôd understand what it‚Äôs like. It‚Äôs discouraging. 

I still find myself scrolling through transmed and especially terf forums as some form of self sabotage or something lmao, reading detrans stories about how they just needed to embrace their womanhood, and how trans is a dangerous misogynistic trend that was created to get rid of women and that I should just accept who I was born as because I‚Äôll only end up more unhappy if I was trans, and thinking ‚Äúwhat if this is me? what if I‚Äôm really just a girl? what if it‚Äôs just a phase and I‚Äôm embarrassing myself and I‚Äôll regret it?‚Äù Two different sides are saying different things and no matter how much research I do I always end up at square one. I have no idea who or what to believe anymore and it‚Äôs really scary. Not to mention that I never really saw any signs of me being uncomfortable with being a woman until a couple years ago. I guess I never really thought about it???? When I hit puberty and my chest grew in size I didn‚Äôt really acknowledge it, I didn‚Äôt hate it but I wasn‚Äôt excited either. They‚Äôd just be there and whenever I‚Äôd notice it was there it was only static in my brain, basically. I don‚Äôt like wearing makeup and never have, but that‚Äôs just because it feels uncomfortable on my face. I‚Äôve always liked skirts and pretty dresses. I just can‚Äôt remember there being any signs.

Sometimes I do just want to be a girl, because it‚Äôd be so much easier and more familiar. I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about whether or not I was passing, or care when people called me a woman. I could just stick to being hyper feminine and stay in that box because it‚Äôs what I know and is easier for me to do. But it doesn‚Äôt feel right, no matter how hard I try to fit back into what I identified as before, it never feels as comfortable as when I imagine myself the way I actually want to look like. I truly wish there was a third sex, because right now, it feels as if nothing I‚Äôll do will ever feel right. I‚Äôd watch a movie or show and find myself either self projecting onto both the male and female characters, or not seeing myself in either of them. It feels as if I have to choose. Either man or a woman. But it just feels so wrong. I‚Äôm upset because it truly feels as if my ideal way to be perceived and exist isn‚Äôt possible. Sure, I can always correct someone when they refer to me as a girl, but it doesn‚Äôt make it hurt any less that they saw me as a girl just from looking at me in the first place. 

But to make it worse somehow, what‚Äôs been bothering me the most lately is that my own negative body image is stopping me from ‚Äútransitioning‚Äù in any way. Even when I was little, I‚Äôd think, wow I‚Äôd look so ugly as a boy, I should just stay a girl because I‚Äôm ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äùprettier‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù by female standards (and knowing that genuinely upset me even though I was like 8, go figure). And I still feel the same way. I‚Äôve struggled with an ed for like three years now, and because I‚Äôm recovering from a restrict-binge type of thing, I‚Äôve gained weight the past year, which isn‚Äôt necessarily bad, but it makes me feel 10 times more insecure in general. For example I feel as if I can‚Äôt have my hair short, because my face is round and it‚Äôd look worse if my hair was short. I recently got it cut into a slightly above shoulder length mullet which was kinda nice I guess, but I still felt like I looked ugly, and I can‚Äôt see myself as anything other than a girl somehow? Like I look in the mirror and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm stuck looking like a girl or an ugly boy. Because like I said, it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd pass anyway. My face is soft and round, my thighs are a little big proportion-wise, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, and my entire body is just soft looking in general. I‚Äôm gonna try weightlifting more often during the summer to see if it helps anything. But what‚Äôs the point if I‚Äôm not gonna pass no matter how hard I try? Sure I could dress super masculine and grow a beard and have short hair but that‚Äôs just not who I want to be either. I just want to look like a feminine boy, but because I‚Äôm born a girl and because of the way my body looks I‚Äôll just look like a regular girl who has shoulder length hair and a flat chest. No matter how much I want it, I won‚Äôt ever be a ‚Äúreal‚Äù guy or even more so a real nonbinary, because the latter is completely impossible biology-wise, unless I was intersex or something, which I‚Äôm not. I was born a girl, and that‚Äôs always going to be holding me back like a singular chain that grabs you by the neck and doesn‚Äôt let you walk away past a certain point. You can walk, but you can only get so far.

But I don‚Äôt know, even if I DID end up just being a woman I fucking hate the concept of gender to begin with. Why the hell does it matter what you were born with? Why does the world feel the need to separate our species into two seemingly completely different categories and make such a big deal out of it??? I understand physically, but socially? Why cant we just exist as people for once, why the hell does gender matter at all? Why can‚Äôt I just be neither??????? I feel like no matter what I‚Äôd still identify as nonbinary in some way shape or form as a way to protest the gender binary anyway. Idk anymore, I‚Äôm tired lmao. If you read through all of this somehow then holy shit  idk what to tell u loll thanks for listening ig :-]"	"Hey, friend. So, what you're feeling is absolutely valid and also probably rather common among non-binary people. I myself resonate with some of what you're going through: always being perceived as a woman straight away, body image issues (including an ed), hurting when people see you as a woman, feeling like neither a man nor a woman, chest... existence. We even have a somewhat similar body type from what what I've read: round face, larger-proportioned thighs, even our height is the same.

  
I know you're struggling with who you are. It seems, at least to me, that you know in your heart that you're not a man or woman. You're neither, and that's okay. You don't have to choose. It may sound easier to just force yourself into the box of ""woman"" and do all of the things society deems ""womanly"", but it won't. You will always feel wrong and out of place if you do that. You can't truly be happy if you force yourself down that path. It might be hard, it might hurt, but it's better to embrace who you are rather than force yourself to be something you're not. You say that you didn't see many signs of being non-binary before, but I think that you feeling that you should be a girl just because you'd be ""prettier"" and subsequently feeling upset over that fact is a sign. Even so, just because you realized a little bit later than some other people doesn't mean you can't be non-binary.

  
And the terfs? Don't worry about them or their arguments. You know who you are better than they do. Women aren't going anywhere, men aren't going anywhere, no gender is going to go extinct just because non-binary people exist. You aren't ""rejecting your womanhood"" because you never had womanhood in the first place. You can't reject something you don't have. The fact that you're in this much turmoil and in this much pain tells me that this isn't just some phase.

I hope things get better for you friend, and I hope one day you can find people who accept you for you and see you the way you see yourself. It's possible, I promise you. I know from experience.
ahh thanks for the reply, it helped a lot !! ig it just takes some time to come to terms with it all, it‚Äôll be okay eventually :-)
Of course! And yeah it definitely can be. I was pretty lucky in that my revelation (for lack of a better term) was mostly just ""well, that explains a lot"". But that's definitely not true for everyone and everyone reacts differently, which is totally normal and okay."	nutnlu	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-06-08 02:02:17
How to you make the final decision to commit to new name?	"I've thought on and off off changing my name, and tried out a few, but nothing stuck in my head.  Even my favorite names on their own, I couldn't see being called.  Then the name Ryan came into my focus and just seemed to fit.  I can see myself as Ryan I think.  And I love the nickname Ry.  It also rhymes pretty close with my birth name so it's a softer transition.  

Then recently I also started thinking of the name Remy.  I think as a name in abstract I do prefer Remy, but I personally see myself more as fitting with Ryan.  

It's weird, cause I've never cared one way or the other about the name Ryan, but none of the names I love on their own ever really felt right and Ryan does. I know it's a common name and sometimes I feel like I should pick something more ""unique"" but I've had 31 years of a name that no one can spell or say so I'm not too mad about the fact that everyone can pronounce Ryan.  

Does all this mean it's the right name?  I have a lot of hangups cause my parents aren't that supportive and there's always been a ton of emphasis on how much they love my birth name and how carefully they chose it, and now my mom has Alzheimer's so my name is one of the last connections to her.  At pride I had a couple good opportunities to introduce myself with my new name but I chickened out and did my birth name.  My husband said that's probably just cause it's new and not cause it's wrong.  It does feel weird and I'm super squirrely about it, but I was the same way when I shortened my birth name a few years ago too.  

I do want my birth nickname to be my middle name which is why I'm hesitant to do Ryan Remy, which I like and would be a solution but doesn't leave much room for my middle name and I'm afraid I will feel really bad if I drop every part of my birth name.  

But sometimes I worry if I commit to Ryan I'll regret it or change my mind down the line.  Picking my own name is such a responsibility and I dont want to mess up.  How are you sure?  Should I magically know?
Thanks for reading."	"Atleast where I live you can change it legally multiple times. So it's not like if you hate it you cant change it again. I've been going by Casey for roughly 9 months and am only now starting to fill out the paperwork so it's not something I decided on overnight. Sadly I think you just end up knowing if a names right for you I know that's probably not the answer you want to hear.
I wasn't really ""sure"", and I didn't magically know. I just went with it anyway. It was maybe a missed opportunity to find a name that I really connected with or that I was in love with, but I don't know if I can really relate to names that way in the first place.

It felt like searching around until I ""knew in my heart"" might take forever. Changing the name I go by was a way to solve a problem for me, and I didn't want to sit around for too long with that problem still not solved.

So I went with a name that had several positive functional attributes (like keeping the same first initial), and that feelings-wise felt ""good enough"" when I tried applying it to myself. The feeling I found were along the lines of ""yeah this seems like it'll do"" (which applied to a few other prospective names too), and not so much ""this is *me*"".

I did kind of leave the door open to another name change (to a feminine name) that the current one (a more gender neutral name) could be retroactively short for, in case my feelings about gender shifted in that direction. Which also leaves me open to inwardly thinking of the current one as short for the potentially-more-feminine one when I hear it. That's one of the good functional factors.

It's been a few months at this point, and I've come out with the new name in most of my daily life. So far, I feel pretty good about the name choice; it does what it says on the tin. And some of the functional factors that went into the choice have kind of made me grow more fond of it feelings-wise too. Like when I think about it I can pat myself on the back for finding a name that functionally fits well into my life in a few different ways at the same time, and that comes with a warm feeling, more so than I was counting on going into it.

I think a name change is going to be a bit of a leap of faith no matter what. You can try things on, but it's hard to be sure how you'll feel about a name after months or years or decades anyway.
As someone who went from having my (long, gendered) name misspelled and mispronounced to literally the most basic nonbinary name, I do not regret it
Thank you for your reply! I don't know how often you can change it here but I know it costs a lot each time.  
Ugh I know you're right.  I am sadly both indecisive and anxious which is not helping me lol.
Thank you so much for you reply, I really appreciate you sharing your journey.  

That makes a lot of sense.  I think because I get to pick it I put too much weight on getting it perfect, but I really like your approach and that made me feel better.  

I guess it's like naming kids.....one of my boys, if I had known everyone was going to shorten his name automatically, I might have picked a different one.  I still like his name (tho obvs if he ever wanted to change it I'd support him....in fact once he told me HE prefers the shortened version of his name I also started using it full time) but it's just one of those things where I might have gone a different route in hindsight.
That is good to know, I def can relate to that, thanks!
It's pricey here as well and there's a 12 month cool down. I can totally relate to that as well. Anxiety and indecisiveness is a huge mental drain.
Oh I see. I'm def going to have to research the technical end more.  I want to get used to a name socially before I officially change it.  And I'm already terrified of telling people I know I'm using a new name.  Yeah, such fun, anxiety, haha. Goes so well with gender stuff üòÖ
After telling a few people it starts to get easier. I personally just find it hard to bring up in conversation.
Oh that's good to know!  Thank you for saying that, I hope it does get easier!
It gets easier.

[help requested] pronoun indifferent but have to write about myself in third person	"Hello kind listeners!

I'm about to start a new job, and my company is asking me to write my own bio in third person that they can then circulate. Pretty standard stuff.

However, I am early in my transition and currently present non-binary on my best days, but still evidently masc on a regular day. I'm at a stage where I've pretty much given up on pronouns as I honestly don't really care if people use he/she/they when referring to me. But this first assignment is absolutely doing my head in - what should I use in writing my bio besides my name?

Example sentence:

Aria graduated from X with a degree in Y. \[He/she/they????\] will be joining us in our North American office in July."	"Personally I would use they/them, so I don‚Äôt encourage gendered presumptions from the get-go. Then just let them use whatever pronoun afterward if it doesn‚Äôt bother you.
If you're comfortable with he, she, and they, then find opportunities in your writing to use all three. ""Aria is excited that she'll be able to join the NA office. He's always been interested in X since they were a child."" Make it clear by example that you use all of those pronouns for yourself.
Maybe they would be best because it's more in the middle and isn't ""man"" or ""woman"" like cis people think he and she is (I know gender doesn't equal pronouns but a lot of cis straight people don't get that) so it could subtly signal to your coworkers you are non binary.
I talked with our marketing and communication department about this, they just reworded it so pronouns weren't used (I also use any but am out at work so wanted to be more representative of my status). In your example you could merge the sentences with a "", and""
If I was confident my workplace was chill, I'd go with ""Ari (he/she/they) graduated from X with a degree in Y"" and then use ""they"" for the rest of the bio. Or possible add a sentence at the end like ""Ari is non-binary, and has no preferred pronouns"" or ""Ari is non-binary and uses he/she/they pronouns"" depending on what's the best fit.

However, if you're not confident your workplace/co-workers are going to be trans-affirming and you use no particular pronoun, there's no shame in being ""stealthily"" non-binary and going by he/him (assuming that ""evidently masc on a regular day"" means people are likely to read you as male unless told otherwise). It's entirely normal for nonbinary people to use different pronouns for different circumstances and work can potentially just be a place where you're a he/him to avoid any potential hassle."	vjbs1w	NonBinary	2	1.0	2022-06-24 00:49:46
Figuring out identity is hard	"I just gotta write me another therapy post, sorry folks.

&#x200B;

So, I've...been trying out 'nonbinary' as an identity lately, and I'm not sure how I feel about it.

&#x200B;

For context, I'm AFAB who has always been GNC and has physical gender dysphoria, but who also really, REALLY struggles with expectations of womanhood and the social consequences of breaking gender roles. I appear pretty androgynously - shaggy medium length hair, men's clothing. And I like that, I wouldn't change that regardless of what I call myself. I have mostly masculine interests (though not exclusively), computers, gaming, cars, etc. And while it's completely ""okay"" for women to be into these, it's also really fucking lonely and often hostile. I also have some 'feminine' interests - reading, gardening, I like some shows and games aimed at women, I think it's more fun to be open about being attracted to men, real and fictional, even those explicitly designed to be attractive to women. Unfortunately, these are the kinds of things that let me clock others, and would be extremely clockable on myself, unless I deny myself them, which sucks. Why should I have to change what I like? I spent years of my life denying myself masculine things, why should I have to do that again but from the other side?

&#x200B;

I'm also bisexual, but am attracted average to femme men, masc-ish nonbinary people, and the occasional futch lesbian, but I /really/ don't self identify as a lesbian, or even a ""queer woman"". I don't want to be seen as a lesbian. I also can't call myself straight, but I feel deeply uncomfortable claiming to be queer or butch, or whatever. I feel like I don't belong in queer social spaces. And I've come to terms with the fact I'm not going to have a relationship at all. I'm...really fucking unfortunate looking, thank god for masks, and not particularly interesting, funny, rich, etc., and I'm not interested in a 'whoever will stoop low enough have me' type of deal, I have no desire to be under any sort of emotional control like that. To be honest, I want to be the one able to do the stooping, to have others want me to want them, but looking as I do now, that's laughable. C'est la vie. There's more to life than romantic relationships.

&#x200B;

But I feel like this alienation from both queer social spaces and 'normie' social spaces is killing me. I feel humiliated in public, I'm not allowed to interact with regular men and women. A lot of men don't like it when 'unfuckable women' dare talk to them, you may as well be subhuman. I understand why, don't want to seem to your friends like you've got low standards, and alone you think it's a waste of time, but it still kind of hurts. And even those who don't mind, you REALLY FEEL the awkward difference between how they would act if you were seen as a dude - suddenly some jokes become off the table, there's a lot of uncomfortable tiptoeing around you, you are at their mercy because you have no power in this social dynamic - if things become too awkward, you're the first get the boot. Women, on the other hand... the complete lack of overlapping interests and behaviour makes it hard to keep up friendships. The typical female social dynamic is not something that comes naturally to me. Finding people who will really overlook all the things you are doing wrong, without anything to compensate for it..... is a pipe dream. Walking into new social spaces, workplaces, classrooms, parties, you know you are at the bottom of the hierarchy and there's no way to climb it. You know you have to stay in your lane. It sucks. You can...try to only make friends with other masculine and outcast women, but there aren't a lot outside of queer circles, and even then....there's a lot of baggage. Some try to overcompensate and act like douchebros, some are TERFs, some are even more cripplingly insecure than I am and we only reinforce the worst in each other.

&#x200B;

I spent some time trying to exclusively identify as transmasc, as I /do/ experience chest dysphoria, and in a vacuum, want other masculine features. It wasn't a huge reach. But trying to train myself out of the feminine habits I've had socialized into me, and the ones inherent to me, fucking sucks. It's like I'm losing who I am. Compared to most women I am ""mannish"" but compared to (gender conforming) men and transmasculine people I'm soft. I'm small. The way I write is comparably feminine. The way I talk, the way I hold myself, all expose me as female. And, socially, young men still terrify me, in much the same way teenage girls do - I know my existence is beholden to them, and they have every right to laugh at me, forcibly ignore me, bully me, attack me. So even if I could become more masculine, my social situation would only get worse. Not to mention my job prospects .... 

&#x200B;

So internally identifying as non-binary - outside either male or female -  didn't feel like a crazy step to take. But something is still not right. I don't want to have to justify and label who I am at all, to be honest. I am me. GNC, nonbinary, genderqueer, whatever! I don't care what you call me. But I want the things I want. I want to wear men's clothes, have the hair I have, have my interests. I want a more masculine body. And I don't want to be visibly queer or trans. If I had a wish to wake up one day as male, to have been born as male, to have some crazy disease outside of my control that masculinizes me? I'd be perfectly fine with that. But I don't want to be forced to admit that's something I would want. Being visibly trans is an admission of that. And socially, I don't want to be queer. I don't consider myself trans. In the situations above, I would also not consider myself trans, even though that would literally be what I am. I don't want to be seen as a cis woman, but I'd prefer it to 'obviously trans'.

&#x200B;

I also...don't want to break the view my family has of me. They see me as some sort of strong, studious girl who doesn't care about what society thinks of women, going into a male dominated field/hobby/etc. They see me as the tomboy little kid I was, but still definitely a little girl. My mother sees a lot of the insecurity she felt as a teenager reflected in me. And I can't break their hearts by telling them otherwise. Things would be irreparably awkward between us, forever, and they're all I have. Without them, I'd be truly alone. They wouldn't disown me, or kick me out, but I know they'd think I was doing the wrong thing, and they'd look at me so sadly. When I was 14, I said I might be bi, and they ceased ever bringing up relationships, celebrity crushes, teasing about my friends, everything, and even now I still get the sad looks whenever my sister mentions her boyfriend. They avoid talking about painful subjects like their lives depend on it, and if my very existence is painful for them....it's not a good situation for anyone. And, I don't know. I want to be their child, her sibling. I wish I were their son, her brother. But I AM their daughter. I AM her sister. I feel like taking that from them strips both of us of our identities. Same with changing my name - I use a shortened, slightly altered version of my birth name, but I'm not ashamed of my birth name (that's why I don't call it my deadname) -  that was /me/. It was always me.

&#x200B;

Maybe I'm just running away from being a failed woman. Maybe I don't experience dysphoria at all, and all of this is cope, something to fixate on to avoid the real issues. Maybe I'm just hoping ""if I transition people will like me more"". Maybe I'm hoping it will allow me to more acceptably interact with the world instead of being forced to waste my time and youth away in solitude and despair. Maybe I'm just running away from the shitty way society sees women. Wanting to have been born male is not an indication of actually being male, after all, or every woman would be 'trans'. Having such conflicting, ""I want to be male but also stay female"" is not an indication of being 'outside the gender binary'. And maybe, I'm just a pervert who wants to look hot for no good reason other than sexual gratification. There's also that to consider, it's near impossible to disentangle -""I want to be hot"" from ""I want to find myself hot"" from ""I couldn't get the bf/gf so I became the bf/gf"". You know, the classic, do I want to be him or fuck him. I don't consider the first desire to be disqualifying. Everyone /wants/ to be hot, especially people who have been treated like shit for being ugly. But the last....can come from some very unhealthy thoughts. Am I just upset I'm forever alone and doing anything to alleviate that? I can't prove otherwise.

&#x200B;

REGARDLESS, I'm going to be getting top surgery, as even if you were to have a genie curse me to have to live my life as a 100% forced-to-be-cis woman stuck on a deserted island after, I'd still do it - my problems are more to do with the physical feeling of my chest, the movement, the brain-body map disconnect, more-so than just how it looks or what it means socially, whether you have to wear a shirt, whether men or women will find it attractive. I have to at least claim to be non-binary to do it with insurance, though, which is stressing me out, because I don't know if I am. I don't really think top means squat for my identity -there are flat chested cis women, who like being flat chested. There are cis butch lesbians who have top surgery and still identify as women, why not cis non-lesbians. There are nb people and trans men who don't get top surgery. It doesn't mean I /have/ to identify as anything... And I keep fantasizing about dealing with my other dysphoria and going on T temporarily - truly, there are things I....at least covet, voice, facial hair, muscle, genital growth, but I...I'm not a man for sure, even if I want masculine characteristics. It doesn't give me some things I desperately would want, like narrow hips and half a foot in height, masc facial structure, the years of male socialization. And doing this would make me visibly trans, which I don't want. 

&#x200B;

So does that mean I'm a fucked up cis woman? Nonbinary? Demihemisemigirlboy? Truth be told, I don't know what it means to feel like a woman or man or feel like neither a man nor a woman, I'm just me. I just want to be me, I don't want to have to modulate my behavior to fit any sort of expectations, and not be hated for it. I don't want to have to think about gender. And as much as people say ""you can act however you like, as a woman/enby/man"", we all know there are consequences. All options here kind of suck. I want to be cis, but that makes me MISERABLE. I want to be trans, but that makes me feel like a liar, a pervert, and a disappointment, and DOOMED. I want to be non-binary, but I feel like that is just the worst parts of both of those options. Fuck. I want to look and feel like an androgynous male, interact with my peers and romantic interests as anything but female, without gendered expectations I can't meet, and stay a woman to my family. Nothing can be done to satisfy all these options. There's no such thing as a male woman.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Not really much point in asking for advice - I ask in trans friendly places and 100% of people will say, yes, you're whatever you say you are, you are valid, and if I ask on other forums I'll just get TERF talking points, you will always be a woman, you're confused, deluded. If only you knew how bad things really were. Neither side taking into account what I say and just keeping up their dogmatic slogans.

Can masc/fem aligned nb people describe how they feel and how they're separate from binary men/women? (questioning)	"Hi everyone! I'm a transmasc person (using a throwaway because irl people know my main). I've been on T for over 4 years and I had top surgery 3 years ago. I'm consistently read entirely as a cis man. I have no desire to detransition and am very happy with my stereotypically masculine body, but I really don't feel that attached to the gender binary. I really really don't want to be called a woman or seen as female, but I'm somewhat indifferent to maleness. I feel really uncomfortable with being called ""she"" but I don't care if someone calls me ""he"" or ""they"". I would like to present more androgynously. I wear basic clothes (plain shorts or jeans, plain t shirts, plain sneakers) that are technically andro, but it's seen as masc just because I look masculine. If I could place myself on a scale with ""male"" at one end and ""female"" at the other and ""neutral"" in the middle, I'd be on the male half of the spectrum, but closer to the ""neutral"" end than the male one. I would like to hear about the experiences of other people because it's weird to be questioning my labels and identity again after transitioning to male so long ago."	"That's pretty much it. I am more comfortable in the male box than female but I don't really feel comfortable describing myself as ""a man"". I'm open to changing if I ever feel better about it but I could also stay in this identity forever. Don't care if people read me as a man, really do care if people read me as a female (hate it), so I'm kind of a man by default."	k8ouw1	NonBinary	2	1.0	2020-12-07 20:34:27
I have a problem (name-related anxiety, help appreciated!)	"This is going to be a long read, but there‚Äôs no way for me to TLDR this as I feel like I have to lay out all the details.

So, I‚Äôm non-binary, AMAB, and have been going by Ezra since I transitioned.

The truth is, I feel like I‚Äôm more female leaning than male leaning for sure. I generally like to present myself in a more feminine manner. If I were to have been born biologically female, then I think I would feel comfortable in that gender identity.

Despite that though, I don‚Äôt consider myself trans MtF. There are two main reasons for this:

1. I don‚Äôt want to carry the burden of the social expectations that come with existing in the gender binary. I would rather not feel pressured to conform to anything
2. I can‚Äôt just deny that I simply do not and will not pass as female to most of the world. If I were to go by female pronouns then it would create awkwardness for me cause of that disconnect between how I see myself and how others see me. Being non-binary is a lot safer. I can pass as androgynous

Also 3. kind of links into number 1, but I don‚Äôt feel dysphoria all the time. I do experience it daily and it is intense, but not 24/7

I‚Äôm comfortable being non-binary, but the reason all of this feels like a problem is because I can‚Äôt decide on a name.

The thing is, there are so, \*so\* few names out there that are genuinely gender neutral. The vast majority of names swing heavily in one direction or the other.¬†

There are lots of male names out there that I love (Silas, Felix, Xander) that I unfortunately feel like I need to reject because they‚Äôre so heavily male and I would get dysphoria.

There are also lots of female names out there that I love (Eliza, Cheryl, Sylvian), but also feel as though I can‚Äôt pick them. With the female names though, it isn‚Äôt because of dysphoria like with the male ones. It‚Äôs because of point 2 as mentioned above - I simply don‚Äôt pass as female to most people, especially at work or something where I have to tie my hair up and am undoubtably male presenting as a result.

I really wish I could pick a 100% female name, but I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm worried about that disconnect. People are going to see me and think ‚Äúa guy with a girl‚Äôs name??‚Äù And think it‚Äôs off and weird, and I am afraid of that judgement and awkwardness. I‚Äôm not in school anymore, so it‚Äôs not like I would get bullied or harassed for it or anything, but I still worry about how people would think of it.¬†

Ideally, I would want a name that most people would think of as feminine upon hearing it, but if it were to be on a guy instead then they wouldn‚Äôt be surprised or do a double take or anything.¬†

So this brings me onto the name I chose when I came out as non-binary in June - Ezra. When I first came across this name, I thought it was perfect, because it felt female leaning and was also super cool and I felt like it suited me really well. I was really excited to use it.

Welp turns out I was wrong - apparently it‚Äôs a male name. Lots of people still see it as gender neutral it seems like, but there‚Äôs also people out there that think it‚Äôs strictly masculine which surprised and disappointed me. After looking into the name more I can‚Äôt deny that it‚Äôs a lot more common for men than women.

So now I get that uncomfortable dysphoria from it as I mentioned with the other male names :/ Even though I still feel like it is a neutral name, and I know that many others will too, I can‚Äôt get it out of my head that there will be a handful of people that perceive it as a male name. Even when I came out to my sister with my name she said ‚Äúisn‚Äôt that a boy‚Äôs name though‚Äù and I can‚Äôt really blame her but hearing that exacerbated my dysphoria and really makes me second guess the whole thing.

I think I‚Äôm too obsessed with trying to control other people‚Äôs perceptions of me and it‚Äôs messing me up on the inside. It feels so unhealthy‚Ä¶

Anyway, in truth, before Ezra, I actually went by the name Esra instead. It‚Äôs a very similar name, but I feel like the S makes it look more feminine, and that was the goal. This was the actual name I went with when I came out, I only switched it to Ezra very recently.

I genuinely thought Esra was perfect. I loved it, for about a month, until it was pointed out to me that‚Ä¶ it spells ‚ÄòArse‚Äô backwards, and this really turned me off. Now every time I think about this spelling I can‚Äôt help but think about the backwards spelling of it as well and it genuinely bothers me.

It also made me extremely anxious that there was a possibility of people in my life noticing the backwards spelling and not being able to get it out of their heads either and the name would be ruined for them too. I‚Äôd feel so uncomfortable feeling like when others perceive me they‚Äôd be reminded of the backwards spelling. I know that normal people don‚Äôt go around reading names backwards so no one will probably ever notice, but the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù genuinely terrifies me. Even if they didn‚Äôt harass me for it, which they wouldn‚Äôt, the fact that it even crosses their mind is enough to make me feel uncomfortable. Again, I care too much about how OTHERS perceive it‚Ä¶

This really annoys me because Esra was literally the perfect name for me, and now I feel like it‚Äôs unusable for me because I can‚Äôt get this stupid thing out of my head. I thought I might get over it with time, but it‚Äôs been a month since I found out and I‚Äôm still not over it.

So I made the switch to Ezra recently, an unfortunately mostly male name apparently :( I guess you could almost make fun of Ezra‚Äôs backwards spelling as well, but I would read it as ‚ÄúAr-Zee‚Äù and i don‚Äôt think people would pick up on it and it‚Äôs a lot more manageable for me. I can actually think about the name without the backwards spelling running through my head as well most of the time.

It makes me feel kind of insane that I overthink so much about this one single letter.

At this point I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I feel like changing my name from Esra to Ezra, as well as not feeling comfortable with giving myself a purely female name, is me giving in to this irrational anxiety that I experience instead of trying to overcome it, which might be unhealthy in the long run.

So I guess ideally, to avoid the anxiety and the dysphoria, I would want a female leaning name that would also work on a boy. I thought Ezra would be the one but sadly that‚Äôs seen as male leaning.

The only ones I can find that I genuinely like that fit this description would be Erin or Ezri. Ezri is quite out there so I‚Äôm not sure, but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs a feminised version of Ezra, and i could also see it on a boy. I don‚Äôt see any flaws with Erin either, I could see that on a boy personally.

It still makes me pretty sad though because Ezra is still my favourite name, and switching to anything else is going to feel like a downgrade. I‚Äôm going from what is a 10/10 name for me to maybe 8/10 names with Ezri and Erin. ¬†

But I‚Äôm second guessing everything because what if I should just stick it out with Esra and overcome this stupid anxiety that I have about its backwards spelling? Or just go for a super female name like I want to without letting anxiety hold me back? I feel like It‚Äôs so unhealthy to give into the anxiety like this, especially when it‚Äôs over something so irrational that I have no control over, like other people‚Äôs perceptions of me.

Or do I stick with Ezra and overcome the dysphoria, if that‚Äôs even possible? I still feel like the name is neutral. Again, if I switched off it then I feel like I‚Äôd be giving into the anxiety about how some other people see the name as male. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs healthy either

Or do I switch to Ezri / Erin, which avoids the anxiety instead of overcoming it and gets rid of the dysphoria? This option feels the most appealing to me, but again I feel like it‚Äôs unhealthy to give into the anxiety, because I clearly have underlying issues if I care so much about how other people think of my name.

I‚Äôm hesitant to switch to these names because I‚Äôve already gotten so many compliments on the name Esra/Ezra, and while I appreciate those so much and it‚Äôs been great, I worry that switching to Ezri/Erin now will make people think it‚Äôs a downgrade (which i would agree with‚Ä¶) and that worries me.

I feel like these are my four options:

1. Stick it out with Ezra and try to overcome dysphoria (I dont even know if that‚Äôs the right word, just anxiety about ppl seeing it as male ig?)
2. Stick it out with Esra and try to overcome backwards spelling anxiety
3. Switch to Ezri/Erin, settle for a worse name and avoid dysphoria and anxiety
4. Switch to a purely female name and overcome anxiety (extremely anxious about this one, I‚Äôm not sure if i even want to do it of if it‚Äôs even an option)

I feel like I put way too much value into other people‚Äôs perceptions of me. Rationally I know that i shouldn‚Äôt because no one cares anywhere as much as I do, but I don‚Äôt know how to stop :(

So I don‚Äôt really know what to do with regards to names.¬†

If anyone has any advice on how they think I should go about this then please let me know, I would greatly appreciate it. I really needed to get this off my chest because I‚Äôm just so confused and feel like I have issues. Thank you so much for reading till the end :)"	"""I feel like I put way too much value into other people‚Äôs perceptions of me. Rationally I know that i shouldn‚Äôt because no one cares anywhere as much as I do, but I don‚Äôt know how to stop""

You stop by finding a trans & NB friendly therapist that works with anxiety, and you work with them. (Alternatively, join a Group and/or do some anxiety self-help workbooks.)

Honestly, I was going to answer ""you're not gonna like this answer, but you need to get help for your anxiety in general"" before I even saw you state that. Pretty much every paragraph and many sentences have the word ""anxiety"" in it somewhere. That's a lot of anxiety, and while concerns (and yes, some anxiety) about names is a total valid thing, it's definitely being exacerbated by your anxiety in general, and if you can lessen that, I think it'll help you with choosing what to do with the name thing. It'll feel less loaded & you'll feel less trapped."	xevpvw	NonBinary	2	1.0	2022-09-15 12:35:20
Questioning my gender again	"I‚Äôve had intermittent periods of questioning my gender over the past year.  I tried to kill myself last January.  There were a lot of things that went into it.  My life‚Äôs been pretty hard.  I‚Äôve never had a relationship beyond a few one night stands that made me hate myself and it‚Äôs really hard for me to get through school and hold jobs mostly because of the learning disability‚Äôs that come along with my autism.  I‚Äôm lucky enough to be very high functioning and you‚Äôd think that someone who can mostly pass as neurotypical would been able to be more functional at the age of 24.  Anyway what actually triggered the suicide attempt was being convinced that transitioning would finally make me not dead inside and then having doubts that I was actually trans.  I‚Äôm indifferent to having a male body most of the time.  I get kind of uncomfortable with having male genitals during anxiety attacks sometimes but I‚Äôm not totally sure if it‚Äôs dysphoria or just being extremely uncomfortable with my sexuality.  I find masculinity and heterosexuality disgusting but still feel like I have to conform to it since I‚Äôm almost exclusively attracted to women and it seems like most straight women are attracted dominance and masculinity.  I know sexuality varies wildly but the average person tends to conform to heteronormitivity which makes me feel pretty hopeless.  I‚Äôm also intimidated by queer circles.  I was on a date with woman who said that she was suspicious of amab non-binary people who where exclusively attracted to women.  She said there‚Äôs a lot of cis men who pretend to be non-binary so they could get into queer circles and have a bunch of sex.  That confirmed a lot of my fears.  I‚Äôve never cross dressed and the idea of doing it scares me even if I did it alone.  I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not actually trans or just toxic masculinity.  I don‚Äôt particularly care how I present.  It‚Äôs more that I feel like I‚Äôd fit into the social role of a woman better.  Dealing with a misogynistic culture sounds aweful but other parts of it appeal to me.  Also if I was hypothetically born a woman I‚Äôd probably be pretty masculine.  There‚Äôs nothing about my interests that‚Äôs stereotypically feminine.  I listen to a lot of punk and metal and I kind of have edgy teenage boy sensibility‚Äôs.  I guess I‚Äôm just worried that being a masculine lesbian with a male body basically would just make me a dude as far as most people would be concerned.  I‚Äôve heard things about how estrogen changes your sexuality that really appeal to me.  I find myself disgusted by my testosterone based sex drive pretty often.  

Anyway,  I know that was pretty long winded and disorganized.  I‚Äôm typing on a phone so it‚Äôs hard to edit.  I‚Äôd appreciate any attempts to put all this in perspective.  I wrote all this off as really convoluted reaction to being romantically challenged for a while but I‚Äôm reconsidering that now."	"I don't know much about the sexual attraction stuff because I'm ace, but it seems to me like the idea of being a dude makes you unhappy and being not a dude makes you happy, and as far as I know being happier as a specific gender is like one of the biggest signs that you're that gender. Going oh it'd really suck if I wasn't trans and being afraid you're not trans are both very much cisn't things to do so I think all signs point to you're not a guy.
>  I was on a date with woman who said that she was suspicious of amab non-binary people who where exclusively attracted to women.

whoa hey this is a load of garbage and the idea that cismen fraudulently identify as non-binary to enter queer spaces is so miniscule that i think it's unreasonable for someone to have hold this position. maybe its because anecdotally ive never observed that to happen in the 4 years ive identified as queer nor do i ever hear about it talked about in a serious context during that time frame. 

>There‚Äôs nothing about my interests that‚Äôs stereotypically feminine.

i vibe with that. its really difficult to take a lot of interest in heavily gendered topics but still rationalize being nb

> I know sexuality varies wildly but the average person tends to conform to heteronormitivity which makes me feel pretty hopeless.

i know what it feels like to go through this idea and its something i struggle with to this day but the way i deal with this is to think to myself ""fuck that heteronormative bullshit; who i find that makes me happy is special."" just because most people operate under this mode doesnt necessitate that you will not find someone that mutually likes you. 

i think a good idea might be to detach yourself from a world complacent of heteronormativitity and to seek out circles that tend to be really open about nonconformative gender roles. sometimes people feel like that have to be a certain way but if you find a community that lets you act the way you want to you can find a lot of freedom of expression that way. 

there were times in my life where i felt like i could have almost gone full incel/mgtow with my outlook in romance because of a combination of my expression, identity, and interest, but i think there's much to gain from accepting who you are and what you want against what is expected of you.  

there exists groups of gynophile groups online that both do not necessitate male identity nor necessitate femininity as a barrier of entry and i encourage you to seek out these spaces. go out there and live your butch-ass life to the fullest :>
Hey I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve gone through shh a hard time. I‚Äôm glad you are still here üíú

I don‚Äôt know if this will be helpful, but I like to share these links when I can when people talk about doubting if they‚Äôre trans. I experienced a lot of doubt and it was very tough. I sometimes think it can be a more complicated process if you‚Äôre not binary, so many resources are still directed toward binary trans people

Also I agree with the other poster that the woman you were on a date with was wrong. She was definitely being transphobic and also bineristic. 

It‚Äôs really difficult when doubts and stuff come up but it‚Äôs great you‚Äôre reaching out, and these kinds of worries are actually really common.

It‚Äôll get easier with time and it‚Äôs your life and you get to approach this at your own pace, whatever you end up coming to understand about yourself

That‚Äôs good to hear.  I just talked about this in an substance abuse outpatient group I go to and the counselor really reacted to it in a validating way.  When I got home I was considering going on hormones.  I did some research and butch trans lesbians actually do exist which made me feel less like I would just be seen as a dude claiming to be a woman with no outward signifiers.  There‚Äôs some butch transbians on tumbler who really pull it off.  I was still kind of in shock about everything so my mom kept asking me what was wrong.  I eventually told her that I was thinking about going on hormones again and she didn‚Äôt react ideally.  It‚Äôs not that she‚Äôs transphobic or anything,  she just associates it with me becoming self destructive which is what happened last time I questioned my gender.  All the same she asked a bunch of questions that made me feel like I was just a neurotic cis guy who wishes he was a woman because he‚Äôs worried women are threatened by the fact that he‚Äôs male or is fooling himself into thinking he‚Äôs a woman so he can accept the fact that he‚Äôs shy and lacks self confidence.  It felt pretty good entertaining the notion of being a woman but as soon as I started questioning if I was actually trans I started feeling pretty awful.

Body/gender dysphoria? Help??	"Amab - NB. Growing up I always kinda laughed at the idea of gender and my mom once asked me if I felt like I was a boy or a girl because I was a very curious child and was asking about a trans friend of hers as it was a new experience to me, my response was ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm me!‚Äù The thought ended there for a long time because well, I‚Äôm me and usually that‚Äôs fine. More then a decade later I‚Äôm 19 and realize I‚Äôm alloaro and discussing that with a friend and what it means for me and near the end of our talk, he asks if I think there‚Äôs anything to question about my gender to which I say that I‚Äôve never really cared for gender as I am myself. He asked me to look into what that meant for me and so I did shortly after coming to identify as NB. I‚Äôve looked into things but still have a few questions.

Growing up I was always very frail and figured I would like my body more if I appealed to being an ‚Äúattractive man‚Äù. Through my teenage years I worked out and exercised until I fit the view I imagined would please me. Now I have a hard time with how femme clothing fit me and have been thinking I may have preferred to be born female prior to becoming an androgynous NB rather than how things played out. What do you think of this? Should I consider hrt? I‚Äôm not sure that would even have remotely close results to what I‚Äôd want. Is the desire for a thinner frame closer to the desire to transition despite knowing I‚Äôm nb and wanting to be more androgynous, or do you think it‚Äôs closer to gender dysphoria? Also worth asking, what determines the he/they they/she part of pronouns? I don‚Äôt fully understand the reason to distinguish a gender in addition to using the neutral term of they, is it to display which way a person leans, their birth sex, I don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôd like to! 
Ps sorry for the rant"	"[deleted]
Thank you for your input. After reading through your response I feel I may have misunderstood myself and realize now that this is more a thing about my physical body than it is my gender. I am happy with Nb and how that fits me in whole, I think I am just unhappy with my body and thinking that having been afab may have changed this. As far as pronouns go I very much prefer to just be seen as me and similarly to the way you described being kept out of the gendered discussion and being treated as ‚Äúthey‚Äù or ungendered but I am also happy with female pronouns as it provides a small sense of euphoria to be seen as anything but my birth assigned gender. Thank you for your best effort to help me, I appreciate it ;)"	t5whlt	NonBinary	2	1.0	2022-03-03 17:15:00
Questioning myself...can anyone relate to my thoughts?	"&#x200B;

lately I've been questioning my gender. I have identified as female all my life and was afab. But lately the idea of looking androgynous has been really attractive to me, and it's making me question a lot of things. Am I really non binary or am I just gender non conforming?

The idea of being more masculine sounds amazing to me. Sometimes I feel like I wish had a more masculine body and a really nice deep voice and facial hair. If I could have those things, I would totally want them. But at the same time, I like being feminine, too. I like having b00bs, I like feeling like a woman but I feel...embarrassed of it for some reason? Like. I like being a woman well enough but I also kind of love imagining what it would be like if I was a dude, or more masc. I want to have a deep attractive dude voice and a sexy feminine voice at the same time. I want to have a feminine hourglassy figure and a masculine, muscular figure at the same. time. and I can't have both, obviously, but this is why I am questioning if I am NB. I don't think I'm a man. But I sort of want to be a girl with a man body and man clothes and man everything else but also?? ok i have no idea what I'm talking about but hopefully you get it.

She/her pronouns are fine with me. and I'd be comfortable with they/them pronouns and over the internet, many people make the mistake anyway that I am male based on my name, so I've gotten he/him pronouns and they do not make me uncomfortable at all. I know I definitely want to be seen more masculine. I want to be the type of person that looks like a fictional character that girls crush on. But I don't...*not* want to be a woman. And I don't think femininity is bad and I don't dislike being feminine, because other times I want to be seen as...well, a sexy woman in a feminine way that is badass.

I don't want to transition to a man. I know I don't, I just want a foot in the door in both worlds. That's the best way I can think to explain it. I don't have dysphoria for the body I have, really. But I've thought about getting a binder? even though I don't *dislike* my chest at all.

Sometimes, whenever I think ""maybe I'm non binary"" I feel like I'm not really NB I just like the idea of it, so I'm kind of confused. I don't really care about the pronoun thing. It's more of how people see me. I wanna be masc and sort of mistaken as a guy but still physically be a girl? if that makes sense? is that normal??? someone please help

Does this seem any similar to you guy's experiences? (i'm using guys as a gender neutral term here, I'm not sure what other way to phrase it...sorry...) i really need help trying to figure this out."	"you can have and want any body and have any presentation. the only thing I will say is that you seem to have a bioessentialist understanding of bodies. there's no one ""girl's body"" and ""guy's body"". you'll unlearn that the longer you spend in trans spaces.
I'm referring to just a more masculine shape, larger and more square than the wide-hip-thin-waist body that myself and a lot of females have. But thanks for the feedback. I'll try to consider that when thinking about it moving forward. I have not spent much time around trans people so i suppose i do have some learning to do.
yeah I understood what you meant. it's just worth considering that not all people who have builds like that are guys, and not all guys are built like that is all."	kldtr1	NonBinary	2	1.0	2020-12-27 23:14:37
Binary trans first?	"Did anyone come out/identify as binary trans first? 

At the beginning of the year - it seems so long ago - I went on T and came out to friends and family. I was so excited to be on T. 

But the more I started to transition, the more I got nervous about it. Every time I took my shot, I would question it I was doing the right thing. If this was really me. And I also felt like if I kept going with the shots, there‚Äôd be no turning back. So I stopped them.

I‚Äôm AFAB. My mom was always very much ‚ÄúGirls should act like ladies,‚Äù trying to shove me in dresses, indicating women were weaker than men, etc. Very firm gender roles. And I struggled against all of it. I constantly said I wanted to be a boy and refused to wear girly stuff, refused to act dainty, no makeup, took weightlifting in school, etc. Even more, if I put on a dress, I felt like I was ‚Äúcross dressing.‚Äù

At that point, due to some family stories and all sorts of BS, I didn‚Äôt even think being trans was realistic, like a childhood fantasy. But I would often buy clothes in the guys section. My mom awkwardly came to me when I was 20ish (I‚Äôm almost to twice that now) and shoved some makeup at me, ‚ÄúUh. I kind of forgot you were a girl.‚Äù 

Well, now, I‚Äôm suddenly interested in pretty clothes, have flirted with the idea of using makeup, etc. I really don‚Äôt understand. Is it possible I was so against the stifling gender roles that I wasn‚Äôt willing to consider this side of me.

To be clear, I am not now and will not ever be ‚Äúfemale‚Äù or femme or whatever. It‚Äôs so strange because I feel like the idea of gender is kind of bunk. There are different bodies but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø . I also sometimes feel more like a guy, other times, more feminine-ish. And sometimes, I feel like I‚Äôd like to have changes on the ‚Äúlower bits‚Äù but boobs are nice. But my initial decision to finally look into transitioning was partially triggered by spouse buying me some nice bras with shape instead of the one-size-too-small sports bras I normally wear.

Here are some other background things: some of my health issues that I already had have been getting worse, ones that could be affected by testosterone. My youngest son, age 4, has not taken the idea of me transitioning well. He says he wants/needs a mommy. He‚Äôs also adopted via foster care and is pretty much glued to me. There are some things associated with that (respecting his privacy here) that l don‚Äôt want to make worse or hurt him in any way. Also, we homeschool, and I don‚Äôt want to be unable to make friends for either myself or my kids (we have moved to a new area) - it‚Äôs less about being trans and more about being ‚Äúa guy‚Äù.

I do not want to be wishy-washy. I don‚Äôt want to be a ‚Äúspecial snowflake.‚Äù But I so often wish it were easier to be acknowledged as not a woman but not necessarily a guy either. Partially, I feel like, ironically, gender roles and misogyny mean that it is easier for AMABs to get recognition and validation as gender non-conforming - often at a cost to them, unfortunately. 

And I am almost afraid to say I‚Äôm NB to family and friends who have supported me but don‚Äôt really understand. I don‚Äôt want to have my actions make them feel like being trans isn‚Äôt a real thing. 

I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want to seem flaky. I don‚Äôt want people to think I‚Äôm all ‚ÄúLook at me! I‚Äôm special!‚Äù 

I wish I knew what to do and whether I‚Äôm really a transman or not. I mean, I think I have an idea, more and more, I‚Äôm feeling NB but ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

I‚Äôm a dweller. This will constantly be in my head until I figure it out. I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be this angsty because I‚Äôm in my upper thirties. 

Any thoughts?"	you're not hurting anyone by realizing more about yourself. have you considered that you could also just be a GNC guy? it seems like you're worried that you rejected femininity too soon because of gender roles, so I thought I'd mention wanting to wear more feminine things doesn't necessarily mean you're not a guy. that being said, if being nonbinary feels most comfortable to you, welcome to the club my friend! i also really think your kid is going to be okay, fwiw, regardless. most people don't remember most things from when they were 4. you don't have to be a woman for your kid to be alright.	jk3co0	NonBinary	2	1.0	2020-10-29 04:08:45
Guy says he's straight.	"Hi! I am a nonbinary person (they/them). I have not taken hormones to transition but it is something I am interested in, as I do NOT identify as a woman at all.

I started dating a guy who is really great. I explained on our first date that I'm nonbinary and while I look like a woman, I don't identify with that at all.

We've been on quite a few dates now. The guy is really nice, but he's misgendered me a few times by accident which stings. I could get over that, but he's also mentioned a few times that he's straight and that started to bother me. Because I am not a woman.

I told him the problem, and he described himself as VERY straight. But also said...he doesn't care what gender I am, and likes me for me? Which is sweet, but I didn't feel like he was getting it. I explicitly asked him how he would feel if we were seen as two men in public, and the conversation quickly turned to ""You want to transition into a man??"" And ""That's a big life decision have you spoke to a therapist??"" And that really upset me.

I feel like he's okay with me being nonbinary...as long as I look like a girl in public.

Anyone relate to this? Any advice? I really like the guy and want things to work out, but I'm not sure how to get past this."	"So sorry you went through that. And sorry your post seems to have gone for 2 days without getting a reply. I'm a pretty new Enby so I don't want to pretend to be an expert. But I thought you deserved a reply, and some things seem pretty clear to me. 

It would seem to me that if he explodes at the thought of ""being seen as two men"" and is only ok ""as long as you look like a girl in public"" then it seems pretty clear that he doesn't see you as non-binary and is only humoring your identity for the sake of being with the girl he sees in his head. Sorry that you developed such a strong attachment to him. I struggle a lot with severing unhealthy attachments when I get close to people or have a lot of shared history. I recently gutted my social circle because a lot of the people I grew up with turned out to be trumpkin homophobes. I know it's difficult. It's your relationship and I'm only getting a fraction of the scenario. Maybe there's a big enough pro list to justify being invested in maintaining the relationship. But based on your post it sounds like he's not a really great guy."	vorpso	NonBinary	2	1.0	2022-07-01 04:15:03
Am I non-binary?	"So, I was assigned female at birth. Ever since I was a child, I have daydreamed about being a boy. I imagine myself as a boy, but I have no wishes to actually transition.

In real life, I sometimes see myself as a girl, and other times I think of myself as a ""non-girl"" (Idk how else to say it). I did feel a teeny bit dysphoric about my breasts some time ago, but most of the time I don't care. Sometimes - very rarely - I feel that what I look like on the outside, and what I look like on the inside are very different. 


I'm okay with she/her pronouns. I'm actually okay with they/them as well. I just don't want to be called a girl or a woman sometimes, but I don't want to be called a boy/man either, even though I have daydreamed about being one my whole life, starting from my childhood. 

I guess I just don't care? Am I non-binary? Am I thinking too much about it?"		his6lq	NonBinary	2	1.0	2020-06-30 17:44:11
Name change and gender markers	Anyone else in Texas? Everything i can find says theres no way to have a gender designation of anything other than M or F. Im really discouraged because i was hoping to change everything at once and its just not gonna be possible yet. The state currently makes it hard even for binary trans people to change designation and tends to want proof of permanent bodily changes from what im reading?! Im not even sure im planning on taking medical steps and now idk if that's shooting myself in the foot regarding legal transition. I only care case job hunting under my birthname is stressing me out and if i go back to school or get trade certifications id rather it be in my chosen name. Ugh, i honestly wasn't sure how to flare this, ask or rant or support, either way im just feeling really shitty cant fall asleep and wanted to call a 24 hr support line but realized the 24 hr lines were for crisis situations and mine really should wait til normal office hours tp not take away from people who need to call more than me right now. I have diagnosed depression but it not like im feeling any unsafe urges to myself at this exact moment.		ogs0lu	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-07-09 09:27:39
Emotional suppression weirdness	"CW: disassociation, family talk

Anybody else - particularly older (I'm 30) - soo used to emotionally suppressing any divergent desires that you've had to navigate transitioning in an almost numb state and almost get surprised when you have any positive feelings and have difficulty feeling them??

I just came out to my mum. Told myself for years that it wasn't important and I didn't need her to know or be on my side, finally kicked that in the bin because pragmatically speaking its just getting too hard to hide or make my next transitioning move without letting people know. I spent months agonising about doing it, feeling like vomiting and disassociating again, then calmly putting it back on a to do list for another day and telling myself ill work it out later. I'd almost got to thinking I'm like, not really trans because I didn't want my parents to know and treat me differently and got to a point of just feeling like I didn't care if they used my name right. 

But then I finally told her and she was supportive. I just looked in the mirror after disassociating about it for like 4 hours too terrified to look at my messages until I finally got her message back and then realised I'm standing straighter than I usually do and I like what I see in the mirror just a little bit more than I usually do. Danced to some music. I still feel weirdly separate from my feelings but dancing and standing up straighter are usually signs of being happier?

So yeah, it's not unusual for me to have to look at myself like a stranger or analyse my dreams for emotional clues to know if I'm on the right path. Especially with regards to transitioning: I am sometimes a very emotional person, cry at movie and etc - but on the topic of gender I feel like every desire and dream has been flattened by doubt and overthinking. 

Just wondering if anyone else feels (or rather, doesn't feel) in this way. Want to not feel alone I guess as I process a milestone."	"My parents were emotionally abusive so I cut them off eventually, but they spent most of my life ignoring me and punishing me for being different. Before doing so, I had similar agonizing experiences with wanting to tell them things but being physically sick / cptsd flaring up. 

I also have a dissociative emotional process, or at least it used to be a lot worse before I transitioned. I also used dreams to navigate my emotions. 

Your parents sound like they could be more supportive of you, and are willing to do so! That's good at least! That couldn't of been easy to push through all those difficult emotions. I'm proud of you!
Thanks! Well, just one so far, they're split up and I went for the easy one first. Other one is a cop who participated in policing the community in his job back in the day which makes it super awkward at best. But both of them have a lot of guilt for all that happened in my youth which kind of makes it easier now, but it's funny weird how even when you know intellectually it might be fine, the physical rollercoaster still happens!

Thanks for the solidarity anyway. Glad to know I'm not the only one who uses the dreams thing!"	10oud8a	NonBinary	2	0.67	2023-01-30 05:59:50
Gender? I barely know her. Bad title my apologies	I came out as nonbinary sort of before I even really fully accepted that like 2 years ago and then I kind of ignored it again because most days I dont feel gender dysphoria and am comfortable being treated and referred to as my assigned gender even if I feel a bit more androgynous on any given day. I dont look androgynous like at all I have huge tits and am very curvy and everyone can tell I'm afab and that usually doesn't bother me. But it's been like slowly eating away at me that regardless of how I feel unless I fully transition to the other binary gender I dont think any one outside of fellow trans ppl will see me as anything more than Woman Lite. I've been using she/they pronouns but nobody ever really uses they and I'm even  bad at it so I don't feel like I can expect other ppl to do it if I can't. I dont care if ppl I think actually see me use feminine language but I've been thinking about being more adamant about the they them around cis people. I just keep crying at 1am feeling like shit and agonizing over all this as if after so many tears and texts and posts I'll find the answer I'll find the perfect way to express my gender to myself and the world and I can finally be rid of the cognitive dissonance that comes from the differences in the way I see myself versus the way I am perceived by others. I'm starting to accept there isnt an answer much less an easy one. Idk reply if you want with well wishes and support or feedback or solidarity idk just kinda needed to vent. thank you friends for reading this far ‚ù§		ksze9h	NonBinary	2	1.0	2021-01-08 09:48:00
Just venting	"Idk what to call this, a song-poem-rant thing. It dosent come off well as either of the first two so yeah.

Im bigender.
Nonbinary.
I am not trasgender.
But im not anomalous.
Im not special.
Im still as much of a girl as i was ever.
But just because im passing-
Dosent mean i dont need a transition.
My dysphoria is not just apart of my depressive mental condition.

I want short hair.
I'd prefer a flat chest.
i want to look good in a cute dress.
I want combat boots.
And blue lipstick.
Im a nonbiary terror.
A bisexual mess.
I like tough girls.
And soft hearted men.
If she's taller than me then im in the deep end.
I like goth girls.
And geeky guys.
Dont ask me why.
Its just how i fly.
Any other day- 
If i saw them then i might just die.

Oh if shes cute and mean you know im falling not far after.
But id never be able to come clean.
Because she wouldent understand my hang ups and she might be prejudice against my alien mental make up.
I am not a les-bi-an, but im gay and unafraid to say i like a little homoerotic friction.
But if i told he i was a girl and a guy at the same time she'd flip and call me a liar even tho i was forward about being girl all along.
Just because im both dosent mean im lacking in Either.
My body dosent represent who i am-
But i guess thats uninspired.

If i never said a thing and kept quite it hardly would matter.
But as soon as i open my stupid mouth they're out to disprove and tear my tounge out.
""Ive never seen you as masculine my whole life""
""Youre just a tomboy, don't go overboard this time""
""Its all in your head""
""Its just your mind""
""If your fine with being called a girl, why should i care to mind?""
""Youre not a boy so thats not right""
""Stop being a snowflake you dumb left trite""
""You cant be both, thats not gods plight""
And i shut my mouth! And pretend its alright!

After all its the same ither way so why fight?

On pronouns, hormones, and haircuts	"Hey y'all, some classic gender confusion incoming. I just want to get all my thoughts out and hopefully get some external perspectives on this.

Basically I'm 25 and afab, didn't seriously start questioning my gender until about a year ago. I did have the classic pandemic gender crisis where I realized most of gender is a performance while stuck inside for 6 months with no one to perceive me, and I toyed with using she/they pronouns for a while before eventually chickening out because I didn't want to look like I was jumping on a trend (this definitely due to my own issues, it's the same reason I didn't come out as bi for a super long time). Anyways, I started seriously questioning things when I kind of out of no where got really obsessed with the notion of ftm and the process of transitioning. I currently spend a ton of time on the ftm subreddit and searching the tag on tiktok, I think part of me is hoping to find some magical post that 100% lines up with my experiences, so I can just committ to being trans and be done with all this questioning. 

After some introspection I've realized I don't really care about my pronouns, most people default to she/her for me because I present as a cis woman, and I'm cool with that. When I was a kid, esp before puberty I used to get mistaken for a boy a lot and I remember when people would use he/him my mom would get so mad and offended, but I didn't care. I feel neutral either way, I think I'd feel the same about they/them. Thing is I DO feel really uncomfortable with feminine titles. Like, if a stranger calls me miss or ma'am I really hate it, Mr or sir wouldn't bother me though. I'm in a master's program right now and considering whether to commit to the PhD, and one of the things that's a really big pro for me is getting to use the gender neutral Dr. as a prefix.

In my endless scrolling through ftm things online I've come across the concept of low or microdosing testosterone. This is REALLY intriguing to me as someone who's not totally sure of their gender but definitely does not want to be read as a cis woman anymore. I worry, though, that since I'm 25 and would be starting this process pretty late by most trans people's standards, that I should just fully commit and try and make as much progress as I can while I'm still in my 20s. The low/micro dose appeals to me as I dont want to be dealing with an extreme second puberty while in grad school, and I also don't want to deal with coming out that visibly and drastically to the people I know professionally right now. On the flip side, what if I finish this gender journey and realize I'm just a binary trans guy, and I've wasted prescious years of transition time, and now I'll never really pass?

Finally hair, I'm used to dying my hair fun colours and keeping it somewhat long, no shorter than chin length. I've got a weird relationship with my hair because of the aforementioned childhood stuff, I was pretty much forced to cut it off because my mom didn't want to deal with it. But then when people started thinking I was a boy I was forced to grow it out super long again, and get my ears pierced which I didn't want but that was a whole other thing. Anyways, I'm wary of short hair even though I now think I want it and would like the way it looks on me. I'm at the point where I just really need to do something,anything to start reflecting what's going on inside me and a drastic haircut is a great place to start because hair grows back right? Thing is I currently have a split dyed thing going on so I'm trying to wait until my roots are grown out enough that I can chop all the colour off. But the waiting is driving my crazy, to the point where I'm one bad day away from saying fuck it and just shaving my head

anyways, any thoughts comments or suggestions are more than welcome here, I just feel so confused about all of this all the time, it feels a little bit like it's taken over my life. I could go on for hours but these are the main three things I think about, and I just wanted to get it all written down somewhere, and maybe someone with a similar experience will read it"	"For starters, you're not late. For most places this ""being able to transition as a teen"" thing is pretty new. I started medically transitioning at 29 and a year in, I generally get 'sir' at the grocery store (better than the alternative, but still wrong). Honestly the best advice I've ever gotten was, ""don't bank on what future you *might* want."" You don't know how you'll feel in 10 years or even 5. The only thing you can do is be yourself as you are right now. As for hair stuff, as someone who spent many years with hair down to my waist, I highly encourage shaving your head in a fit of ""fuck it, I'm done"" at least once. It's incredibly freeing and really helped me with the ""what if I hate it??"" fear. Now if I chi it up and hate it, the option to buzz it is there"	12h7fqa	NonBinary	1	1.0	2023-04-10 04:46:31
Describing Sexuality	"Hello! I hope you're all doing well and are healthy. 

I came here to ask about how enbies describe their sexuality to others, since I know a lot of sexualities seem to focus on the relationship between sexes (i.e. heterosexual is the attraction to the opposite sex). 

I'm a creative writer and in my current project, one of my characters come from a society where non-binary/genderfluidity is the norm. This character best fits the demimale description, as he only feels partially attached to his gender and also doesn't desire to transition to other genders. 

Because of this, I'm unsure how to describe his sexuality. He's attracted to women and femininity in the most broad sense. He doesn't care about chromosomes, genitals or how you express your femininity. If you identify yourself in a feminine lens, (femme enbies, MtF, butch femmes, tomboys etc) he will be attracted to you. 

I'm not sure what else to call this besides gynephilia/gynesexual? It seems to fit the criteria the most, but after reading some GSRM discourse about it, I'm not sure if it's the best fit. 

What do you think? How do you explain your sexuality?"	"for him it'd probably just be easiest to say ""I like feminine people"". if he's from a world where being nonbinary is the norm, then that society would probably have a different paradigm for how they describe sexuality. they might not even define themselves by what genders they're attracted to at all! maybe they define it simply by whether they're a top/bottom/vers, as the ancient Romans did. or maybe they don't define themselves by their sexual attraction at all, just like generally I don't define myself by the fact that in retrospect all of my close friends have been brunettes. does that make sense?
yeah, that makes sense! I like that idea, ty!"	n9cg7p	NonBinary	1	1.0	2021-05-10 18:34:29
I'm hoping ya'll can help me understand. (Xpost from r/NoStupidQuestions)	"I was sent here by a kind soul in r/nostupidquestions, and was hoping for insight from people who identify as non binary. 

I am not trying to insult anyone, the logical side of my brain just does not understand. 

To me, there are males and females. There are distinct biological and physical differences. Then there are transgender people. The discription is right there in the word, it's sombody transitioning from one gender to the other. (I've been informed that trans is a Latin prefix and does not mean transitioning, but the idea remains the same)

Most of the people I have asked have had the knee jerk reaction of ""Just accept it! They're people too!"" Nobody has been able to give me an answer I can understand however. (Note: I have only talked to people who are supportive, not anybody who falls into another category. I know one friend of a friend who identifies as them, but they have been busy with a new job, so I have not had the chance to ask)

I like to think of myself as a fairly open minded person. I don't care who you are or how you live your life, at the end of the day, it has no effect on me. I'm just tired of feeling like an asshole because I can't wrap my head around the concept. "	"First of all, as a nonbinary person I appreciate people like you who are genuinely curious and not judgemental :)

For me, it is an overpowering lifelong feeling of being a ""hybrid"" between male and female. I am biologically female, and like my softer facial features, lack of facial hair, and moderate pitched voice, but have always been uncomfortable with my boobs and wished my body frame were more masculine. I look like an adult tomboy, and dress pretty much like a man but do not live as one because I don't feel like a man either. But I really really don't feel like a woman. I'm a hybrid.

So in a sense it's like there is no win for people like me. I don't mean that in a depressing way, my life is amazing! I wouldn't be who I am without this. But it also adds difficulties especially in the contexts of society that wants you to ""pick one already!""

Hope that's helpful! Let me know if I have generated questions ;)
Hey, I identify as NB and I totally understand your confusion. So for me, I recognized that I am biologically female. I have tits and a vagina, but I don't feel comfortable being called a female because I do not associate with traditionally ""female"" gender roles or various other ""female"" things. However at the same time I don't necessarily associate with the ""male"" side of the spectrum either. The key to understanding gender is realizing that it is on a spectrum and it is a unique experience to each individual, there are even languages in which gender does not exist and there is pronoun for humans and a pronoun for things. Sex, on the other hand its a more definite thing, XX, XY etc. Please let me know if I can clarify anything in a better way!
It is also important to know that biologically, you can be neither male (XY) or female (XX). Here is an article from the World Health Organization about sex chromosomes (there are several) and how societies develop genders seperate from them. Also, not all current societies adhere to a binary (male and female only). Some recognize multiple genders. I recommend you give it a read. 

http://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/index1.html
we don't identify. we are.
hi! firstly, ‚Äútransgendered‚Äù is incorrect grammar! ‚Äútransgender‚Äù is an adjective, not a verb or a noun.  secondly, i believe your issue with understanding is the fact that gender and sex are not the same thing. sex is your biological characteristics (genitals, hormones, chromosomes) while gender is how you identify mentally. there have been studies proving this difference (though i cannot provide links at the moment, i‚Äôm typing in a hurry and do not have time to find them). nonbinary people exist because gender, as a mental identity, is not fixed on male and female. it is, rather, a very fluid idea that is very individual to every person that experiences it. i hope this helps at least a little bit.
its like everyone tells you your whole life that you're a boy and that feels deeply profoundly wrong so you think you might be a girl but that feels very wrong too and so you hear about people who have carved out a space for themselves somewhere in the middle or off to the side and feel a deep sense of relief because neither option is true and you can take what you want from masculinity and femininity and understand yourself the way you want to. its like what if she and he both make me a little nauseous. what if i want a beard and to wear heels. what if i am not a woman or a man. what if i feel like the other in both kinds of single sex groups. our limited concept of gender is a lie. its a way of acknowledging that you can describe yourself and your body somewhere else than within the place that already exists. its like you know other people are seeing you one  way or the other and in an ideal world they would have no idea and be okay with that. 
As you‚Äôve learned from the other commenters, gender is how you feel (your mental conception of yourself) while biological sex is a constellation of physical characteristics. Gender does not flow from ones biological sex, which should be pretty evident even from the experiences of binary trans people.  

For trans people, whether binary or nonbinary, one‚Äôs gender (the internal mental sense) does not match the gender they are assigned by others on the basis of their biological sex characteristics or gender expression.  For binary trans people, that internal sense of gender is of being a man or a woman. 

For nonbinary people, that internal sense of gender is not just that of always being a man or always a woman. Nonbinary people are varied in their sense of gender, since nonbinary is an umbrella category. Some nonbinary people are inbetween the two binary genders. Some are genderfluid and move between genders. Some feel a lack of gender (lack of gendered sense of self). Some encompass being male and female genders, or multiple genders, at the same time. And there are even more expansive nonbinary genders. 

I think a lot of people struggle to understand how another person can have an internal sense of gender that isn‚Äôt consistent with how others would gender them from an external view of them (an external view that is rooted in evaluation of physical sexism characteristics and gender expression stereotypes).  This is the heart of transphobia. Even binary trans people face it before they transition or if they cannot transition. Ultimately, it comes from believing that your external view of a person‚Äôs gender and society‚Äôs view of their gender should trump their internal sense of their gender, especially if they take no steps to externalize that internal sense. But they ARE externalizing it: they are telling you their gender, and that‚Äôs ultimately what we should respect as the ultimate arbiter of their gender.  Gender is, after all, a sense of self. 
Now that you understand the difference between sex and gender, you may enjoy https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/01/brain-sex-many-ways-to-be-male-and-female

> Most differences between females and males are small, but this study looked only at the largest differences (for example, worries about weight was the personal attribute showing the largest difference, with about 80% chance of correctly guessing someone‚Äôs sex on the basis of being above or below average concern; while for sex-stereotyped activities, the largest difference was in the use of cosmetics, for which the chance of guessing sex on the basis of their use was above 90%). Even looking only at such behaviours, between 55% and 70% of people had a ‚Äúmosaic‚Äù of gender characteristics, compared to less than one per cent who had only ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù or only ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù characteristics. 

Most people's brains are neither purely male nor purely female. Seeing it as a spectrum is still wildly oversimplified, but closer to the truth. Some people have genders that more or less fit under the label ""male"" or ""female""; some don't.

""Transgender"" is an umbrella term, which includes many non-binary people and doesn't imply transitioning.
My biggest misconception was the definition of gender. I understood the hybrid feeling, I just couldn't wrap my head around what I perceived to be biological fact. I know better now, and your appreciation makes me smile. 
I like the spectrum analogy, that makes sense to me.  I've always considered sexuality to be a spectrum, so that helps. 

While I can accept that, I have a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of gender roles. To me, that's the idea of men hunt, women cook, boys play with cars, girls play with dolls. Don't get me wrong, I abhor those stereotypes. I'm coming to realize that my lack of understanding stems from not connecting roles with gender. Therefore, however wrong I may be, it translates to a psychological issue where I have always considered gender to be biological. 
Fixed! My apologies, I have to admit I'm not as up on my terminology as I would like to be, and my basic grammer skills are a bit rusty. 

I will admit, I have a hard time separating gender and sex. Up until your reply, I did not realize there were scientific differences, I will have to do some research. If I can read up on the science side of things, that will help my logical side immensely. 

Thanks!
Thanks to u/greyscale101, I just learned that there is a legitimate difference between gender and biological sex. That helps a lot. I understood the mental aspect of not fitting into the black and white definitions (I've experienced it myself in regards to my sexuality, after a few years of experimentation, I decided that I land in the straight category, though not squarely). It's been hard for me to dissociate between gender and sex, as I spent my entire life with them being synonymous. Thanks for the input!
Thank you for putting so much effort into your response. I appreciate it. 

You mentioned that some people encompass multiple genders, and I interpreted that at both male and female at once. Am I correct in that?
I'll give it a read! Also, did not know Transgender was an umbrella term. Some of the articles I have read make much more sense now...
In response to that, I would encourage you to think about the fact that the gender roles that exist are merely imposed on us as a societal standard and there are plenty of examples that prove that.
hopefully someone will be able to comment with some links to help you ou. sorry i‚Äôm not able to help more.
Sometimes, but other people are a combination of other genders like a binary gender (male or female) plus  some non-binary gender (for example, somewhere in the middle of the spectrum, androgyne, agender/neutrois). 
I agree with you. I'm learning that gender and biological sex are different, which means that gender roles as a societal construct are in fact related to gender, and not just stereotypes. Changing my definition of gender goes a long way toward understanding. 
It's all good, I'm pretty handy with the google
Great! I know it will take some getting used to, but as long as you make a conscious effort, you should be set!
No effort needed actually. The separation of gender and sex makes all the difference!

Making Changes	"So I'm new to this subreddit, I'm not really much of a reddit person. I'm nonbinary, specifically genderfluid existing in the demi-girl/agender areas (they/them), and I'm finally seeking and receiving transgender care. I just started T and I'm in the process of getting sterilization procedures approved. For the T, I'm injecting 100mg every 4 weeks, I did my first injection 2 weeks ago. I'm starting to see some changes (exciting!) but it's oily skin (boo!). I want to maintain my skin being soft, or as soft as it can be, because I still am pretty fem presenting, while being GNC. Any advice for how to adjust my skincare while on T? 

Feel free to ask me any questions about my transition goals, gender identity, gender presentation, or really any other questions you may have. 

Tl;dr I just started T and I want to try and keep my skin soft. Advice needed."		khdp48	NonBinary	1	1.0	2020-12-21 09:03:19
Feeling dysphoric and anxious about my relationship.	"(AFAB androgyne) Gonna leave a lot of context behind, but still... I've had issues with my identity lately, starting with my transphobic bestfriend. I didn't feel the need to be recognized as androgyne before, but his critics enhanced my urge to present androgynously, and I've been feeling more dysphoric. I also recently got an apartment for University, sharing it with 3 student girls. Only one of them knows, but they all call me by my (current, still trying to find the one) chosen name, unlike my old friends, boyfriend and family, who can't seem to pick up the new habit. But I've been feeling very invalid and urging for androgynous recognition. It all makes me very socially uncomfortable. For a variety of female traits I have, I know everyone perceives me as a girl, even those I came out to - mostly because I just don't _look_ androgynous at all. I use a lot of make up, I'm way too curvy because of fat, I tend to enhance my chest because it's part of my gender identity, and I wear jewelry although it's usually unisex. And I'm also short. This all is just me being myself, whether it fits my identity or not, because you know, your looks shouldn't be based on your gender but just on what you like. Y'all beautiful people know that. But I know it makes it impossible for people to see me as non-binary, or at least to not see me as a woman - and there's a lot of pressure and expectations about looking androgynous, you know that too. So, I thought presenting aesthetically androgynous could help me feel okay, even if it might not be my truest look. But my body immediately gives it away. My chest is probably the easiest part to hide, and I'm getting to the point that it makes me dysphoric despite it being part of my ideal body. Until a few weeks ago, my chest wasn't big enough. Now from time to time I happen to not want it at all, just because it exposes me so much. I hate this.

So yesterday I ended up experiencing so much dysphoria I had a panic attack upon dressing up for a dinner out with roommates. I so wanted a binder or anything that could hide my chest, and I realized I would probably feel a lot better socially if I could wear one when I don't feel androgynous enough. But I don't even have the money and asking my family for one (I don't have a job) is a big no.

...So I ended up going overboard with my significant other.

Tomorrow it's our anniversary, and I had asked him for a watch as a gift. Because we hadn't found one yet and it was a very random gift, I tried asking him if he would be okay with buying me a binder instead. He said not really, that it was too much for him, and apologised for not managing to support me fully. I knew it could happen, I was very hesitant and careful asking him, and I was okay if he refused. But for some reason, it hurt me so much I'm still trying to cry it out. I just don't know what to think of the fact that he doesn't want to go all the way helping me being who I wanna be. I don't think he can't love me without supporting me fully, I know it's not black and white, but what should I make of his reluctance?...

I know this probably won't cause any further problems either. I know my identity won't separate us or burn his love away. I know this doesn't make him love me less, nor it means he doesn't accept me. I know he's doing his best and I don't blame him at all. I know he just doesn't feel like participating to my transition by giving me clothes, but he's okay if I do. I know his only issue is the idea that I might ultimately erase my chest - because he loves my body - or progressively transition to something visibly non-female - because he just isn't attracted to it. I know none of that is gonna happen either anyway - so he will be fine, we will be fine. I know my gender identity isn't a threat to us. But seriously, _fuck this feeling_. He's my only one. I love him more than anything, and I'm the happiest I've ever been since he is by my side. I can't risk losing him because of some fucked up social anxiety. I can't risk going on with the idea that he doesn't really love me or see me or accept me for who I am and then I fuck everything up because I never trust anybody. I can't risk that fear eats me and my love for him away slowly. But I can't just ignore this social anxiety and dysphoria I get and deny the things that would make me feel better. I can't stay defenceless in front of my problems when I could use such powerful weapons. I don't know if there is a way to keep both safe healthily. I hate that my gender identity is causing me this when my realization felt like the most liberating thing ever. It took so much insecurity and anxiety off me, and now it's a source of it. And now also a source of potential harm for my relationship? Fuck this. I feel like I'm not what he really wants.

(Please don't blame my boyfriend. He's really doing the best he can, and I know he really loves me and cares for me. I would never exchange him with anything.)"	"Not blaming your boyfriend but you could be with someone who supports you wholeheartedly. Dysphoria is a lot and you need support. If binding is going to make you feel better then do it. Do it for you and only you always dude. No one else matter, it‚Äôs your life and your should be happy. If your partner can‚Äôt support you then that‚Äôs a major red flag. Just like your family and friends who kept the bad habit of using the wrong name
I don't feel like he really can't support me, tho. He wouldn't have a problem with me wearing a binder when we're out, or presenting masculine. I think he just doesn't feel ready to commit to me socially transitioning, as he wouldn't normally be attracted to my gender. It's just the act of buying me one himself (for our anniversary too) that makes him uncomfortable. He really is a loving partner, he's actually the best thing that ever happened to me. He's never had a problem with the LGBTQ community either. He's not prejudiced or anything. Personally I think his reaction is quite normal for an hetero cis man who has never had an LGBTQ partner (friend either?) before. He hasn't known for long either, and he's just still wrapping his mind around the fact that I am not 100% a woman. But really, he is the most caring partner on Earth. He does anything for me. He's really sorry that he can't commit to this, he really knows how important it is. He's just doing his best like everyone, and I think the love we have for each other will be enough to get through it. It's just a little more complicated now.
If your partner can‚Äôt support you as the person you are, even if it‚Äôs new or different, they aren‚Äôt the person for you. This reaction isn‚Äôt normal. Partners should support you if they really love you for the person you are. This person might do everything for you now but they probably want to keep seeing you as more female presenting. Especially since you say that they‚Äôre cis hetro, they don‚Äôt see you as androgynous. I‚Äôd be reevaluating your relationship, red flags all  around
But I mean, I don't feel like my preferred gender presentation _isn't_ feminine, not at all. I do love my chest, and my ideal body is still pretty feminine, chest included. I love to expose it, and I love being sexy in a feminine way. What makes me uncomfortable is that this keeps people from perceiving me as androgyne, and I feel like I'm forced to present more androgynous in order to get the right idea through and receive the right feedback. It's the only reason why I want to hide my tits. But I also really know that's not what I feel like deep inside. It doesn't fit my aesthetics and ideal presentation. It's more of a show I put up rather than a real expression of myself. Just as an example, my tits are growing bigger lately, and I've been super happy about it, even if it gives my sex off. And he knows. So I don't feel like he's not supporting _me_, cause a male chest just isn't what I _am_ and he knows. What he sees when we are alone is what I really am, and he loves that and accepts that. I don't feel like his inability to support this show I put up mines his support for _me_.

Plus, he _reeeally_ loves my chest too. I just can really see why he'd be uncomfortable helping me erase it. I don't think this really counts as a red flag, honestly. As for him seeing me as a woman, yes, it's probably true. But I'm really okay with it, because the social aspect of my gender doesn't harm me half as much as the physical aspects. Most of it is about genitalia for me, and my female side is still definitely predominant, especially in a sexual/romantic way, so I don't mind him perceiving me as mostly female. He loves me for reasons that go beyond gender, and I know he won't stop just because I'm not his preferred one. But me having a different body, a different sex and genitalia, is something that would upset him like it would upset any monosexual person. Unfortunately the surgeries I would like to get (which are really the only thing I'd change) are not practicable, so I can't really transition. But if I did, it wouldn't be comfortable for him, it never could. It's okay, and it's normal. He can't actively support me transitioning into a gender that he doesn't like. He's not a bad choice or partner because of this. Everyone has their own limits.
In the end you‚Äôre going to do what you think is best but partners who really love someone accepts their partner in ever form, your situation sounds toxic and unhealthy. Just be careful
Oh god I really think you're exaggerating now. Thank you for the advice and for caring, but you're reading too much into this. He really is a good partner.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm reading into anything. I legit can only read what you typed out and from what you said. You even stated that he won‚Äôt be able to fully support you or that he apologized for not being able to support you and that upset you enough that you were crying. Your partner told you that you couldn‚Äôt do something that will alleviate dysphoria and make your life a more positive experience and you‚Äôre not doing it because ‚Äúit‚Äôd be too much for your cis hetro boyfriend‚Äù Your partner doesn‚Äôt support you and can‚Äôt even compromise it seems and it‚Äôs screaming red flag.
>Your partner told you that you couldn‚Äôt do something that will alleviate dysphoria

Yes, you literally read everything wrong. I already stated he's fine with me wearing a binder, he just doesn't feel comfortable being the one who buys it. He's not keeping me from doing anything, he's not prohibiting me to buy or wear one myself, he's not going against my happiness nor freedom nor wishes, he's just not willing to actively contribute to this. He isn't going to love me less for wanting or wearing it, but being hetero literally means that you cannot be attracted to other than your opposite sex. It's not something one should be considered ""toxic"" for, it just is _not_ toxic. He has the right to be uncomfortable with it.

He didn't even say he _wouldn't_ buy. I asked him if he was hypothetically emotionally okay with buying it, and he said ""not completely"". If I had actually asked him to, he would have. All he said is he wouldn't be totally comfortable buying it.

Of course I cried. I had just gotten out of a one hour panic attack from dysphoria because I felt people didn't see me as androgyne. I was emotional and going through a depressive borderline moment. I was already crying. The reason it hurt me is that it meant he can't see me as androgynously as I really am, not that I felt like he can't support me, cause _he does_. All the time. The fact that he cannot see that part of me doesn't even matter, because it's not about social gender to me. He does more than he should for me, and he has all the right to be forgiven one limit.

Not committing actively doesn't mean not supporting. He has boundaries just like I do. Being sexually uncomfortable with a partner who has a different sex than your preferred one isn't toxic. It's literally how attraction works. That doesn't mean they love someone any less. It doesn't mean they can't support within their limits. The fact that he is sorry and apologizes for not _committing to it_ is literally the sign that he recognizes his limits, knows they are not okay, is not letting them affect his feelings, and wishes he could support me more. There isn't even the tiniest need for a compromise here. I want something, he just doesn't want to _buy it for me_ - the compromise is I buy it myself which he is completely fine with. I don't even need to start compromising, cause he's _letting me_ do what I want and need. 

Having literally just one limit to one's relationship isn't the same as creating a toxic or unhealthy environment _at all_. Like not even by far. Relationships aren't perfect, mate, _people_ are not perfect. Doing one's best is more than enough. I don't know what you expect from a SO, but even unconditional love, if it really exists, has issues. What's toxic is backing up because someone isn't 100% the perfect angel you want.

Having said that, I'm not going to keep hearing someone who doesn't even know my partner spit shit on him and our relationship. Bye.
I don‚Äôt think I read it wrong. Your original post points out toxic behavior from your partner. I might have misunderstood what you wrote from the wording. But the phrasing of your posts definitely made it seem like your cis hetro partner doesn‚Äôt want you to be yourself. You even stated ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know what to think of the fact that he doesn‚Äôt want to go all the way helping me being who I wanna be‚Äù ‚ÄúI know his only issue is the idea that I might ultimately erase my chest- bra cause he loves my body-or progressively transition to something non female because he just isn‚Äôt attracted to it‚Äù dude wake up, he‚Äôs basically telling you that he wants you to stay female presenting or he won‚Äôt be attracted to you. He literally is saying if you start presenting different or get top surgery he won‚ÄòT be attracted to you. That isn‚Äôt a relationship, perfect or not, this is your cis heterosexual boyfriend trying to tell you he won‚Äôt be attracted to you if you start transitioning and that he won‚Äôt support you if you start doing things that are good for your mental health. You should definitely be talking to him about your gender identify not trying to please him. He setttign boundaries and you‚Äôre not setting your own. You might think your relationship is great but as a person on the outside this situation screams red flags. I hope you figure it out. Good luck"	ta6kau	NonBinary	1	0.67	2022-03-09 12:17:41
Misgendering and History	"Hi, I (19M) have a question, and it‚Äôs pretty personal.

Years ago I had a huge crush on someone who was not out to me yet as non-binary while I had a crush on them. I would talk about them constantly, to the extent that using the word ‚Äúshe‚Äù or ‚Äúher‚Äù became an epithet for that one person. Of course, unbeknownst to most of us at the time, those were the wrong pronouns.

When they came out to me I immediately switched - this is someone who I cared about a lot and I wanted them to know that I was going to be fully supportive. I changed their name on my phone. That year, I had written notes to a bunch of my friends who were graduating - I gave them a second note with the right pronouns. 

Yet their transition is a huge part of my life too, because it explained why things were rocky between us for years. The joke I make essentially goes ‚ÄúI thought I loved a girl, and most people told me I didn‚Äôt love her. They were right, but their inflection was wrong. It wasn‚Äôt the love, it was the her.‚Äù 

In that sentence, though, lies my question. It is a huge part of my life story that I liked someone who I was absolutely certain was the ‚Äúgirl‚Äù of my dreams. When I write about my experience today, it makes me very uncomfortable because I don‚Äôt want to misgender them, yet they-series pronouns simply do not reflect what I was actually experiencing back then. 

I‚Äôve worked on a story about this time in my life for a long time, and the way I‚Äôve worked around this is that I don‚Äôt use their dead name at all, only naming them for the first time on the day they came out to me. To refer to them prior to that, I only use she-series pronouns, and no female is addressed with pronouns at all. The idea is to make the pronoun speak very directly as a literary epithet, instead of the actual female ‚Äúshe‚Äù. By not using their name, I‚Äôm removing the identity of femininity from them. 

Is this still misgendering? I want to try to be as supportive as I can. Thanks for hearing the story."	"The best thing to do in this situation is to ask your friend, because the answer is going to vary widely from person to person. Some people are comfortable using different pronouns when talking about their past (or may even prefer it), while for many others this would be extremely uncomfortable.
 Seconding the fellow commenter on ""ask your friend"". And as for a proposal alternatively/in addition to their current epithet- maybe a wording along the lines of ""(who I thought was) she""?
So I don't actually use the word ""she"" in conversations at all anymore, even when referring to the past. This is only specific to my own written history of the events that took place, where the gender becomes relevant - for example, ""I wanted to ask her to prom."" The pronouns are used literally hundreds of times in the telling of the story in ways like this. If I use 'they' there or even put quotes around 'her' or any other such qualifier, it gives the reality away before the story is complete.
 I'm going to be honest, I'm not sure how I personally feel about their identity as a nonbinary person being a 'big twist ending' in a cis-written narrative; even with good intentions (and I think you have them), it's striking a bit too close to some historically uncomfortable tropes about trans deception/trans people's transitions being plot twists in cis people's narratives. 

 Again, I am not your friend, so I'd suggest asking them if they are comfortable with this story or not- they are the ultimate judge of if they feel that this is misgendering/uncomfortable. I do wish you luck.
I completely understand, that's why I asked. Thanks."	icvf9i	NonBinary	1	0.67	2020-08-19 20:13:44
Am I non-binary?	"I've lived most of my life as a (feminine) male, and at around age 22 began transition towards (trans) womanhood. In the last year, I had various experiences (physically & spiritually) that mandated me stopping hormone therapy,.

By physically, I mean that I was likely facing adverse effects of long term hormone therapy (using Estradiol patches & cyproterone acetate pills), and gaining weight from it and experiencing other concerning health changes.

By spiritually, I got to a point where I was wondering if I'd make it, and had to reckon with the faith I left years before (christianity), and that began a journey back to reading & following biblical teachings, which has meant making a number of changes in my lifestyle, including ceasing my MtF transition and realizing that God doesn't make mistakes, and that I'd honor Him by honoring what he naturally blessed me with.

Fast forward to now, I'm back to using phytoestrogens and progesterone cream (which are more mild/less dangerous) because I don't want the male physical patterns of aging that I see take hold over time.

I've realized that I don't really want all the upkeep of being female (because tbh it's so involving and draining, caring about wearing certain clothes, the approval of (men's) gaze, comparison to other women, etc etc.

I also don't want to be one the other extreme of being a 'dude' or 'man'. That's just not been me, ever. It's not me.

I'm somewhere in the middle. I like to dress very neutrally, in sweatpants, hoodies, turtle necks, beanies, etc. so I'm not sending out either feminine or masculine vibes. Plus, I like walking out this way knowing that I'm not clawing through the male or female hierarchy/food chain, where certain appearance markers merit more approval points. Being outside of this matrix of presentation is freeing for me.

I still like guys, though, if I could be asexual, that would be awesome, both bc I find physical attraction/desire in general a form of carnality that causes poor judgement/narrow-minded thinking, and bc, in christianity, lust and same-sex attraction are sins.

So, back to gender presentation, or lack thereof. Idk. Do you think that being in this 'neutral' space in between (at least at this stage in my life) means that I'm functionally non-binary?

And btw, I recognize that my gender dysphoria from an early was likely due to a phsychological misallignment/miswiring that led to a skewed interpretation of my own gender. If that's triggering to someone, I'm sorry. Even Blair White, a wellknown trans female personality, admits that her own dysphoria is likely rooted in a mental problem."		n0q2wj	NonBinary	1	1.0	2021-04-28 22:06:35
Came out to my wife, in a way. Still somewhat confused. Non-conformity, sexuality, label confusion, and self-acceptance	"Covid lockdown has been a wild ride. I‚Äôm 27M (assigned male at birth), married to a wonderful (cis) woman who I‚Äôve been with since high school. I have always self-identified and presented as a man my entire life. From the outside, things probably look about as ‚Äúideal‚Äù and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù as they can be, as far as societal norms go. We both have solid careers going, we have a house, we have a baby on the way, we‚Äôre about as fortunate and privileged as you can be at our age and I feel so lucky to be where I am in life with her by my side. I wanted to lay out this background because my story deals with societal norms and expectations, and I think this background context is an important part of where I‚Äôm coming from. Now, I want to write out a sort of journey I‚Äôve recently undergone on a much more internal level, so here goes:

Starting a few years ago, I started to develop certain kinks that maybe hinted at some suppressed urges I had, but they were overall relatively tame and I didn‚Äôt really think too much about them when I wasn‚Äôt actively engaging in these kinks. (Really this was just limited to some light cross-dressing, wearing panties, and experimenting with penetration). I would always do these things in private, not involving my wife, because I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I had to literally force myself to admit to my wife that I ordered myself a toy because I figured she‚Äôd likely see the credit card bill or find it eventually. It was so hard to admit it to her but I eventually did, and she was very neutral about it. Very much a ‚Äúdo what you want, I don‚Äôt care‚Äù kind of vibe.

My wife and I have an incredible sex life, but as I‚Äôm sure is true of most relationships, there are some challenges that we‚Äôre working through together. She has a good deal of anxiety when it comes to initiating sex, and puts pressure on herself to perform, no matter how much I tell her I just want her to feel comfortable and that I crave intimacy, not sexual gratification. When we do break through that initial barrier, our sex is passionate and incredible. I would definitely call it somewhat ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù in the grand scheme of things, but it feels really good, and we connect with each other emotionally in a way that I know I absolutely crave. Like, in the heat of the moment, I almost start to disassociate from myself, and instead start feeling like she and I are merging into one. It‚Äôs really hard to describe, but I absolutely love it, and I‚Äôm mentioning it here because I want to refer back to it a little later on.

Now, let me change gears to my more private, personal sexuality. My wife works long night shifts, which means that for a couple days of the week, she‚Äôs at work when I‚Äôm at home alone for a good 6-8 hours before I go to sleep. On some occasions, I take advantage of this alone time to really engage in what I‚Äôd call an ‚Äúaltered sexuality‚Äù. I feel differently about myself when I put on my wife‚Äôs lingerie than when I do when she is around. I still identify as the same person, with the same personality, but there‚Äôs a freedom to do what I want with no judgement that is thrilling. This thrill is very tightly coupled with arousal, which is why I‚Äôm describing this as an ‚Äúaltered sexuality‚Äù specifically. When I ‚Äúfinish up‚Äù, without getting too graphic, I put the lingerie away, I put on my normal clothes, I go back to my usual activities and way of thinking and feeling. I liked that it could be discrete, that I could hide all of the evidence before my wife got home, and nobody had to know about this embarrassing part of my sexuality.

So this pattern continued over the course of several years. With covid, the frequency increased, since I‚Äôm all locked down and working from home, but my wife is an essential worker who is still going out for her night shift job several times a week. Over the last week or so, the intensity of this sexuality felt like it increased, or maybe I was paying more attention to it, or letting it be more free or something. One evening about a week ago, while my wife was at work, I had a sudden, crazy idea - ‚Äúwhat if I just shaved my legs?‚Äù. After all, it‚Äôs covid, nobody is going to see my uncovered legs for weeks, it sounds really exciting, why shouldn‚Äôt I? I knew I obviously couldn‚Äôt hide such a thing from my wife, so I texted her and said something along the lines of ‚Äúfor some reason, I want to try shaving my legs, I don‚Äôt know why but I think I‚Äôm gonna do it‚Äù. 

Her response was basically what I expected - similar to when I told her about ordering myself that toy, she basically said ‚Äúok, do whatever you want, doesn‚Äôt bother me‚Äù. So, I did it. As soon as I started, I felt the same kind of thrill that I felt the very first time I ever put on panties. It was this incredible sexual excitement and arousal. This felt like the next level of this ‚Äòaltered sexuality‚Äô pattern that I‚Äôve been engaging in. The only difference was that this time, I couldn‚Äôt hide all of the evidence when I was done. I couldn‚Äôt just put everything away and go back to my ‚Äúnormal self‚Äù, because my legs were still shaved! I had to live with them, and the crazy thing was, I liked that idea.

I started to look at and appreciate my legs in a non-sexual context. I liked how they looked and felt, not because it made me feel naughty and sexual, but because it made me feel like me, and I could actually look at part of my body and be proud of how it looked. This definitely felt like a revelation of sorts, but it was also scary too. I didn‚Äôt know what this was. Could I still call myself and think of myself as a man if I preferred my legs to be smooth and silky? What would my friends and family think of me if they found out I did this and liked it? I decided I had to do some research on reddit, since that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm often inclined to do when I want to know more about something new.

Now, I‚Äôm still not really sure if going to reddit right away was a good idea. I stumbled across subreddits like this one and was seeing an entire world of people, terms, and ideas that I didn‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôve always identified as an ‚Äúally‚Äù, I‚Äôve always tried very hard to stay educated and accepting of all types of people, but I admit I wasn‚Äôt aware that there was so much variety and terminology. I really wanted to find a ‚Äòdiagnosis‚Äô for what I was going through. I came across some post or description of the term ‚Äúgenderfluid‚Äù and thought that maybe that‚Äôs what I was dealing with. After all, the word itself sounded like it could fit since I was sort of sliding into femininity with shaving my legs. But, after deciding that maybe I was genderfluid, I read another post that described genderfluid people as non-cis, and that if you aren‚Äôt cis, then you‚Äôre trans, by definition.

To be fully honest, this kinda terrified me. I don‚Äôt want to be trans, it doesn‚Äôt feel right to think of myself in that way. I think trans people are incredible, I think they‚Äôre some of the bravest, most courageous people on this planet, but I can‚Äôt think of myself in that group, or with that label. I know about other trans people who have described the trans experience, and I just don‚Äôt connect with what they‚Äôve described at all. I don‚Äôt suffer from dysphoria, I‚Äôve never wanted different pronouns or a different name than the masculine ones I use today, I don‚Äôt want to be a wife instead of a husband -- I am excited to be a father and a dad. But, I‚Äôm such a sucker for definitions and diagnosis that I thought ‚Äúwell shit, if liking my shaved legs makes me genderfluid, and being genderfluid makes me trans, then I guess that‚Äôs what I am even if it feels wrong to think of myself in that way‚Äù.

Another day or two went by and I was still grappling with this stuff in my mind. My wife, meanwhile, knew about the shaven legs, seemed totally fine with it, if not super excited by it. I started to work on a letter, in the mornings when she was still sleeping, because I knew that no matter what I was going through, I wanted to find a way to tell her. I wanted her help in figuring out what this was. So I worked on this letter over two different mornings, basically going over everything in this post so far, including my self-diagnosis of being genderfluid and the fact that this might mean I‚Äôm trans, even if I didn‚Äôt want to be.

My wife went to work another night shift. I distracted myself from the internal gender identity crisis I was going through by letting myself fall into that ‚Äòaltered sexuality‚Äô mindset again. Instead of worrying about labels and diagnosis, I was once again focused on loving my body and the thrill of my new legs. I reshaved them to get rid of the stubble, and felt a sudden urge to paint my toenails. I decided to just do it, throwing caution to the wind. When I was finished, I of course loved how my feet looked, they looked pretty and sexy to me, and since I‚Äôm so unaccustomed to thinking of myself as being ‚Äòattractive‚Äô at all, this felt like even more evidence that yep, I guess I really am genderfluid. So, while my wife was at work, I sent her the letter, telling her that if she had some downtime, I wanted her to read it and let me know what she thought. 

I think the letter kind of scared her. My usage of the label ‚Äòtrans‚Äô in the letter definitely made her uncomfortable, and I think she interpreted the letter as evidence that I might want to become a woman at some point in the future. She said that she was confused and couldn‚Äôt really tell what I wanted. She told me she was really worried that I would someday want to change myself with hormones, or change my body with implants, or change my voice, and that idea made her afraid, I think because doing those things would change who I am to her and of course that‚Äôs a scary idea. She wants to be in love with me for the rest of my life, she knows that she is in love with who I am right now, but what if she fell out of love if I completely changed as a person? I totally get it, and I know I‚Äôd grapple with the same type of struggle if the roles were reversed and she decided she wanted to transition to being a man. 

Anyways, her overall reaction to the letter definitely gave me a confusing mixture of feelings. On one hand, she seemed totally fine with me having a ‚Äúfeminine side‚Äù. She was excited to help me paint my nails, or try different hairstyles, or eventually do some ‚Äògirly things‚Äô together after covid like a spa day. That part of her reaction is awesome, and validating, and great. 

But on the other hand, she was definitely hung up about my self-diagnosis of genderfluid. I don‚Äôt know if she fully believes me when I say that I don‚Äôt want to become a woman, possibly because I was ‚Äúokay‚Äù with using the term ‚Äútrans‚Äù in my letter even if I didn‚Äôt feel that I can identify with it. 

I think the part that makes me feel a little bit bad about her reaction to my ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù letter is that now I have this lingering feeling, like, ok she might accept me for who I am today, but what if she ends up being right? What if 10 years from now I decide that I do need to transition or something? And what if I were to do that and she wasn‚Äôt able to completely accept me? I think she would try her absolute hardest but at the end of the day, it would be such a massive change in both of our lives that I wouldn‚Äôt blame her for not being able to do it. I try to tell myself that this is a silly line of thought though, that I shouldn‚Äôt worry about a version of myself that doesn‚Äôt currently exist. But it‚Äôs hard to completely ignore that tiny bit of worry. 

I think this is maybe a problem with trying to grab labels, terms, and definitions as diagnoses, especially so early into the process of questioning who or what you are. I‚Äôm not as educated as I can be on these issues, and neither is my wife. I feel like I had enough knowledge and awareness of gender issues to support that community as a cis straight man, but now that I‚Äôm questioning my cis-ness (and to be honest, also my straightness), it feels pretty overwhelming to try to find a label that matches my mindset, especially when that mindset is evolving and changing day by day. 

So anyways, back to the story: The next day, while my wife was asleep, I did a bit more reading, and came across a term I hadn‚Äôt seen before. This term was ‚Äúgender non-conforming‚Äù, and it immediately resonated with me, I think because it seemed to describe actions instead of identity. Me shaving my legs is 100% a non-conforming action to take as a cis-man, and I know that I liked taking that action. I knew that I wanted to do more things that are non-conforming in the future, with my wife, and it felt right to want those things. I feel like identifying with this label gave me the freedom to want these new things without changing who I am fundamentally. I think this is what I thought gender fluidity was, but now that I have some understanding of both labels, I like ‚Äògender non-conforming‚Äô a lot more.

It also gives me a feeling of empowerment: gender roles suck, I‚Äôve always thought so (and so does my wife). By refusing to conform with some traditional aspects of masculinity, I‚Äôm demonstrating my displeasure with these societal roles, and I like how that feels.

When my wife woke up, we talked a lot more, and I think this conversation made us both feel better. I showed her what I read about ‚Äúgender non-conforming‚Äù, and she agreed that that term made her feel more comfortable too. At the very least, it gives me something to think about myself that doesn‚Äôt scare me or my wife at all, which creates the freedom I need to explore this more.

We had sex that night, and it was incredible to get to feel open about myself. I took on a more submissive role than I ever have before, I unashamedly rubbed my smooth legs against hers, and kept thinking about how sexy my feet looked. It was incredible, and I also realized that the entire time, I wasn‚Äôt worried about whether I was having sex as a ‚Äòman‚Äô or as a ‚Äòwoman‚Äô. I was having sex as myself, fully and without any filter. If my body wanted to assume a submissive, feminine pose, I let it. If my body wanted to moan or make noises, I let it. If I wanted to grab her and switch to a more masculine position, I did so. It was a freedom I had only ever felt in my private, ‚Äòaltered sexuality‚Äô sessions, but this time it was with the person I love and I wasn‚Äôt ashamed at all.

Remember way earlier when I mentioned feeling like my wife and I were almost merging into one entity when our sex was really good? In a way, I almost feel like this is happening on a broader, more permanent level. By freeing myself of all worry about my role and expectation based on my gender, it feels like I‚Äôm closer to her now than I ever have been, both sexually and non-sexually. 

For example, since shaving my legs, I‚Äôve started to dislike a lot of my super masculine boxer-style underwear, and I asked my wife to help me shop for some new ones. I found a website that sells underwear purely by style and not by men/women categories, and it was such a great feeling to shop with my wife in a completely genderless mindset. We ended up each getting something with the same style (just different sizes), and it was somehow such a good feeling that she and I weren‚Äôt categorizing ourselves differently. I also picked out a thong for myself and just the fact that she was sitting there with me, helping me pick it out was so reassuring and affirming. 

I‚Äôve learned so much about myself over the last week, and I know that I still have more self-discovery ahead of me. I wanted to share this because writing it all out helps me reflect on it, but also because I think there‚Äôs something to be said for the danger of reaching for labels and diagnosis, especially so early into a ‚Äòquestioning‚Äô phase. When I finally let go of finding the perfect label or perfect term, and just focused on doing what I want to do, regardless of what that might define me as, I started finally feeling happy and able to share my full self with my wife.

Some day, I think it‚Äôd be awesome if I could build up the courage to show off this feminine side of me more publicly. But for now, especially when this is so new and different, I‚Äôm perfectly content to just be myself around my wife. I love her so much and I‚Äôm so glad I opened up to her. If you made it all the way through this, wow, thank you so much for taking the time to read about my experience.

And while letting go of labels and terms was helpful for me to keep exploring myself, if I said anything that is incorrect, or problematic in any way, especially about the terms and labels I described, please let me know! (Especially if I accidentally said anything that could be transphobic). I‚Äôm always looking to broaden my understanding of myself and other people. If anyone reads this story and feels like there actually is a term that fits very close to what I‚Äôve described, I definitely would love to hear it. If anything, knowing which topics and labels I should read more about will only improve my understanding, as long as I‚Äôm not so eager to immediately apply them to myself. In general, I still feel like I‚Äôm actively ‚Äúquestioning‚Äù who I am, so if you feel like you have some insight after reading this, please do share it. Thank you so much!"	"I skimmed because I have Can't Focus Disease, but I will say that identities aren't diagnoses. they're what words make you comfortable. like, I would technically ""qualify"" as demiboy, but that's not a term that resonates with me, even though it applies. 

I'm glad you found words that make you feel at home in your body. solidarity my friend"	km04qj	NonBinary	1	1.0	2020-12-28 22:02:52
Should my partner have to come out for my parents to respect them?	I (f) met my partner (nb) a few years ago before they began transitioning. My parents were introduced to them from the previous name and still use that name and the wrong pronouns. Since they began transitioning, I've been using their preferred name and pronouns. My parents have caught on and asked why and I explained that my partner is just more comfortable this way but my parents don't understand. They say that if my partner wants to be seen and referred to in that way, then they need to come out and say it. For reference, my partner and my parents do not get along well. My partner doesn't care much about coming out to my parents because they don't think my parents will respect them either way. The reason I'm asking though is that it's important to me that my parents respect my partner. I'm worried they might be transphobic and I don't know how to proceed if that's the case.		ntpfko	NonBinary	1	0.99	2021-06-06 16:23:16
Work Woes	"I‚Äôm looking for some advice (hopefully this is allowed) Sorry for the formatting I am on mobile. 

I‚Äôve identified as non-binary for quite a while now and I am out to most of the people in my life. However, I transitioned whilst at a teaching/tutoring job and I still haven‚Äôt ‚Äúcome out‚Äù at work.

I don‚Äôt think my manager or co-workers would care all too much and they would probably make the effort to use my pronouns I hope - my manager does have a lot of traditional gender views but they seem reasonably open to differing identities and my co-workers would be fine and I don‚Äôt interact with them all too much. 

My students are likely to be very accepting as well, some have already asked my pronouns and vice versa. And they are kids; I live in a country where most schools would hopefully educate them on different gender identities. 

My issue is that because I teach one on one lessons, there are a variety of different parents I come into contact with even though my manager handles all the scheduling etc. I am still the teacher, doing meetings, assigning homework and so forth. 

If I come out at work, I would be worried some of my students would have to leave because their parents would be uncomfortable (had some interesting experiences with parents already because of how I look) Plus, I feel like I would have to basically ‚Äúcome out‚Äù everytime I meet a new student/parent and it would be tiring especially because I am also neurodivergent. 

I thought about coming out to my manager then asking if I could wear a pronouns pin/tag on my shirt? 

Does anyone know the feels or have any advice?"	"Whew     that's a tough one. Very relatable too... 

Have you made a pros and cons list? That's what usually helps me. 

Before officially coming out to students I would talk to the manager, to see their reaction and if they have your back when parents get difficult. I come from a family of teachers and having your boss behind you is a huge plus. 


That's what I would do.       Hope this helped a bit :) 
Good luck!
Thank you so much, I appreciate your reply. Pros and cons list is a good idea - will do one with my partner‚Äôs help as I tend to favour cons. 

Yes, definitely manager first and if they don‚Äôt side with me I may consider handed in notice but would need to secure another job before that. Unfortunately I do see myself running into similar issues but at least I could be my non-binary self from the start in interviews, its all a bit ahhh 

Wishing you the best in all your life journeys ‚ú®
Seems like a good plan. I hope everything works out - I reeaaally do!!!     Have a magnificent day!! :D"	wd1dek	NonBinary	1	1.0	2022-07-31 22:53:12
Doing Research On Disparities In Health Care Outcomes For The Trans And Non-Binary Community - Looking For Resources!	" Tldr: I'm doing a research assignment about trans and nonbinary healthcare and would love any personal anecdotes and resources.

I'm a health sciences student currently taking a Cultural Aspects Of Health class, where we learn about communicating with and to cultural groups outside of our original cultural bias. As health care providers, there's an early push to accept certain viewpoints and dynamics between yourself and a patient, which often becomes this attitude of self-importance that can lead to miscommunications with patients. This, along with pre-established ideas about patient populations, can negatively affect treatment/care outcomes for many groups.

Our final project for the class is doing a presentation on the health outcomes for a group of our choice. One of my siblings is in the process of transitioning ftm right now, so I'm really interested in learning about what barriers or biases trans and non-binary individuals face in trying to get quality health care. If anyone is interested, I'd really appreciate some resources and insight on these points:

1. ""Identify resources that providers may access when caring for a specific cultural population."" Despite years of college and internships, a lot of doctors don't really have a good idea what departments to refer their trans and non-binary patients to and where to get resources so they can provide the best care. If you have reputable websites or help centers for trans and non-binary health care, I would really appreciate links to them.
2. ""Investigate opportunities and challenges that a specific cultural group/sub-group face in obtaining and utilizing unbiased healthcare."" What are some the unique challenges trans and non-binary individuals face in trying to obtain the best care possible? Health insurance bias, barriers in access to surgery/hormones/ect, discrimination in entering health care, anything that makes obtaining care harder.
3. ""What are some beliefs, customs, and behavioral patterns of a cultural group/sub-group in the United States society that should be considered and understood by a health care provider?"" If a health care provider has a Hmong patient who cannot do repeated blood tests due to their beliefs, they might be frustrated and label it as non-compliance if they aren't first aware of those beliefs. In the context of the trans and non-binary community, are there reasons individuals may avoid or be hesitant to obtain care, such as fear of misgendering/invasive questions? What should a doctor understand so they can provide sympathetic and compassionate care?
4. ""Relate strategies to address the unique health care needs among various cultural groups and sub-group."" Are there any resources I can look into for learning about the unique health care needs of trans and non-binary patients, and how health care providers can address these?

I'll also be going to [r/ftm](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/) and r/MtF for more information. Seriously, if you've taken the time to read this long post and are comfortable providing me with resources for my presentation, thank you!"	"I changed my gender to non-binary on my care providers app (university backed health care) and it prompted that I needed to schedule a mammogram as a result. Am amab, and found that amusing.
For point 1, my first thought is the WPATH standards, though they certainly have some problems. Planned Parenthood is a good resource in a lot of cases, with access to informed consent HRT. Local transgender/non-binary groups are an obvious suggestion, but are going to vary depending on where the provider is located.

For point 2, probably the biggest barriers are cost and bias. Insurance isn't legally required to cover transition care in a lot of cases, or may consider some procedures to be elective when they really aren't (but might be in other circumstances). As far as bias goes, there are plenty of doctors out there who don't believe transgender and non-binary identities are real, or may have reservations about treating a trans/non-binary patient for a number of reasons from religious grounds to lack of training in the kinds of care we need. Of particular note in the bias arena is the prevalence of Trans Broken Arm Syndrome. ""Doctor, I fell off my bike and broke my arm, can you help me?"" ""Sure, but first let's talk about your gender. Have you tried therapy?"" I've been turned away from care where the doctor won't even see me for things that are clearly within their scope and training, to doctors who will see me but literally talk about nothing I'm seeking care for because they focus solely on my gender. Doctors in the US healthcare system are afforded a lot of latitude in their personal practices, and those that are biased against transgender and non-binary patients exercise that regularly. And it's particularly problematic in rural areas, where access to other providers may be limited, which brings us back around to cost since it's more expensive to drive to another city to seek care and miss work etc.

For 3, my two top concerns are addressing patients respectfully and asking appropriate questions related to care. Forms should have fields that describe things that actually matter, for example don't ask about gender if what you really mean is sex; don't skip pregnancy questions just because someone identifies as a man. Have a write-in option for pronouns and true name (if different from legal name), and train all staff from doctors to sanitation crew to respect what's written on the chart. And don't ask me about my genitals when I'm in for a broken arm; keep questions directed to the care at hand, and don't use position authority to satisfy personal curiosity. Many patients won't know if these questions are relevant or not, and will feel pressured to answer, even though it will have no bearing on the assessment or treatment. Also, recognize that we're routinely denied access to healthcare and refused respectful address. Many of us specifically avoid care for these reasons, or may have maladaptive behaviors that can produce medical issues. Self harm is an obvious possibility, but discomfort using gendered bathrooms at work or school can result in a patient not drinking fluids, resulting in frequent UTIs (ask me how I know).

For 4, I mean you could ask here and get a laundry list. I'm happy to provide a bunch of concerns and unique care needs if that would be helpful. I don't have a specific resource in mind that would list them though.

Honestly the resources you're asking for don't really exist, or are not so well known that I've heard of them despite working in healthcare for a decade *and* being non-binary. I'm guessing one of the outcomes of your research is that a centralized resource for healthcare providers to understand gender-diverse patients and their needs is sorely needed."	qprdln	NonBinary	1	1.0	2021-11-09 00:28:47
advice for questioning my gender	"sorry that this is super long. ive been a lurker since forever but im finally posting my story.

im 20 years old. im doing all the right things. i work out, i sleep good, i have a great social life, i'm studying what i love and doing well at it, i eat well, i have hobbies that allow me to express my emotions (making art and music), i have a good sex life, my relationship with my parents is pretty good. im diagnosed with depression and anxiety, been medicated for a year and a half and have had a wonderful therapist for 2 years now (i've been in therapy for like 9 years but this is the first one i went to myself and the one i've had most success with). this has put my mental health on a steady incline over the past years. we talk a lot about my childhood and work on uncovering trauma and buried emotions. my mum has BPD, was extremely unstable throughout my childhood while my dad was a source of comfort and stability for me even though he lived far away. i idealised him a lot and am very much a carbon copy of him in many ways outside of the gender stuff. i'm aware that this definitely affects my ""gender identity"" but im not sure that that's a bad thing (aren't all facets of everyone's identity influenced by their parents? why does that make them less real identities?) i also don't have any intense sexual traumas. i did have some very unpleasant sexual experiences with cis men from ages 17 to 18 but that was after i had already gone down the gender spiral so i don't see them as having caused/spurred my gender confusion (started at age 13 or 14 when i found out that trans people exist and i was like holy crap. havent stopped consuming trans and detrans content since other than a couple years there where i forced myself into femininity and just had a terrible time latching myself onto other people for validation and care).

my therapist not great with the gender stuff because she's quite old and doesn't have much knowledge, but she does her best to understand where i'm coming from and is always questioning why i feel that i want to be seen as a man, or why i feel that i can't be strong, powerful, desirable etc as a woman. answer obviously has to do with my mother not being a great role model.

i have recently found more of a queer community irl and this has made me feel a lot more comfortable to explore my identity. i bought a binder and i feel pretty good when i wear it-- i really love the way i look with a flat chest. something else i should mention is that i'm very happy with my appearance in general. i do feel insecure re: my not being tall enough for my liking because i want to have a more intimidating presence but also just be a bit more lanky and masculine, and my hips being too wide because it makes me feel uncomfortable due to the sexual associations i've made with it. i wish my upper body was more muscular but im working on that. other than that, i love how i look. i don't think i look like a girl, when i look in the mirror i mostly just see ""some dude"" but i'm very happy with and confident in my appearance and particularly enjoy the masculine aspects of it though i do also like being a ""pretty boy"". the main issue is my chest and genitals. i guess it's dysphoria? not diagnosed so unclear. i just really wish i had the male parts. i dont care when im wearing clothes or even when im naked by myself, but it causes a lot of issues in the bedroom. i feel so fulfilled when i am referred to as male, he/him etc during sex. and i don't even mean in a fetish or arousing way. i just feel WHOLE. like everything comes together inside me. i wish i could translate that to my daily life.

the whole gender thing is definitely a fixation... but yeah. i've told some close friends to use he/they pronouns for me and those make me feel nice. they make me feel seen. with everyone else i just say any pronouns and i usually get they and she depending on the circles im in. nothing bothers me super intensely though she has started to feel weird and alien, like it's kinda just wrong. one thing is i hate asking people to use certain pronouns for me, i find it super humiliating. i hate admitting that what people assume about me isn't what i want... that's probably just my pride.

i've been consuming detrans content for years trying to figure out if my own story fits into the ""before"" part of a detransitioner's timeline. i know everyone's experience is unique and stuff but i just have not been able to settle on where i fit in here. i just feel like i don't have that much repressed shit, what i do have i'm working on, and as i grow happier with my life i am more inclined to accept my feelings of gender variance and move towards living as a non-binary masculine person. i'm still very uncertain as to whether i want to medically transition. low dose t sounds so very appealing... all the changes sound great but i am very scared. part of me does feel like there's a girl inside me ???? but that girl definitely feels safer staying there and my front to the world being a masculine one. is that so wrong?

with regards to gender identity, i don't really have one. although my sexual identity is definitely male, so there's that (if im gonna let someone f&ck me, they have to address me as male, and if im gonna have a good time, i have to actually believe they see me as male). i've read all the gender theory, yes including the rad fem stuff, but at the end of the day i just see myself as someone who was raised to be a girl, was pretty fine with it until i wasn't, and is now just tryna figure it all out. my current approach has been to try not to be so conclusion-geared and accept my uncertainty as a fine state of being, even though it's frustrating.

Why Does Gender Even Exist in Today's Society	" , Do Gender Roles Serve Any Positive Purpose?""Gender refers to the characteristics of women, men, girls and boys that are socially constructed. This includes norms, behaviors and roles associated with being a woman, man, girl or boy, as well as relationships with each other. As a social construct, gender varies from society to society and can change over time."" World Health Organization.Dedicated to Eva, with love and squalor.The above definition of ""gender"" is one I picked because it seemed to most cleanly define the true rigid definition of the word. There are many other definitions out there, but they are not largely differing, one from the other. In order to deconstruct my own definition of gender and what it means to me, being that it is clearly a subject to be take personally, I needed a clear starting pointMy daughter Eva is 22. They are in Philly right now in a holding pattern. They were lucky and were able to finish their degree with only the last few months being online. Their degree is in neuroscience and their minor in anthropology. They're smart. They had an internship they were going back to, but life is weird now and they aren't certain what they'll do. They works part time in the B&N at Temple, hangs out with their friends, and practices skateboarding while exploring the city, and sometimes we talk. Well, we talk a fair amount, about real stuff. At times we joke around and sometimes one of us is in a foul mood. We're very similar. Very. We're odd. They're authentically Eva, and for the most part, I get them. We send each other music and weird pop culture via youtube. Sometimes we are friends. Sometimes we argue like any mother/daughter. I like them. Its easy to love a child. Liking is a different matter.Life has been a lot easier the past year. Last year was hopefully the nadir of my medical. neurological, and emotional, and whatever else might be differ me from others. I have tried to stop referring to myself internally as ""sick"", ""messed up"", ""mentally ill"", ""weird"", ""damaged"". Many of them are true. I do have a severe mood disorder, but I need to differentiate the diseases from how I think of myself--which is nearly impossible as they are deeply intertwined, but is a start to a more positive outlook of who and what I am. I feel I have been fortunate to have been nearly totally deconstructed over the course of my last 25 years and be given the opportunity to be rebuilt nearly from scratch. Nothing has come easily, but now suddenly everything seems easy. I wake up in the mornings without the knots of anxiety I've had almost my entire life, including childhood, and, obviously, its from childhood I've had to begin the reconstruction. Not in an organized fashion based on one ideology, but in questioning and reassessing how I think about myself and who I am as a person in very, very basic ways, and why do I think why do I define myself in certain ways. Even much of this has seemed to come with ease. Things are falling into place. I've really altered almost everything I've thought of that's fundamental in how I think of myself, and how that applies to how I look at the world as a whole. I had to consider myself nothing in order to get to a place where I can think of how I can be me.One of the things I'll talk to them about, or bust on them at times has been their gender politics. I'm fine with whatever they are,. They're gender fluid, they say.. They have no particular interest in romantic relationships at this time. They have seen a lot of unhappy marriages, so I'm not surprised its not something they\]would feel particularly drawn to. My husband Eric and I have had a very happy marriage for 11 years now, but those formative years are tough to recover from. Their own relationship with their father can be strained, and our family just is not the poster child for well functioning. Eva is the only one who is currently in contact with my parents and their older sister and my grandchildren, who all live very nearby. I would have thought less of romance at their age too, in every sense of the word, if I were their age now with their collective experiences.Our disagreements on gender politics frequently center on the ever expanding list of labels that are infiltrating the non binary world. I don't like labels. I don't like this alphabet soup of labels. They consider me to be old fashioned or uninformed about the Queer community, but I'm not. I'm all for being whoever you are, and in whatever way that applies to you. Dress however you want. Date whoever you want. Just be who you are. So I started thinking about labels and how deeply they impacted me, as a woman, growing up in the time and place that I was by the parents that raised me.Here I need to make the distinction between gender and sexuality. Sexuality is far more complicated. I know young men and women who are or have transitioned, and some are still attracted to their previous sex, while others are attracted to the now opposite. This is not my business. Its not yours either. This is a closed door. If someone chooses to tell you or the world who they are attracted to that's great. Be there for people. We need each other's support, because damage has been done. But someone's sexuality is none of your business. Whatever is in their pants is not your business. I would hope, however, that these matters are discussed before embarking on any kind of a romantic relationship. There, it is your responsibility to know and share in return.I was raised largely within traditional gender roles. I am 53 and born in Europe. My mother was from a poor German farming family with limited education at the time. There was no question to truly divert from these roles. However, in any struggle for survival among some of the worlds most struggling, gender roles may matter the least in many ways. Work needs to be divided and conquered for survival. Men are typically physically stronger, so it made sense for them to take up roles that required strength. Women spent a good deal of time and energy bearing and raising children. There are very different economic and social situations than those of us in First World countries find ourselves in.My father is a very educated Swiss man with a PhD in Chemistry. He, on the other hand, never seemed to consider my gender an issue. He may have seen far too much of himself in me, good and bad, to make those distinctions, but these are complicated relationships we speak of.I never had any dramatic issues regarding either sexuality. I am a straight female. Other incidents in life have badly damaged that sexuality, but it doesn't change my orientation. Gender, now, is a very different story. I was raised to be feminine, and in many ways I am. I like clothes and looking nice. I am a feminist, but that is part and parcel of my gender politics. Is that really all their is of my gender as defined by the feminine? I'd never considered that, but it may be the case. Most of the remainder of my identity is either gender neutral with some male qualities thrown in. I don't enjoy being the mother of young children. I loved my daughters and did my best, but it was not at all natural to me until I could associate with them as very young humans. I don't enjoy spending time with large groups of women. I never joined clubs. I don't share their interests. I'm not interested in cooking or manicures I never considered details of my wedding except that I would probably have one, and also a husband along with the expected children. I hated my wedding. I am not interested in decorating my home. My first husband wanted a traditional marriage. That was, for that and many other reasons, a disaster of biblical proportions, considering my family's history of depression thrown in as well. I walked out after 13 years and that was that.We never would have married had we not had a child I was raising myself, miserably, for nearly two years. I moved from NJ to Ohio for a year to live with my brother, but was essentially homeless, because despite my degrees, single women could not afford to work and pay for childcare singlehandedly. Living with my parents was out of the question. Marriage took everyone off the spot.My second marriage was done via courthouse. I was always the smart kid, and my interests still range more in the realms of offbeat pop culture, music, books, running and writing. My best friends have always been male. My husband's best friends have always been female. We have been friends since we were teenagers in college. We don't even consider traditional gender roles because we don't, literally, consider them. There are things that need to be attended to in a household and a marriage. Who does what does not matter to either of us. He also accepts my fierce independence, which many would consider risky behavior because I am female. I run in remote areas. I've traveled alone. If I am at a greater risk for harm because I am often out of the house alone (god forbid), the onus is on those who would harm me, not on me, and I have been attacked several times.By the definition of and discussion of it, Eva says I can certainly consider myself gender fluid if I want to. But I don't think I do. Not because of what it means and may be taken by other people (unless you know you have a relationship with me, I do not care what you think of me. That much I have embraced, and how freeing is THAT). All in all, I consider myself a person. I will refer to myself as a girl, but that's out of convention. I'm fine with being a girl. I'd be finer with not having to be referred to by a gender at all, because do we have any NEED for genders anymore? What purpose do they have in our world today? Pursue whatever interests you want. Dress however you want. Be whoever you are. I would be fine with us finding a gender neutral pronoun and having us all use it who choose to. Eva and I have been discussing this. An umlaut should probably be required, for no reason except we like umlauts. There need to no traditional differences between gender roles anymore. Get rid of the labels of Queer and just be whoever the hell you are. Other people maybe having a problem with it is exactly that. Its their problem, not yours. They can and will project it onto you, but as long as you are harming no one, you have the right to have whatever name you want, ha and wear whatever clothes/tattoos/job/hair/whatever. It just doesn't matter anymore. The judging of such can only be damaging, and we have a sad history of the aftereffects of that being done.Gender roles served meaningful purposes for as long as man has been around. I'm a Christian. I understand that men are physically stronger and women weaker and survival was often not guaranteed. Having children, and lots of them, was necessary since so many died and family lineage needed to continue. That's no longer the case. I know there are arguments regarding the importance of gender roles in the bible. I could argue them. I'm certainly not now, and I'm certainly not going to argue homosexuality or transitioning or any other sexual matter as sinful or not, because we may have far divergent views on them, and I'm okay with that even if you are not. I don't believe Christ cares. Souls are sexless and genderless. Heaven will be be desegregated in every way.Here is the challenge for me. If I'm going to ignore appearance in terms of gender, I need to follow this to the end. I can be mean. I'll laugh at people I perceive as being unattractive in many ways. The mean ways-- people conventionally considered unattractive dressed in ways I consider unattractive. Who the hell gives me the right to put that on them? Its only reflection is on me. Its more labeling, and its ugly. I know I can be very ugly. I'm working on it. All things considered, I live and let live. I have a few truly authentic friends who are as authentic as I strive to be, and that's what I go for. I don't have the right to judge you if you like to party a lot or do things I wouldn't do or behave in a ways I choose not to as long as you are not harming another. And I do judge people. I need to be kind, and accept them for who they choose to be, but I don't have to choose to value their life values. I'm still working on making sense of making sense of it to me, so bear with me while I try to explain to you...in time.I understand there are vast implications here, but the only one that really comes to mind at the moment and would hit society in a heavy way would be in athletics, and would that really be a bad thing? I have very strong feelings about our institutions of hiring learning spending more time and money on scouting athletes and building facilities for them then on the actual higher learning. Yes, some individuals receive vast scholarships based on athletics. Personally, I disagree with this. Take that scholarship money and use it to educate those who have great potential in actual learning instead. And perhaps that could cause a cultural shift moving athletics as a competitive area of huge significance into the background and to bring the importance of education-both college prep and vocational to the forefront. I'm just tossing these out there. There are many other things to consider.There will be more to come. I have only just broken the ice on this line of thought and I need to take it to its end. An idea, a real idea, has to hold its properties to the very end of its logic. That takes me time. Meanwhile, for further clarification, I Eva will always be my daughter, even if she does prefer the personal pronoun of ""they"" for herself. Erasing gender roles will not lead to the end of civilization, just civilization as we currently accept it.As an addendum and an underscoring of what a hot topic this is, Eva was ALL over me for referring to them in the feminine during the initially published version.  As far as I can tell, I have changed all the pronouns to reflect their preference.  Frankly, I find it awkward as hell, as ""they"" refer to more than one person.  That is the nature of our language.  Hence, we probably need another pronoun to replace this one. Its just awkward and unintuitive...Also, Cavetown, you've given me a lot to think about, and a lot of that has influenced my thinking in the most beautiful of ways. Thank you. Make more music. You possess genius.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-itZVX-SUkI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-itZVX-SUkI&fbclid=IwAR2_nA_usYv6cJCVOojuoDm9ML69b4oK1csJgwfPLhHHyGpu8GOGN9mZR_8)YOUTUBE.COM**www.youtube.com149**People Reached**17**Engagements**Boost Unavailable**

For anyone who has gone through hrt, what was it like to go through different changes and how did it compare to your expectations?	"I have an appointment soon to discuss hrt with my provider and as it's coming closer, I find myself wondering if it will be weird hearing my voice change or what I should expect beyond what is typically listed on most lists I can find online. 

Was there anything you wish you would have known that no one tells you or talks about before hand? Is there anything you would or could have done differently in terms of self care and managing expectations to make the transition smoother or more affirming?

Thank you for taking the time to share. I'm getting a little nervous ( in a good way) that I'll be undergoing hrt soon, and would love some advice and support. Thank you!"	"Internal changes were wanted (calmness, hormonal balance), got coordination and balance and more for external use as well as all sorts of health benefits for myself thanks to the calm down, voice hasn't changed (MtF starting at age 37.5 in Dec 2019), 

Wasn't fussed about breast growth (some women have them and some don't for whatever reason) but got it and am happy with what I have now although from what I've been told they haven't stopped growing yet and to expect more change there!

 As for the rest of the body have softer skin, fat distribution has been going slow but steady and hair has grown to beyond my shoulders from the short length it was just pre hrt, 

Yeah, if you'd like to know more just message me back, kind regards, Kiera"	saebig	NonBinary	1	1.0	2022-01-22 22:46:50
